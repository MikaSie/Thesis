Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) — rules for the inclusion of goods in its scope
The European Union (EU) is taking action to tackle climate change. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is one of the measures to be implemented in the EU in order to combat climate change.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is an EU-wide scheme that aims to prevent carbon leakage, that is, the risk that some industries in the EU continue to emit greenhouse gases while their competitors in other countries do not.
The regulation applies from 2023.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The CBAM applies to the following goods:
cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, nitrogen oxides, and wet distillates (fuels).
It also applies to electricity imported from third countries (i.e. non-EU countries).
The regulation provides for the possibility to extend the scope of the CBAM to additional goods and services, such as plastic, textiles, glass and ceramics, as well as to the indirect emissions embedded in the goods listed in Annex II to the regulation.
Procedure for imports
Goods may be imported only by an authorised CBAM declarant who must:
ensure that the goods are imported into the customs territory of the EU;
keep records of the information needed to calculate the embedded emissions;
calculate the embedded emissions;
verify the embedded emissions;
pay the carbon price in the third country of origin;
report the embedded emissions in a CBAM declaration;
surrender CBAM certificates.
Goods may be imported only by an authorised CBAM declarant. The authorised CBAM declarant must be an importer established in a Member State. The authorised CBAM declarant must apply for the status of authorised CBAM declarant before importing the goods into the customs territory of the EU.
Embedded emissions
Embedded emissions are emissions from the production and use of goods. The regulation provides for the following rules for calculating embedded emissions:
for goods other than electricity, embedded emissions are determined based on actual emissions, in accordance with the methods set out in Annex IV to the regulation;
for electricity, embedded emissions are determined based on default values set by the Commission.
Carbon price
The regulation provides for the following rules for the carbon price:
the carbon price is paid in the third country of origin;
the carbon price is calculated as the average price of CBAM certificates;
the authorised CBAM declarant pays the carbon price by surrendering CBAM certificates;
the authorised CBAM declarant pays the carbon price by surrendering CBAM certificates.
CBAM certificates
The regulation provides for the following rules for the CBAM certificates:
the authorised CBAM declarant may sell CBAM certificates;
the authorised CBAM declarant must surrender CBAM certificates;
the authorised CBAM declarant may repurchase CBAM certificates;
the authorised CBAM declarant may cancel CBAM certificates;
the Commission calculates the average price of CBAM certificates;
the Commission publishes the average price of CBAM certificates;
the Commission may adopt implementing acts on the application of the methodology for calculating the average price of CBAM certificates and the practical arrangements for the publication of that price;
the Commission may adopt implementing acts on the application of the methodology for calculating the average price of CBAM certificates and the practical arrangements for the publication of that price;
the Commission may adopt implementing acts on the application of the methodology for calculating the average price of CBAM certificates and the practical arrangements for the publication of that price.

The regulation provides for the following rules for the registration of operators and installations in third countries:
an operator must register in the CBAM registry;
the Commission may deregister an operator;
