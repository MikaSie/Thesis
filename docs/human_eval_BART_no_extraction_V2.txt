Carbon border adjustment mechanism — EU countries’ contributions to the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets
Carbonborder adjustment mechanism— EU countries' contributions towards the EU's GHG reductions targets
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2023/956 — establishing a carbon border adjustment system
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a system for EU countries to contribute to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) by reducing their national GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels by the end of the year 2030.
It sets out the rules for the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out:
EU countries must reduce their GHG emissions by a minimum of 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels compared to their national levels and by 2050 compared to the level of the 1990 level;
the EU countries must also reduce their emissions by an equivalent amount by 2020 compared with their 1990 levels.
The EU countries are required to submit a report to the European Commission every 5 years on the progress they have made towards this target. The Commission publishes the results of the report on its website.
Each year, the Commission publishes a report on the implementation of the regulation. The report is published in the Official Journal of the EEA and the Commission forwards it to the Council of the EU.
which adopts the conclusions of the European Parliament and the Council.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLACE ENTER INTO FORCE?
The legislation entered into force on 10 May 2023.
   
BACKGROUND
The European Commission adopted the European Green Deal on 11 December 2019. It aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of greenhouse gases (‘greenhouse gases’) at the latest by 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from the use of resources.

European Green Deal (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* COVID-19 pandemic: a global warming pandemic caused by the COVID 19 pandemic in the early 1990s that had a major impact on the health and economic well-being of EU citizens.
* GHG: a greenhouse gas emitted by burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, which has the potential to increase the temperature of the planet by up to 2.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. It is also known as the ‘carbon dioxide’ (CO2) pandemic.
