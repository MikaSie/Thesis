Cross-border marketing of collective investment undertakings: minimum requirements for marketing communications
Cross-boundary marketing of mutual funds
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/852 — minimum requirements on marketing communications for the cross-border distribution of alternative investment funds
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that marketing communications to investors are fair, clear and not misleading.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must ensure that:
all marketing communications addressed to investors describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or units of a UCITS in an equally prominent manner, and that all information included in marketing communications is fair and clear.
A UCITS might be externally or internally managed, depending on its legal form.
All marketing communications must be clearly identifiable as such.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is responsible for ensuring that they comply with the requirements laid down in the regulation.
In addition, the European Investment Bank for Europe (EuVECA) and EuSEF (see summary) are required to provide investors with a key investor information document (KIID) and a key information document for the same collective investment undertaking while the legislative acts resulting from the Commission’s review of Directive 2009/65/EC are being adopted and implemented.
Pre-disclosure documents must be provided to investors in the form of a pre-marketing document. AIFMs, EuVEF managers and UCITS management companies must ensure they provide a KIID for each UCITS before marketing to investors. A manager of a qualifying venture capital fund must also provide a similar document for AIFs.
Ex-ante verification of marketing communications should be carried out within a limited timeframe.
National authorities must also ensure that all marketing communications are carried out in a language easily understood by investors and that the information provided in them is not misleading or inaccurate.
Common principles concerning fees or charges
The regulation sets out common principles on fees and charges applicable to the marketing of UCITS. These include:
a minimum level of investment protection for UCITS investors;
a maximum level of protection for investors in relation to the fees charged by AIF managers;
an obligation on managers to inform investors of any fees charged to them by the AIF manager or UCITS manager.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets up a European network of liaison officers to assist the European Commission in the implementation of the EU’s common border management strategy.
It aims to improve cooperation between national border control authorities and the relevant EU agencies.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the tasks and responsibilities of the liaison officers.
The role of these officers is to:
assist the Commission in identifying and assessing the needs of EU countries in the area of migration;
coordinate the deployment and use of the information they collect and exchange of information;
act as liaisons between the Commission and other EU agencies;
cooperate with the relevant national authorities in the field of border control and border surveillance.

In order to facilitate their identification, family members of a EU citizen must bear a standardised title and code on their identity card.
Collection of biometric identifiers must be carried out in accordance with the rights and principles set out in the Charter, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
National authorities must:
ensure that appropriate and effective procedures are in place and that those procedures comply with the principles of fundamental rights and data protection principles;
take the best interest of the child as a primary consideration throughout the collection procedure;
keep a list of the competent authorities with access to the biometric data stored on the storage medium referred to in Article 3(5) of the regulation;
use the data for national use only when it is necessary for national purposes. After that period, those biometrics should be immediately erased or destroyed.
Where a country has designated more than one central authority to implement the regulation, it must designate which of those authorities will be the contact point for the implementation of this regulation.
Monitoring
The European Commission is to monitor the regulation’s implementation and take account every 6 years of its impact on fundamental rights. The Commission will publish online a compilation of the data and other evidence necessary for such monitoring.

The Commission may also impose duties on imports originating in the market economy of a third country if it considers that the imports are likely to have an adverse impact on the EU economy.
Where the Commission considers that protective measures are necessary, it can impose measures to protect the interests of the European Union industry.
Reviews and refunds
If an EU industry or any other interested party submit, normally within 2 years from the entry into force of the measures, sufficient information showing that, after the original investigation period and prior to or following the imposition of measures, export prices have decreased or that there has been no movement, or insufficient movement, in the resale prices or subsequent selling prices of the imported product in the Union, the Commission may reopen the investigation to examine whether the measure has had effects on the abovementioned prices.
In the case of refunds, the importer must submit an application to the commission. If the Commission accepts the request, it must publish a notice in the Official Journal announcing the actual expiry of measures pursuant to this regulation.

Reporting of violations of Union law: protecting whistleblowers (Council Directive)
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2015/420 on the protection of whistleblowers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to protect persons who report breaches of European Union law that are harmful to the public interest.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must:
establish internal and external reporting channels for the disclosure of breaches;
ensure that such breaches are not covered by national security legislation;
encourage and facilitate the exchange of information between national authorities;
protect the confidentiality of the reporting persons concerned.
The directive applies to all persons who are covered by the applicable professional rules of the EU.
It does not apply to:

Reporting and protection
Reporting persons must be protected:
within the organisation in which they work;
in the event of a breach falling within the scope of the directive;
when they report information protected by the relevant professional rules, provided that reporting that information is necessary for the purposes of revealing a breach.
National authorities must establish internal reporting channels and follow up on these reports. The reporting person must be informed of the nature of the breach and the reasons for their decision to report it. The national authorities must also inform the persons concerned of the reason for the decision to do so.
If the national authorities believe that a breach has been committed, they must inform the reporting person within 3 months of receiving the information. This may be extended to 3 months if the breach was committed by a third party or if the person concerned has not been informed of it within the previous 3 months.
Where a national authority considers that a reporting person is likely to be a threat to national security, it must inform that person and provide them with appropriate protection. This protection may include:
more favourable treatment and non-regression clauses;
protection against retaliation.
Measures for protection of persons concerned
The reporting person concerned must be provided with:
protection from any form of retaliation;
the protection of confidentiality of their identity;
information on the nature and content of the information they report;

EU financial assistance for COVID-19
EU financial aid for CoVID–19
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/227 — EU financial assistance to countries affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the European Union’s financial assistance instrument (EU Financial Instrument (EUFIS).
It allows the European Commission to grant loans to EU countries that are in difficulties or seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control.
KEY POINTS
The COVID‑19 outbreak has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic system of each EU country. It therefore calls for collective contributions by EU countries in the form of guarantees supporting the loans from the EU budget.
EU countries may contribute to the Instrument by counter-guaranteeing the risk borne by the EU.
The Commission must inform the Council when it receives a request for financial assistance from a country that is in difficulties. The Council then decides whether to grant the loan or to call on guarantees from EU countries. The Commission must conclude an agreement with a contributing EU country on the terms of the guarantee.
In the event of a failure to honour the guarantee, the Commission may draw on the margin available under its own resources ceiling for payment appropriations to the extent that it is deemed sustainable by the Commission, having regard, inter alia, to the total contingent liabilities of the EU, including under the balance of payments facility established by Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 (see summary).
The loan granted under the Instrument is disbursed in instalments.
Borrowing and lending operations are carried out in euros, with the European Central Bank (ECB) acting as the lender of last resort.
Lenders must:
provide the Commission with a portfolio of loans;
ensure that the loans are repaid in full;
make sure that they comply with the prudential rules laid down in the regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 30 March 2020.
BACKGROUND
The EUFIS was established to provide financial support to countries that have been affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
For more information, see:
‘CoVID’ (European Commission).

A recovery plan must be drawn up by the resolution authority and include:
a description of the value of the assets, assets, liabilities and assets that are to be returned to the CCP;
a list of creditors who will be covered by the recovery plan;
details of the recovery plans, including the terms and conditions for the recovery of assets, such as the amount of compensation to be paid to the creditors.

In the event of a failure of a CCP, the resolution authorities may:
suspend the activities of a clearing member;
require the provider of services and facilities to pay compensation to non-defaulting CCPs;

the EBA and other competent authorities provide the EBA with the information they need;
clearing members inform their clients comprehensively about the auction following the instructions received from the CCP, and the ECB and other parties involved in the resolution process are informed of the results of the auction.
When an EBA or other competent authority considers that a CCP no longer meets its obligations under the regulation, it must inform the other parties concerned.
Where a CCP does not comply with a resolution procedure, it is subject to the following obligations:
it must provide the relevant authorities with all the information it has requested;

Rail transport is one of the EU’s most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. It is the only transport mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990.
In line with the objectives set out in the European Green Deal, there is a need to transform the EU economy and to rethink policies, in particular in the field of transport and mobility.
To achieve these objectives, the European Union (EU) Railways Year 2020 aims to:
improve the efficiency of rail transport;
ensure the safety and security of passengers and freight;
reduce costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the EU;
encourage rail users to switch their transport to rail.
Coordination at EU level
EU countries are responsible for organising the activities of the Year at national level.
by 31 March 2021, the Commission must submit a report on the activities carried out during the Year to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (ESSC).
The Commission must report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the measures taken to achieve the objectives.

Interchange fees for debit card transactions: European Union rules on interchange fees for card transactions
Interchange fee fees for credit and debit cards
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on the harmonisation of interchange fees applicable to card transactions in the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to harmonise the interchange fees charged by banks for debit and credit card transactions.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to the following transactions:
transactions with commercial cards;

payments with payment cards issued by three party payment card schemes.
It does not apply to: transactions with payment card scheme and processing entities (e.g. payment card issuers and payment service providers) that are not part of the EU’s payment card network.
EU countries may decide to define a lower weighted average interchange fee cap applicable to all domestic debit cards transactions. This would be beneficial for card acceptance, card usage, the development of the single market and generate more benefits to merchants and consumers than a cap set at any higher level. It should not prevent EU countries from maintaining or introducing lower caps or measures of equivalent object or effect through national legislation.
In addition, EU countries may designate one or more competent authorities to act as competent authorities. These bodies must be independent from the parties. They must:
ensure that the relevant data are provided to the competent authorities;
deal with any disputes arising out of the interchange fee caps;
identify the different categories of cards and the different types of cards.
They must also deal with any out-of-court complaints and redress procedures arising from breaches of the regulation.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) is responsible for preparing draft regulatory technical standards to be adopted by the European Commission by 9 December 2015. The Commission must submit those draft standards to the European Parliament and to the Council by 9 June 2017.

Regulation (EC) No 596/2006 on sanctions applicable to euro area countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out specific sanctions for EU countries whose currencies are not the euro and which have not yet adopted a national budgetary framework.
It aims to ensure that the fiscal surveillance framework of the European Union (TFEU) is effective, dissuasive and proportionate to the nature, seriousness and duration of the financial difficulties faced by the EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU countries with a currency other than that of the euro, except Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (1), which are covered by the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). It does not apply to:
non-euro-area countries;
euro area countries that do not use the euro;
non euro-area EU countries that have not adopted a budgetary framework;
EU countries that are not participating in the stabilisation and growth pact (SSGP);
EU Member States that have adopted a budget framework that does not meet the medium-term budgetary objective (i.e. the EU’s financial stability and growth goal) but which do not have a budget deficit;
Member States that are part of the SGP.
The Regulation applies to the following measures:
interest-bearing deposits: the European Commission must lodge a deposit with the European Central Bank (ECB). The deposit must be converted into a fine within 10 days of the deposit being lodged with the Commission. The Commission may, on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request by the Member State concerned addressed to the Commission, recommend that the Council reduce the amount of the non-interest-banking deposit or cancel it. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority, amend the Commission’�s further recommendation. The decision imposing a fine is deemed to be adopted by the Council unless it decides by qualified majority to reject the Commission's recommendation. If the Commission decides to abrogate some or all of its decisions, the deposit is returned to the EU country concerned.
Manipulation of statistics: the Commission must investigate the putative misrepresentations made by the European Statistical System of Central Banks (ESCB). The Commission must report to the European Parliament and the Council on the findings of its investigations, including any comments submitted by the country concerned, and present its findings to the Council.
Penalties: the fines referred to in the regulation must be effective and dissuasive. The fines must be based on the seriousness, duration and seriousness of the misrepresentation.
If the Commission considers that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under the regulation, it may impose a fine on that Member State. The fine must not exceed €500,000.
In addition, the Commission may impose sanctions on the Commission for:
misrepresentation of statistics;
the manipulation of statistics and the falsification of economic and financial data; and
the falsification or distortion of economic or financial data.
Return of deposits: if the Council, acting under Article 126(12) TFEU, decides that the deposit has not been returned, the Member States concerned must return the deposit. The deposit will be converted to the fine.
Fiscal surveillance framework: the regulation sets out the following sanctions:
fiscal surveillance: the imposition of sanctions on Member States for failing to comply with their budgetary obligations;
sanctions on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM): the imposition by the Commission of sanctions based on a number of criteria, including:
the size of the deficit,
the level of the debt and the level of debt-to-GDP ratio;
a breakdown of the gross domestic product (GDP) ratio,
gross domestic product per Member State;
gross national income per capita,
total public debt and gross national income.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The legislation has applied since 1 January 2007.
BACKGROUND

EU rules on the labelling of fuel-efficient tyres (Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 and Regulation (EU) 2019/2021)
EU rules governing the labelled performance of tyres (Recast)
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 552/2019 — rules on fuel efficiency and performance requirements for tyres
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to encourage end-users to purchase more fuel‐efficient tyres by providing them with harmonised information on the rolling resistance, tyre abrasion and tyre mileage.
It repeals and repeals Regulation (Euratom), which had to become law in the EU countries by 25 June 2020.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to tyres sold or offered for sale by distance selling. It does not apply to the sale of tyres through internet sales platforms, rather than directly from suppliers.
Fuel efficiency is a crucial element of the EU’s 2030 climate and energy policy framework and is key to moderating energy demand. To reduce the environmental impact of road transport, it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the label of tyres to encourage consumers to buy more fuel–efficient tyres. The regulation lays down minimum requirements for the wet grip of tyres and the snow grip of snow tyres.
EU countries must ensure that the tyre label is displayed close to the price indication and that the product information sheet can be accessed, including, upon request from the end-user, in printed form.
Tyre suppliers must ensure the accuracy of the tyre labels and product information sheets that they provide.
The tyre label must be displayed in accordance with Annex II of the regulation.
Suppliers must make technical documentation available to the authorities of EU countries other than those authorities indicated in paragraph 5 or to relevant national accredited bodies on request.
In addition, tyre distributors and importers must:
ensure that tyre labels comply with the requirements laid down in Annex II to the regulation;
make sure that tyre information sheets comply with Annex III of Annex II;
provide technical documentation to the competent authorities of the relevant EU countries.
Dealers must ensure:
the tyre label conforms to the specifications set out in Annex III;
the price indication is displayed in line with the price indicated in Annex IV;
inform consumers of the fuel efficiency limit values (LV) and the tyre mileage (M) that are applicable to the tyre.
Distributors must also ensure that tyres they sell conform to the requirements of Annex V of the legislation.
End-users must be informed of the conditions under which they can purchase tyres and of the penalties for infringements of the rules.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
   
It has applied since 25 June 2019.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a number of measures to improve the environmental performance of road tyres. These include:
rules on the tyre tyre label;
rules to encourage the re‐treading of tyres;
requirements for tyre tyres to reduce their weight.

Climate-neutrality objective: 2020-2030 EU climate change strategy
Climate - 2030 EU climate policy
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the EU’s objective to achieve a climate-neutral, low-carbon and low-emission economy by 2030.
It aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the long-term temperature goal set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’) by 2020.
KEY POINTS
The objective is to reduce GHG emissions to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2035. This is without prejudice to the review of the relevant EU legislation in order to enable the achievement of the target.
To achieve this objective, the EU is committed to stepping up efforts to tackle climate change and to delivering on the agreement adopted under the UN Climate Change Convention (the Paris Agreement).
The EU has adopted a number of climate action plans, including:
the 2020 climate action plan (see summary);
the 2030 climate strategy;
the climate neutrality objective.
The 2020 climate strategy is based on the objective of achieving a climate neutral economy. It aims to:
decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5 % below pre-Industrial levels by 2030;
reduce them by 3 % by 2050 compared to 1990 levels;
by 2 % below 1990 levels by 2050.
by 3 % above 1990 levels.
This is achieved by taking into account:
carbon capture and storage (CCS) emissions from all economic sectors, including transport, energy, agriculture, forestry, forestry and aquaculture, as well as from the transport sector;
sustainable development of the environment;
adaptation to climate change;
resilience and resilience.
EU countries are invited to establish a national climate advisory body to assist the Commission in its implementation of this regulation. This body must be independent of the International Panel of Climate Change Experts (IPC) and meet the independence of the Advisory Board.
In addition, the Commission must:
assess progress and measures taken by EU countries;
make recommendations to the European Parliament and the Council on how to achieve the 2020 climate targets;
prepare a report every 5 years on the progress made and measures to be taken;
ensure that the Commission reports are accompanied by legislative proposals where appropriate.
By 30 June 2021, the European Commission must review relevant Union legislation to ensure that the target is achieved. It must also consider taking the necessary measures, including the adoption of legislative proposals, in accordance with the Treaties.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?

If the EU country considers that an active substance does not meet the requirements, it may withdraw or amend the decision.
In exceptional cases, Member States may grant temporary authorisations for products that are not covered by the regulation.
Examination
The EFSA carries out an examination of the substance and the products it authorises. The results of the examination must be made available to the Commission and the European Parliament and to the European Economic and Social Committee (EEC).
If a substance is found to pose a risk, it is withdrawn from the market and the Commission must take a decision on whether it should be re-approved. The Commission may review the decision at any time.
Special cases
The Commission may decide to place on the market:
low-risk products;
products with a minor use extension;
plant protection products with a maximum duration of 15 years.

coconut oil;
tourist products originating in Costa Rica;
carrots originating in Nicaragua.
KEY POINTS
Implementing measures
EU countries must notify the European Commission of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. The Commission must inform the EU countries of any such trends and inform the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the reasons for the decision.
Imposition of provisional safeguard measures
The Commission must take the necessary measures to prevent or remedy the serious injury to EU industry and to facilitate adjustment. The measures must not apply for more than 200 calendar days. They must not exceed 4 years, including any provisional safeguard measure.
Provisional safeguard measures may be imposed if:
the import of a product originating in a non-EU country is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious deterioration in the economic situation of one or several of the Union's outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 TFEU;
there is a risk of a serious disturbance to the EU's internal market;
the country concerned is involved in the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with the EU;
an increase in imports of a particular product is likely to have a serious adverse impact on the EU economy.
If the Commission considers that a specific situation has arisen, it must immediately enter into consultations with the affected Central American country or countries to analyse and evaluate the situation on the basis of available factual data.
In the event that the Commission does not find sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the imposition of a safeguard measure, it may decide to impose a definitive safeguard measure instead. This safeguard measure must remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent, remedy and facilitate adjustment and to allow the EU industry to adapt to the situation.
A safeguard measure may be reviewed at any time by the Commission, at the request of an EU country or at its own initiative.
When the Commission decides to impose safeguard measures, it consults with the country or country affected by measures. It must notify all interested parties of the decision and explain the reasons therefor.
An investigation into the origin of the goods concerned is launched. The investigation must be published in accordance with Article 4(6) and (7) of the regulation.
Investigations
The investigation may be opened by either the Commission or by the EU country concerned. It is open to any interested parties who have submitted information to the Commission in connection with the investigation, provided that the information is relevant to the presentation of their case and not confidential within the meaning of Article 12 and that it is used only for the purpose for which it was requested.
Any information received must be used only as a basis for the investigation.
Where the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to believe that a particular situation has emerged which calls for safeguard measures to be imposed, the Commission may adopt a decision to impose definitive safeguard measures or to suspend or restrict imports of the products concerned. The decision must be communicated to the country concerned within 30 days of the date on which the decision to initiate an investigation is published in the Official Journal.

basic payment: the basic payment is paid for crops of sound, fair and marketable quality, i.e. crops that have a maximum yield of at least 25.5 tonnes per hectare.
Crop-specific payment: payments are paid for cotton, wheat, rice, maize and sorghum.
Direct payments: these are paid to farmers who have a minimum yield of no more than 25.
EU countries may use their national or regional reserves to allocate payments to young farmers and to farmers commencing their agricultural activity, as a matter of priority.
Flexibility between pillars
The basic payment schemes are based on a number of factors, including:
the number of hectares covered by the scheme;
the type of crops covered
the quantity and quality of the crops
the geographical coverage of the scheme
the duration of the reference period
the amount of the payments
the level of the payment.
In addition, EU countries may also apply the option of a ‘coupled support’ scheme, which allows farmers to benefit from a reduced number of payments depending on the size of their holdings.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
It entered into force on 1 January 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 August 2014.

Accreditation*, market surveillance and controls of goods entering the European Union
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 552/2008 on the accreditation of consumer products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules on the operation of accreditation* for consumer products in the EU.
It also sets out rules on market surveillance*.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all consumer products that are subject to the European Commission’s Community harmonisation legislation. It does not apply to products that have been authorised by national authorities.
National accreditation bodies
Each EU country must appoint a single national accreditation body. This body must be independent of commercial conformity assessment bodies. It must be established on a not-for-profit basis. The responsibilities and tasks of the body are clearly distinguished from those of other national authorities and must be based on a set of principles of non-competition and independence.
The Commission must communicate the recognition of a body pursuant to paragraph 1 to the EU countries and to national accredited bodies. The Commission and the body can terminate the agreement without cause at the expiry of a reasonable period of notice.
Market surveillance
EU countries must organise and carry out market surveillance as provided for in this regulation. They must establish, implement and periodically update their market surveillance programmes. Market surveillance authorities must carry out their duties independently, impartially and without bias. They should take account of risk assessment, complaints and other information.
If a product presents a serious risk to public health and safety, the Commission must inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons for its exclusion from the EU market.
Compliance with requirements
The European Commission must assess whether a product meets the requirements of the regulation. If so, it must issue an accreditation certificate to that product. If it is found to be in conformity with the regulation, the body must issue a CE marking to the product.
Where a product does not comply with the requirements, the EU country may withdraw its recognition of the product from the market and issue a non-conformity certificate.
In the case of a product that does not meet the requirements laid down in the regulation and which is imported from another EU country, it may be subject to a European Union (EU) ban on its marketing or importation.
Exchange of information — Community Rapid Information System
The Regulation sets up a rapid information system (RIS) for the exchange of information between EU countries’ market surveillance authorities and the bodies recognised by the Commission. The RIS is based on the information provided by the European Agency for Harmonisation and Quality Assurance (EQA).
The RIS allows EU countries to exchange information on products which are likely to present a serious threat to the public health or safety of consumers. It also allows the Commission to monitor the functioning of the market surveillance system.

Jurisdiction of judgments and consumer contracts in civil and commercial matters (Lugano Convention)
Judgement and consumer contract enforcement — Lugano Convention
SUMMARY OF:
Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments and Consumer Contracts in Civil and Commercial Matters concluded in Lugano, Switzerland
Decision (EU) 2017/852 on the conclusion of the convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION AND THE DECISION?
The convention establishes the jurisdiction of the courts of the European Union (EU).
The decision concludes the convention with the EU.
KEY POINTS
Judgments
The judgment or consumer contract is enforceable in the country in which the judgment has been or is to be enforced.
The judgments are classified and provided with an abstract.
Where a judgment/court settlement has been concluded in another EU country, the judgment or contract may be enforced in the EU country of origin.
If the parties do not agree on jurisdiction, the court hearing the action must apply Article 26 of this convention.
In proceedings concerned with the enforcement of a judgment, the parties must consult and decide by written procedure. This procedure must be open to any other experts whose presence is deemed appropriate.
When the parties have agreed that the court of origin has jurisdiction over the judgment, that court must give its decision without delay. If the outcome of proceedings in a court of a country bound by this convention depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.
Judges may also decide to enforce a judgment in another country if:
the parties have not agreed on jurisdiction;
the judgment has not been delivered or the contract has not yet been concluded;
there is a dispute between the parties as to the nature of the judgment; or
the court of the country where the judgment was delivered has jurisdiction to enforce the judgment.
A judgment may also be enforced where:
it has been delivered by a court other than the court in which it was delivered;
it was entered into by a party who has been granted legal aid;
a party to the case has been represented by a lawyer.
There is no obligation on the parties to inform the other party of the reasons for their refusal to comply with the convention. If they do not wish to do so, they may submit a communication to the court which delivered the judgment/approved the court settlement. This communication must be accompanied by a translation into English and French.
Consumers’ rights
The parties to a consumer contract have the right to:
have the judgment and contract enforced in their own country;
have their contract enforced by the courts in their country of residence;
be represented by an independent third party.
However, in the case of consumer contracts, a court in a non-EU country may enforce the contract in its own country. The court may also make enforcement conditional on the provision of such security as it may determine.
FROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?
They have applied since 1 January 2017.
BACKGROUND
   
The European Commission has adopted a number of implementing acts in the field of judicial cooperation. These include:
