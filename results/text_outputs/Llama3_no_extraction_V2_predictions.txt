Online transmission of TV programmes and retransmission of TV programmes
Online transmission of TV programmes and retransmission of TV programmes
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/789 – laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes, and amending Council Directive 93/83/EEC
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It aims to enhance access to a greater number of television and radio programmes across the EU by facilitating the clearance of rights for the provision of online services that are ancillary to the broadcast of certain types of television and radio programmes, and for the retransmission of television and radio programmes.
KEY POINTS
The directive lays down rules that aim to enhance cross-border access to a greater number of television and radio programmes, by facilitating the clearance of rights for the provision of online services that are ancillary to the broadcast of certain types of television and radio programmes, and for the retransmission of television and radio programmes.
The directive applies to:
ancillary online services, which consist in the provision to the public of television or radio programmes simultaneously with or for a defined period of time after their broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, as well as of any material which is ancillary to such broadcast;
retransmissions of television or radio programmes originating in another EU country.
The directive provides for a mandatory collective management of rights for certain types of programmes for retransmission services and for the transmission of programmes through the process of direct injection.
The directive does not oblige broadcasting organisations to provide such services across borders or operators of retransmission services to include in their services television or radio programmes originating in other EU countries.
The directive does not oblige broadcasters to provide such services across borders or operators of retransmission services to include in their services television or radio programmes originating in other EU countries.
The acts of communication to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, and of making available to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, occurring when providing to the public:
radio programmes;
television programmes which are:
news and current affairs programmes; or
fully financed own productions of the broadcasting organisation,
in an ancillary online service by or under the control and responsibility of a broadcasting organisation, as well as the acts of reproduction of such works or other protected subject matter which are necessary for the provision of, the access to or the use of such online service for the same programmes shall, for the purposes of exercising copyright and related rights relevant for those acts, be deemed to occur solely in the Member State in which the broadcasting organisation has its principal establishment.
Point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the broadcasts of sports events and works and other protected subject matter included in them.
Member States shall ensure that rightholders may exercise their right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission only through a collective management organisation.
Where a rightholder has not transferred the management of the right referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 to a collective management organisation, the collective management organisation which manages rights of the same category for the territory of the Member State for which the operator of a retransmission service seeks to clear rights for a retransmission shall be deemed to have the right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission for that rightholder.
However, where more than one collective management organisation manages rights of that category for the territory of that Member State, it shall be for the Member State for the territory of which the operator of a retransmission service seeks to clear rights for a retransmission to decide which collective management organisation or organisations have the right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission.
Member States shall ensure that a rightholder has the same rights and obligations resulting from an agreement between an operator of a retransmission service and a collective management organisation or organisations that act pursuant to paragraph 2, as rightholders who have mandated that collective management organisation or organisations. Member States shall also ensure that that rightholder is able to claim those rights within a period, to be fixed by the Member State concerned, which shall not be shorter than three years from the date of the retransmission which includes his or her work or other protected subject matter.
Member States shall ensure that Article 4 does not apply to the rights in retransmission exercised by a broadcasting organisation in respect of its own transmission, irrespective of whether the rights concerned are its own or have been transferred to it by other rightholders.
Member States shall provide that, where broadcasting organisations and the operators of retransmission services enter into negotiations regarding authorisation for retransmission under this Directive, those negotiations are to be conducted in good faith.
Member States shall ensure that it is possible to call upon the assistance of one or more mediators as provided for in Article 11 of Directive 93/83/EEC where no agreement is concluded between the collective management organisation and the operator of a retransmission service, or between the operator of a retransmission service and the broadcasting organisation regarding authorisation for retransmission of broadcasts.
Member States may provide that the rules in this Chapter and in Chapter III of Directive 93/83/EEC apply to situations where both the initial transmission and the retransmission take place within their territory.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It applies from 10 July 2020.

Summary 5:
Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/784 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure the smooth functioning of the digital single market in an open and democratic society by addressing the misuse of hosting services for terrorist purposes and contributing to public security across the Union.
It establishes a definition of ‘terrorist content’ for preventative purposes and provides for specific measures to address the dissemination of terrorist content online.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to providers of information society services that store and disseminate to the public information and material provided by a user of the service on request, irrespective of whether the storing and dissemination to the public of such information and material is of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature.
The regulation does not apply to providers of ‘mere conduit’ or ‘caching’ services, as well as to providers of domain name systems (DNS), payment or distributed denial of service (DdoS) protection services.
Definition of terrorist content
The regulation defines ‘terrorist content’ as material that incites or solicits someone to commit, or to contribute to the commission of, terrorist offences, solicits someone to participate in activities of a terrorist group, or glorifies terrorist activities including by disseminating material depicting a terrorist attack.
It also includes material that provides instruction on the making or use of explosives, firearms or other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) substances, or on other specific methods or techniques, including the selection of targets, for the purpose of committing or contributing to the commission of terrorist offences.
When assessing whether material constitutes terrorist content within the meaning of this regulation, competent authorities and hosting service providers take into account factors such as the nature and wording of statements, the context in which the statements were made and their potential to lead to harmful consequences in respect of the security and safety of persons.
The fact that the material was produced by, is attributable to or is disseminated on behalf of a person, group or entity included in the Union list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts and subject to restrictive measures constitutes an important factor in the assessment.
Specific measures
The regulation provides for a number of specific measures to address the dissemination of terrorist content online, including:
a requirement to preserve the removed content and related data for a period of 6 months in order to allow content providers sufficient time to initiate administrative or judicial review proceedings and to enable access by law enforcement authorities to relevant data for the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences;
a requirement to establish user-friendly complaint mechanisms and ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously and in full transparency towards the content provider;
a requirement to publish annual transparency reports containing information about action taken in relation to the identification and removal of terrorist content;
a requirement to put in place specific measures taking into account the risks and level of exposure to terrorist content as well as the effects on the rights of third parties and the public interest to information.
Competent authorities
The regulation requires the designation of competent authorities by the Member States. The competent authorities fulfil their tasks in an objective and non-discriminatory manner and do not seek or take instructions from any other body in relation to the exercise of the tasks under this regulation.
The Commission publishes a register listing the competent authorities designated under this regulation.
Removal orders
The regulation provides for a procedure and obligations resulting from removal orders requiring hosting service providers to remove or disable access to terrorist content, following an assessment by the competent authorities.
The competent authority submits the removal order directly to the contact point designated or established by the hosting service provider for the purposes of this regulation by any electronic means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the hosting service provider to establish the authenticity of the order, including the accuracy of the date and the time of sending and receipt thereof.
The competent authority should provide the hosting service provider with information on procedures and applicable deadlines at least 12 hours in advance of issuing for the first time a removal order to that hosting service provider.
Where the hosting service provider cannot comply with the removal order within one hour of its receipt, on grounds of force majeure or de facto impossibility, including for objectively justifiable technical or operational reasons, it should inform the issuing competent authority as soon as possible and comply with the removal order as soon as the situation is resolved.
The removal order should contain a statement of reasons qualifying the material to be removed or access to which is to be disabled as terrorist content and provide sufficient information for the location of that content, by indicating the exact URL and, where necessary, any other additional information, such as a screenshot of the content in question.
The competent authority should submit the removal order directly to the contact point designated or established by the hosting service provider for the purposes of this regulation by any electronic means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the hosting service provider to establish the authenticity of the order, including the accuracy of the date and the time of sending and receipt thereof, such as by secured email or platforms or other secured channels, including those made available by the hosting service provider, in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data.
It should be possible for the competent authority of the Member State where the hosting service provider has its main establishment or where its legal representative resides or is established to scrutinise the removal order issued by competent authorities of another Member State to determine whether it seriously or manifestly infringes this regulation or the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.
Penalties
The regulation provides for the possibility for the competent authorities to impose penalties on hosting service providers that fail to comply with the requirements of this regulation. The penalties may include fines and/or other penalties, such as the suspension or revocation of licences or authorisations.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 7 July 2021.

Regulation (EU) 2021/695 — the Horizon Europe Programme for research and innovation
Regulation (EU) 2021/695 — the Horizon Europe Programme for research and innovation
The Horizon Europe Programme is the new EU framework programme for research and innovation (R&I) for the period 2021-2027. It replaces the Horizon 2020 Programme, which ran from 2014 to 2020.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the Horizon Europe Programme for 7 years from 2021 to 2027.
KEY POINTS
The Horizon Europe Programme aims to:
strengthen the European Research Area (ERA) by improving the circulation of researchers and knowledge;
deliver on the EU’s strategic priorities and commitments;
support the EU’s values and the well-being of its citizens;
deliver scientific, technological, economic, environmental and societal impact in pursuit of these objectives.
The Programme will support the creation, better diffusion and transfer of high-quality and excellent knowledge and high-quality technologies in the EU, attract talent at all levels and contribute to full engagement of the EU’s talent pool, facilitate collaborative links and strengthen the impact of R&I in developing, supporting and implementing EU policies, support and strengthen the uptake and deployment of innovative and sustainable solutions in the EU’s economy, in particular in SMEs, and in society, address global challenges, including climate change and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), create jobs, boost economic growth, promote industrial competitiveness and boost the attractiveness of the EU in the field of R&I.
The Programme fosters all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, fosters market deployment of innovative solutions, and optimises the delivery of such investment for increased impact within a strengthened ERA.
The Programme will contribute to increasing public and private investment in R&I in the EU, thereby helping to reach an overall investment target of at least 3 % of the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development. Achieving that target would require EU countries and the private sector to complement the Programme with their own reinforced investment actions in research, development and innovation.
The Programme will benefit from complementarity with existing relevant European R&I roadmaps and strategies, as well as with important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs), where relevant, provided that related R&I needs are identified in the Programme’s strategic planning.
The Programme supports R&I activities in the field of social sciences and humanities (SSH). This entails advancing scientific knowledge in that domain and making use of insights and progress from SSH to increase the economic and societal impact of the Programme. Under the pillar ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’, SSH should be fully integrated across all clusters.
The Programme will support the EU’s industry in remaining or in becoming a world leader in innovation, digitisation and climate neutrality, in particular through investments in key enabling technologies that will underpin tomorrow’s business.
The Programme will support R&I in an integrated manner, respecting all relevant provisions in the framework of the World Trade Organization. The concept of research, including experimental development, should be used in accordance with the Frascati Manual developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), whereas the concept of innovation should be used in accordance with the Oslo Manual developed by the OECD and Eurostat, which follows a broad approach that covers social innovation and design. As in Horizon 2020, the OECD definitions regarding technological readiness levels (TRLs) should continue to be taken into account in the classification of technological research, product development and demonstration activities, and in the definition of types of action available in calls for proposals. Grants should not be awarded for actions where activities go above TRL 8. It should be possible for the work programme to allow grants for large-scale product validation and market replication for a given call under the pillar ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’.

Digital Europe Programme
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/694 establishing the Digital Europe Programme and repealing Decision (EU) 2015/2240
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) for the period 2021-202Y. The DEP is a key component of the European Digital Strategy, which aims to transform and modernise European industry, public services and public administration.
KEY POINTS
              
The DEP has 5 specific objectives, which are:
high-performance computing (HPC) (1);
artificial intelligence (AI);
cybersecurity and trust;
advanced digital skills;
deployment and best use of digital capacities and interoperability.
The DEP supports the digital transformation of industry and the wider use of essential digital capacities, in particular in the fields of HPC, AI, cybersecurity and trust, and advanced digital skills.
The DEP is implemented through projects that reinforce and widen the use of essential digital capacities, such as HPC, AI and cybersecurity, and through European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs).
European Digital Innovation Hubs
The DEP establishes a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), which act as access points for the latest digital capacities, including HPC, AI, cybersecurity, as well as for other existing innovative technologies available in fablabs or citylabs. EDIHs act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation.
The network of EDIHs is established through an open and competitive process from among entities designated by Member States. The Commission takes the utmost account of the opinion of each Member State before selecting a European Digital Innovation Hub in the territory of that Member State. The Commission and the Member States should avoid the unnecessary duplication of competences and functions at Union and national level. There should therefore be adequate flexibility when designating the hubs and determining their activities and composition.
The network might be further enlarged through a subsequent open and competitive process.
The network of EDIHs should ensure broad geographical coverage across Europe and should contribute to the participation of the outermost regions in the Digital Single Market.
The European Commission sets up the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) in cooperation with Member States.

Summary 12:
interoperability of electronic road toll systems and the exchange of information on failure to pay road fees
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/520 on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems and facilitating cross-border exchange of information on the failure to pay road fees in the Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure the interoperability of electronic road toll systems on the entire EU road network, urban and interurban motorways, major and minor roads, and various structures, such as tunnels or bridges, and ferries.
It also aims to facilitate the cross-border exchange of vehicle registration data regarding the vehicles and the owners or holders of vehicles for which there was a failure to pay road fees of any kind in the Union.
It introduces the European Electronic Toll Service (EETS) which aims to ensure the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the EU.
It does not apply to road toll systems which are not electronic within the meaning of point 10 of Article 2 of the directive.
It does not apply to small, strictly local road toll systems for which the costs of compliance with the requirements of the directive would be disproportionate to the benefits.
It does not apply to parking fees.
It does not apply to failure to pay parking fees.
It does not apply to failure to pay a road fee where the national law requires a notification to the user of the obligation to pay before a failure to pay a road fee can be established.
KEY POINTS

EU network of immigration liaison officers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1240 — on the creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to enhance the cooperation and coordination among immigration liaison officers* deployed to third countries by Member States, the European Commission and the European agencies by creating a European network of immigration liaison officers.
It also aims to ensure that immigration liaison officers better contribute to the functioning of a European network of immigration liaison officers by establishing a mechanism through which Member States, the Commission and European agencies can more systematically coordinate the tasks and roles of their liaison officers deployed in third countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation lays down rules to enhance cooperation and coordination among immigration liaison officers deployed to third countries by Member States, the Commission and European agencies, through the creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers.
It is without prejudice to the responsibility of Member State authorities, the Commission and European agencies for defining the scope and assignment of tasks and reporting lines of their respective immigration liaison officers, and to the tasks of immigration liaison officers within the framework of their responsibilities under Union and national law, policies or procedures, or under special agreements concluded with the host country or international organisations.
Tasks of immigration liaison officers
Immigration liaison officers shall carry out their tasks within the framework of their responsibilities determined by the deploying authorities and in accordance with the provisions, including those on the protection of personal data, laid down in Union and national laws and in any agreements or arrangements concluded with third countries or international organisations.
Immigration liaison officers shall carry out their tasks in accordance with fundamental rights as general principles of Union law as well as international law, including human rights obligations. They shall have particular consideration for vulnerable persons and take into account the gender dimension of migration flows.
Each deploying authority shall ensure that immigration liaison officers establish and maintain direct contacts with the competent authorities of third countries, including, when appropriate, with local authorities, and any relevant organisations operating within the third country, including international organisations, notably with a view to implementing this regulation.
Immigration liaison officers shall collect information, for use either at operational level, strategic level, or both. Information collected under this paragraph shall be collected in accordance with Article 1(2) and shall not contain personal data, without prejudice to Article 10(2). Such information shall cover the following issues in particular:
the European integrated border management at the external borders, with a view to managing migration effectively;
migratory flows originating from or transiting through the third country, including where possible and relevant, the composition of migratory flows and migrants’ intended destination;
routes used by migratory flows originating from or transiting through the third country in order to reach the territories of the Member States;
the existence, activities and modi operandi of criminal organisations involved in smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings along the migratory routes;
incidents and events that have the potential to be or to cause new developments with respect to migratory flows;
methods used for counterfeiting or falsifying identity documents and travel documents;
ways and means to assist the authorities in third countries in preventing illegal immigration flows originating from or transiting through their territories;
pre-departure measures available to immigrants in the country of origin or in host third countries that support successful integration upon legal arrival in Member States;
facilitating return, readmission and reintegration;
effective access to protection that the third country has put in place, including in favour of vulnerable persons;
existing and possible future legal immigration strategies and channels between the Union and third countries, taking into account skills and labour market needs in Member States, as well as resettlement and other protection tools;
capacity, capability, political strategies, legislation and legal practices of third countries and stakeholders, including, where possible and relevant, regarding reception and detention centres and the conditions therein, as relevant to the issues referred to in points (a) to (k).
Immigration liaison officers may render assistance, taking into account their expertise and training, in:
establishing the identity and nationality of third-country nationals and facilitating their return in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC, as well as assisting their reintegration, where relevant and possible;
confirming the identity of persons in need of international protection for the purposes of facilitating their resettlement in the Union, including by providing them, where possible, with adequate pre-departure information and support;
confirming identity and facilitating implementation of Union and national measures in respect of the admission of legal immigrants;
sharing information obtained in the course of their duties within networks of immigration liaison officers and with competent authorities of the Member States, including law enforcement authorities, in order to prevent and detect illegal immigration as well as combat smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings.
Notification of the deployment of immigration liaison officers
Member States, the Commission and the European agencies shall inform the Steering Board established in Article 7 of their plans for and actual deployment of immigration liaison officers, including a description of their duties and the duration of their deployment.
The activity reports referred to in point (c) of Article 8(2) shall include an overview of the deployments of immigration liaison officers.
Creation of local or regional networks of immigration liaison officers
Immigration liaison officers deployed to the same countries or regions shall constitute local or regional cooperation networks and cooperate, where and when appropriate, with liaison officers deployed by countries other than Member States. Within the framework of such networks, immigration liaison officers shall in accordance with Article 1(2), in particular:
meet regularly and whenever necessary;
exchange information and practical experience, in particular at meetings and via the secure web-based information exchange platform provided for in Article 9;
exchange information, where appropriate, on experience regarding access to international protection;
coordinate positions to be adopted in contacts with commercial carriers, where appropriate;
attend joint specialised training courses, when appropriate, including on fundamental rights, trafficking in human beings, smuggling of migrants, document fraud or access to international protection in third countries;
organise information sessions and training courses for members of the diplomatic and consular staff of the missions of the Member States in the third country, when appropriate;
adopt common approaches on methods for the collection and reporting of strategically relevant information, including risk analyses;
set up regular contacts with similar networks in the third country and in neighbouring third countries, as appropriate.
Immigration liaison officers deployed by the Commission shall facilitate and support the networks provided for in paragraph 1. In locations where the Commission does not deploy immigration liaison officers, immigration liaison officers deployed by European agencies shall facilitate and support the networks provided for in paragraph 1. In locations where neither the Commission nor European agencies deploy immigration liaison officers, the network shall be facilitated by an immigration liaison officer, as agreed by members of the network.
The Steering Board shall be notified without undue delay of the appointment of the designated network facilitator or where no facilitator is designated.
Joint deployment of immigration liaison officers
Member States may bilaterally or multilaterally agree that immigration liaison officers who are deployed to a third country or international organisation by a Member State shall also look after the interests of one or more other Member States.
Where two or more Member States jointly deploy an immigration liaison officer, those Member States may receive Union financial support pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 515/2014.
Steering Board
A Steering Board for a European network of immigration liaison officers is

Summary 17:
European Electronic Communications Code
The European Electronic Communications Code aims to boost investment in very high capacity networks and to provide end-users with a better internet experience. It also aims to ensure the efficient use of radio spectrum and to make the internal market for electronic communications more predictable and more consistent.
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It establishes a European Electronic Communications Code. This code covers both the provision of electronic communications networks and services.
The directive covers all types of electronic communications networks and services, including those using radio spectrum.
The directive replaces 4 directives on the subject: the authorisation directive, the access directive, the universal service directive and the regulatory framework directive.
KEY POINTS
The directive establishes a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services in the EU. It aims to ensure that:
very high capacity networks are progressively rolled out across the EU;
end-users are provided with a better internet experience;
the radio spectrum is efficiently used;
the internal market for electronic communications is more predictable and consistent.
The directive defines 3 types of services which may partly overlap:
internet access services: these are services that enable subscribers or end-users to connect to a public communications network and access and exchange data using internet protocol technology.
interpersonal communications services: these are services that enable interpersonal and interactive exchange of information, covering services like traditional voice calls between two individuals but also all types of emails, messaging services, or group chats.
services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals: these are services that enable communications between a finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons, which is determined by the sender of the communication.
The directive also defines 3 types of networks:
fixed networks: these are networks which enable communications between end-users via a wired geography.
wireless networks: these are networks which enable communications between end-users via a wireless geography.
very high capacity networks: these are networks that are capable of providing at least 30 Mbps to each end-user, and which are promptly upgradeable to gigabit speeds.
The directive establishes a number of objectives for the national regulatory authorities. These are to:
ensure the availability of very high capacity networks across the EU;
ensure the availability of uninterrupted 5G coverage for urban areas and major terrestrial transport paths;
ensure that all households in each Member State have access to electronic communications networks which are capable of providing at least 100 Mbps and which are promptly upgradeable to gigabit speeds;
ensure that 5G coverage is available across the Union for the most important socio-economic drivers such as schools, transport hubs and major providers of public services, and highly digitised businesses.
The directive also establishes a number of principles that national regulatory authorities must respect. These are to:
ensure that the regulatory framework is technologically neutral;
ensure that the regulatory framework is market driven;
ensure that the regulatory framework is cost oriented;
ensure that the regulatory framework is risk based;
ensure that the regulatory framework is proportionate.
The directive establishes a number of principles that national regulatory authorities may respect. These are to:

Security of gas supply – EU legislation
SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – EU LEGISLATION
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It establishes a new legal framework to safeguard the security of gas supply in the EU. It replaces Regulation (EU) No 994/2010.
KEY POINTS
              
The security of gas supply in the EU is the responsibility of the EU, the Member States and the gas industry. It is achieved through the most cost-effective measures and in such a way that the gas market is not distorted.
The main objective of this regulation is to ensure an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the EU, in particular to protected customers in the event of difficult climatic conditions or disruptions of the gas supply.
The regulation defines risk groups based on the main gas supply sources and routes. It establishes a cooperation mechanism within each risk group to mitigate the identified risks and implement the most cost-effective measures for EU consumers. It also establishes a burden-sharing mechanism for solidarity measures.
The regulation also defines a new solidarity mechanism, which provides for solidarity between Member States to ensure gas supply to customers in the event of a crisis. This solidarity is a measure of last resort that applies only in an emergency and only under restrictive conditions.
The regulation requires Member States to ensure that gas customers are protected against the negative effects of a disruption of gas supply. It defines customers protected under the solidarity mechanism as households and certain essential social services.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for the Commission to request access to key gas supply contracts. It also establishes a mechanism for the Commission to assess the preventive action plans and the emergency plans.
The regulation establishes a common risk assessment mechanism to assess the risks to the security of gas supply. It establishes a common and national risk assessment mechanism to assess the risks to the security of gas supply.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for Member States to conduct tests in order to assess the emergency plans.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for Member States to update their preventive action plans and emergency plans.

SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It sets up a framework for the labelling of energy-related products and for the provision of standard product information on their energy consumption during use, in order to enable customers to choose more efficient products and reduce their energy consumption.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies to energy-related products placed on the market or put into service.
It provides for the labelling of those products and the provision of standard product information regarding energy efficiency, the consumption of energy and of other resources by products during use and supplementary information concerning products, thereby enabling customers to choose more efficient products in order to reduce their energy consumption.
The regulation does not apply to:
second-hand products, unless they are imported from a third country;
means of transport for persons or goods.
The regulation defines:
energy-related product (or product): a good or system with an impact on energy consumption during use which is placed on the market or put into service, including parts with an impact on energy consumption during use which are placed on the market or put into service for customers and that are intended to be incorporated into products;
product group: a group of products which have the same main functionality;
model: a version of a product of which all units share the same technical characteristics relevant for the label and the same model identifier;
model identifier: the code, usually alphanumeric, which distinguishes a specific product model from other models with the same trade mark or the same supplier’s name;
equivalent model: a model which has the same technical characteristics relevant for the label and the same product information sheet, but which is placed on the market or put into service by the same supplier as another model with a different model identifier;
making available on the market: the supply of a product for distribution or use on the EU market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge;
placing on the market: the first making available of a product on the EU market;
putting into service: the first use of a product for its intended purpose on the EU market;
manufacturer: a natural or legal person who manufactures a product or has a product designed or manufactured, and markets that product under its name or trademark;
authorised representative: a natural or legal person established in the EU who has received a written mandate from the manufacturer to act on its behalf in relation to specified tasks;
importer: a natural or legal person established in the EU who places a product from a third country on the EU market;
dealer: a retailer or other natural or legal person who offers for sale, hire, or hire purchase, or displays products to customers or installers in the course of a commercial activity, whether or not in return for payment;
supplier: a manufacturer established in the EU, the authorised representative of a manufacturer who is not established in the EU, or an importer, who places a product on the EU market;
energy efficiency: the ratio of output of performance, service, goods or energy to input of energy;
harmonised standard: standard as defined in point (c) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council;
label: a graphic diagram, either in printed or electronic form, including a closed scale using only letters from A to G, each letter representing a class and each class corresponding to energy savings, in seven different colours from dark green to red, in order to inform customers about energy efficiency and energy consumption; it includes rescaled labels and labels with fewer classes and colours in accordance with Article 11(10) and (11);
rescaling: an exercise making the requirements for achieving the energy class on a label for a particular product group more stringent;
rescaled label: a label for a particular product group that has undergone rescaling and is distinguishable from labels before rescaling while preserving a visual and perceptible coherence of all labels;
product information sheet: a standard document containing information relating to a product, in printed or electronic form;
technical documentation: documentation sufficient to enable market surveillance authorities to assess the accuracy of the label and the product information sheet of a product, including test reports or similar technical evidence;
supplementary information: information, as specified in a delegated act, on the functional and environmental performance of a product;
product database: a collection of data concerning products, which is arranged in a systematic manner and consists of a consumer-oriented public part, where information concerning individual product parameters is accessible by electronic means, an online portal for accessibility and a compliance part, with clearly specified accessibility and security requirements;
verification tolerance: the maximum admissible deviation of the measurement and calculation results of the verification tests performed by, or on behalf of, market surveillance authorities, compared to the values of the declared or published parameters, reflecting deviation arising from interlaboratory variation.
The supplier shall ensure that products that are placed on the market are accompanied, for each individual unit, free of charge, with accurate printed labels and with product information sheets in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant delegated acts.
The supplier shall deliver printed labels, including rescaled labels in accordance with Article 11(13), and product information sheets, to the dealer free of charge, promptly and in any event within five working days upon the dealer’s request.
Once a unit of a model is in service, the supplier shall request explicit consent from the customer regarding any changes intended to be introduced to the unit by means of updates that would be detrimental to the parameters of the energy efficiency label for that unit, as set out in the relevant delegated act. The supplier shall inform the customer of the objective of the update and of the changes in the parameters, including any change in the label class. For a period proportionate to the average lifespan of the product, the supplier shall give the customer the option of refusing the update without avoidable loss of functionality.
The supplier shall not place on the market products that have been designed so that a model’s performance is automatically altered in test conditions with the objective of reaching a more favourable level for any of the parameters specified in the relevant delegated act or included in any of the documentation provided with the product.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) and the house price index (HPI) at EU and national levels.
It replaces Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, which established a common framework for setting up harmonised indices of consumer prices.
The regulation takes into account the Commission's better regulation agenda and, in particular, the Commission communication of 8 October 2010 entitled Smart regulation in the European Union. In the statistical field, the Commission has set as a priority the simplification and improvement of the regulatory environment in statistics, as referred to in the Commission communication of 10 August 2009 on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) and the house price index (HPI) at EU and national levels.
The HICP is designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across EU countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in the EU.
Harmonised indices are used in the context of the Commission's macroeconomic imbalance procedure, as established by Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Price statistics of high quality and comparability are essential for those responsible for public policy in the EU, researchers and all European citizens.
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) uses the HICP as an index in order to measure the achievement of the ESCB's price stability objective under Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which is of particular relevance for the definition and implementation of the monetary policy of the EU under Article 127(2) TFEU. Pursuant to Articles 127(4) and 282(5) TFEU, the ECB is to be consulted on any proposed EU act in its fields of competence.

Summary 23:
Dumped imports from non-EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1036/2016 — protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union
Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 — protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIMS OF THE REGULATION?
              
It codifies Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 which aims to ensure that dumped imports from countries outside the EU are not given unfair market advantages.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation defines ‘dumped imports’ as imports from non-EU countries which are sold at prices below those which prevail in the exporting country or, in the absence of such prices, in a third country.
The regulation provides that an anti-dumping duty may be imposed on any dumped product which causes injury to the domestic industry in the EU.
The regulation provides for the determination of dumping and of injury. In particular, the normal value shall normally be based on the prices paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, by independent customers in the exporting country.
The regulation provides for the termination of investigations or proceedings where the dumping is de minimis or the injury is negligible, and it specifies the method of calculating the level of measures in cases of sampling.
The regulation provides for the acceptance of undertakings which eliminate dumping and injury instead of imposing provisional or definitive duties. It also provides for the suspension of anti-dumping measures where there is a temporary change in market conditions which makes the continued imposition of such measures temporarily inappropriate.
The regulation provides for the termination of cases, irrespective of whether definitive measures are adopted or not, normally within 12 months, and in no case more than 15 months, of the initiation of the investigation.
The regulation provides for the imposition of provisional duties in cases where there is a danger of serious injury to the domestic industry, or where a threat of serious injury to the domestic industry is evident.
The regulation provides for the imposition of definitive duties in cases where injury is caused to the domestic industry.
The regulation provides for the reassessment of export prices and dumping margins where the duty is being absorbed by the exporter through a form of compensatory arrangement and the measures are not being reflected in the prices of the products subject to measures in the EU.
The regulation provides for the circumvention of anti-dumping measures in cases where practices, including mere assembly of goods in the EU or a third country, have as their main aim the circumvention of anti-dumping measures.
The regulation provides for the suspension of measures in cases where there is a temporary change in market conditions which makes the continued imposition of such measures temporarily inappropriate.

Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility
Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility
The Recovery and Resilience Facility (the Facility) aims to help EU countries address the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis and increase their resilience to future crises. The Facility is part of the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) initiative, which provides € 750 billion of new EU funds to support EU countries’ recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. The Facility is one of the main pillars of the NGEU initiative.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which provides financial support to EU countries to implement reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The Facility supports reforms and investments in the following areas:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Regulation also sets out the rules for EU countries to prepare and implement their national recovery and resilience plans.
KEY POINTS
The Recovery and Resilience Facility provides financial support to EU countries to implement reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The Facility supports reforms and investments in the following areas:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Regulation also sets out the rules for EU countries to prepare and implement their national recovery and resilience plans.
Recovery and resilience plans
To access the Facility, EU countries must prepare a national recovery and resilience plan (RRP) that sets out their reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The RRP must be submitted to the Commission by 30 April 2021 at the latest.
EU countries may submit their draft RRP from 15 October 2020. The Commission assesses the RRP and informs the EU country of the outcome of that assessment. The Commission then adopts an implementing decision to approve or reject the RRP. The Council approves the Commission’s decision.
The Commission’s assessment is based on criteria set out in an annex to the Regulation. The assessment is based on 6 pillars:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Commission assesses the extent to which the RRP:
is relevant, effective, efficient and coherent;
contributes to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights;
contributes to the implementation of the European Green Deal;
contributes to the implementation of the Digital Single Market;
contributes to the implementation of the European Pillar of Structural Reform;
contributes to the implementation of the European Semester;
contributes to the implementation of the European Industrial Policy Strategy;
contributes to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.
The RRP must also include an explanation of how it contributes to effectively addressing the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester, including fiscal aspects and recommendations made pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester, as well as challenges and priorities identified in the most recent Council recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area for Member States whose currency is the euro.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with National Reform Programmes, National Energy and Climate Plans, just transition plans, the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and the partnership agreements and operational programmes adopted under the Union funds.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP sets out measures that are relevant for the green and digital transitions.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with the relevant objectives and priorities of the Multiannual Financial Framework.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP ensures that no measure for the implementation of reforms and investments included in that plan does significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the principle of ‘do no significant harm’).
The Commission assesses whether the RRP contains an explanation of the Member State’s plans, systems and concrete measures to prevent, detect and correct conflicts of interest, corruption and fraud, and to avoid double funding from the Facility and other Union programmes.

Technical Support Instrument
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Technical Support Instrument (TSI) as a continuation of the Structural Reform Support Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2017/825.
The TSI is designed to assist national authorities in their endeavours to design, develop and implement reforms.
The TSI is a key tool to support the implementation of reforms by the EU countries in the context of the European Green Deal, the digital transition and the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights.
KEY POINTS
WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DOES THE TSI PROVIDE?
The TSI provides technical support to EU countries in a broad range of policy domains, which include areas related to public financial and asset management, institutional and administrative reform, judicial reform, business environment, the financial sector and improvement of financial literacy, markets for products, services and labour, education and training, gender equality, sustainable development, public health, social welfare and care, as well as early detection and coordinated response capabilities. Specific emphasis is placed on actions that foster the green and digital transitions.
The TSI also supports the preparation for membership of the euro area.
WHEN DOES THE TSI START?
The TSI runs from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027. It has a budget of €864 million for the 7 years it is in force.
WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DOES THE TSI PROVIDE?
The TSI provides technical support to EU countries in a broad range of policy domains, which include areas related to public financial and asset management, institutional and administrative reform, judicial reform, business environment, the financial sector and improvement of financial literacy, markets for products, services and labour, education and training, gender equality, sustainable development, public health, social welfare and care, as well as early detection and coordinated response capabilities. Specific emphasis is placed on actions that foster the green and digital transitions.
The TSI also supports the preparation for membership of the euro area.
HOW DOES THE TSI WORK?
EU countries wishing to receive technical support under the TSI submit a request for technical support to the European Commission, identifying the policy areas and the priorities for support within the scope of the TSI.
The Commission analyses the request for support based on the urgency, breadth and depth of the challenges identified, support needs in respect of the policy areas concerned, analysis of socioeconomic indicators and institutional and general administrative capacity of the EU countries concerned.
Based on that analysis and taking into account the existing actions and measures financed by Union funds or other Union programmes, the Commission and the EU countries concerned agree on the priority areas for support, the objectives, an indicative timeline, the scope of the support measures to be provided and the estimated global financial contribution for such technical support, which is set out in a cooperation and support plan.
The cooperation and support plan identifies, separately from other technical support, the measures linked to the recovery and resilience plans pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/241.
The cooperation and support plan is published on the Commission’s website.
The Commission provides technical support to EU countries upon request, in order to support the implementation of reforms undertaken at the initiative of EU countries, reforms in the context of economic governance processes, in particular those effectively addressing the country-specific recommendations or actions related to the implementation of Union law, and reforms in relation to the implementation of economic adjustment programmes.
The Commission establishes a work programme for the implementation of technical support. It may grant technical support in the form of grants, procurement, prizes and indirect implementation.
The Commission provides an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Regulation.

Regulation (EU) 2019/26 — type-approval of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
Regulation (EU) 2019/26 complements Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 by establishing special provisions for the EU type-approval and the placing on the market of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which have been type-approved by the type-approval authority of the United Kingdom (‘UK type-approval authority’) while the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) of this Regulation still applies to and in the United Kingdom.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units type-approved by the United Kingdom, in accordance with Union legislation, can continue to be placed on the Union market after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which fall within the scope of Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and their types which have been approved by the UK type-approval authority on the basis of those acts or any regulatory act of the Union listed in Annex IV to Directive 2007/46/EC or any regulatory act repealed by those regulatory acts of the Union.
The regulation defines the following:
‘Union type-approval authority’ means a type-approval authority of a Member State other than the United Kingdom;
‘UK type-approval’ means an EC type-approval or EU type-approval granted by the UK type-approval authority;
‘Union type-approval’ means an EU type-approval granted by a Union type-approval authority in accordance with this Regulation.
Manufacturers holding a UK type-approval that has not become invalid pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2007/46/EC, Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 may, until the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) of this Regulation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom, submit an application to a Union type-approval authority for a Union type-approval of the same type.
In order to be approved, the type must comply with the requirements for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units applicable at the time when the Union type-approval takes effect.
The Union type-approval authority which has received an application in accordance with Article 4 of this Regulation may grant a Union type-approval with respect to a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit if the type in question meets, at the time when the Union type-approval takes effect, the requirements applicable for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.
The Union type-approval shall take effect on the day of its granting or on a later date determined therein. The UK type-approval shall become invalid on the day preceding the day on which the Union type-approval takes effect. In any event, it shall become invalid at the latest on the day on which the Union type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.
A Union type-approval shall be considered to be an EC type-approval or an EU type-approval within the meaning of Directive 2007/46/EC or any act listed in Annex IV to that Directive, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. All provisions of those acts not derogated from in this Regulation shall continue to apply. The Union type-approval authority shall take full responsibility for the obligations stemming from the Union type-approval.
The type approved in accordance with this Article shall receive an EU type-approval certificate with a number consisting of the distinguishing number of the Member State whose type-approval authority granted the Union type-approval and of the number of the applicable act referred to in Article 2(1). It shall also include the number of the latest amending act containing requirements for type-approval in accordance with which the Union type-approval is granted.
When applying for a Union type-approval under Article 4, a manufacturer shall also request the Union type-approval authority in question to take over the obligations of the UK type-approval authority with respect to the manufacturer's other vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union on the basis of UK type-approvals that have either become invalid pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2007/46/EC, Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, or for which no Union type-approval is sought under this Regulation.

Summary 36:
European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE)
The European Commission has proposed the establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak. This instrument aims at addressing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and respond to its socio-economic consequences.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the ‘Instrument’).
The Instrument aims at complementing national measures taken by affected Member States by providing financial assistance to help those Member States cope with the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure intended to mitigate the direct economic, social and health-related effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
KEY POINTS
The Instrument provides financial assistance to a Member State which is experiencing, or is seriously threatened with, a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak for the financing, primarily, of short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the self-employed and thus reducing the incidence of unemployment and loss of income, as well as for the financing, as an ancillary, of some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace.
The maximum amount of financial assistance under the Instrument is EUR 100 billion for all Member States.
A Member State may request Union financial assistance under the Instrument (‘financial assistance’) where its actual and possibly also planned public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased as of 1 February 2020 due to national measures directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures to address the socio-economic effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The financial assistance takes the form of a loan granted by the Union to the Member State concerned.
The Commission shall consult the Member State concerned without undue delay to verify the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures, as well as, where appropriate, to relevant health-related measures, in the Member State requesting financial assistance which are linked to the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Commission shall be empowered to borrow on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the Union at the most appropriate time so as to optimise the cost of funding and preserve its reputation as the Union’s issuer in the markets.
The Commission shall establish the necessary arrangements for the administration of the loans with the European Central Bank.
The Commission shall conclude an agreement with a contributing Member State on the irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand guarantees provided by Member States.
The loan granted under the Instrument shall be disbursed in instalments.
The Instrument shall only become available after all Member States have contributed to the Instrument in accordance with Article 11 for an amount representing at least 25 % of the maximum amount referred to in Article 5, provided that the relative shares of contributions of each Member State of the overall amount of Member States’ contributions correspond to the relative shares of Member States in the total gross national income of the Union.
The Commission shall inform the Council when the Instrument becomes available.
The period of availability of the Instrument during which a decision referred to in Article 6(1) may be adopted shall end on 31 December 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties
Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It sets up a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
              
CCPs are essential to the smooth functioning of the EU financial markets. They are responsible for clearing and settling the trades of their members. They also manage the risks of their members’ trades and ensure that the financial obligations of their members are fulfilled.
In the event of CCP failure, the regulation sets up a framework for the recovery and resolution of CCPs.
The regulation applies to CCPs that are authorised in the EU.
The regulation complements Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which provides for uniform prudential requirements applicable to CCPs.
Competent authorities and resolution authorities
Competent authorities and resolution authorities are designated by the Member States. The authorities must work together in supervisory and resolution colleges to ensure that they can cooperate and coordinate effectively.
The regulation lays down common conditions for the exercise of recovery and resolution powers by the authorities. It also establishes common objectives for the resolution of CCPs.
Recovery
Competent authorities must ensure that CCPs develop and maintain recovery plans that enable them to restore their viability in the event of financial distress. The authorities must also ensure that CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The recovery plan must cover a broad range of scenarios, including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both. The plan must also include comprehensive arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The plan must be reviewed and updated at least once a year.
The authorities must assess the plan to ensure that it is comprehensive and that it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner.
The plan must be non-discriminatory and balanced in terms of its impact and the incentives it creates. The effects of the recovery measures on clearing members and, where applicable, their clients and on the financial system of the EU or of one or more of its Member States more broadly must be proportionate.
The plan must be submitted to the competent authorities, which must then assess whether the plan is comprehensive and whether it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner. The authorities must ensure that the CCP implements the plan.
Resolution
The authorities must ensure that CCPs develop and maintain resolution plans that enable them to maintain the continuity of critical functions and to protect the financial stability of the EU and of its Member States.
The authorities must ensure that the CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The resolution plan must cover a broad range of scenarios, including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both.
The plan must be reviewed and updated at least once a year.
The authorities must assess the plan to ensure that it is comprehensive and that it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner.
The plan must be non-discriminatory and balanced in terms of its impact and the incentives it creates. The effects of the resolution measures on clearing members and, where applicable, their clients and on the financial system of the EU or of one or more of its Member States more broadly must be proportionate.
The plan must be submitted to the competent authorities, which must then assess whether the plan is comprehensive and whether it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner. The authorities must ensure that the CCP implements the plan.
The authorities must ensure that the CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
Early intervention
Competent authorities must be able to take early intervention measures to remedy the deterioration of a CCP’s financial and economic situation before it reaches a point at which authorities have no other alternative but to resolve it or to direct the CCP to change its recovery measures where they could be detrimental for overall financial stability.
Early intervention measures include the power to restrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default, and also the power to restrict, prohibit or freeze any payments of variable remuneration as defined by the CCP’s remuneration policy pursuant to Article 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, discretionary pension benefits or severance packages to senior management.
Conditions for resolution
A CCP may be considered to be failing or likely to fail when it infringes or is likely in the near future to infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation, when its recovery has failed or is likely to fail to restore its viability, when the CCP is unable or is likely to be unable to provide a critical function, when the assets of the CCP are or are likely in the near future to be less than its liabilities, when the CCP is or is likely in the near future to be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due, or when the CCP requires extraordinary public financial support.
The fact that a CCP does not comply with all the requirements for authorisation should not justify by itself the entry into resolution.
Emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank, where such a facility is available, should not be a condition that demonstrates that a CCP is or will be, in the near future, unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. In order to preserve financial stability, in particular in the case of a systemic liquidity shortage, State guarantees on liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger entry into resolution, provided that a number of conditions are met.
Resolution powers
The resolution authority has a broad range of powers at its disposal to ensure the continuity of critical functions of a CCP that is failing or likely to fail.
The powers include the ability to:
restructure the assets and liabilities of the CCP;
sell, transfer or liquidate the assets of the CCP;
appoint a manager to manage the CCP’s affairs;
designate an entity to carry out the critical functions of the CCP;
transfer the rights and obligations of the CCP to another entity;
restructure or terminate the CCP’s contracts;
convert the CCP’s equity into debt;
write-down, write-up or exchange the CCP’s equity;
cancel or modify the CCP’s contracts;
exercise rights and powers over the CCP’s property;

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
The decision aims to encourage and support the efforts of the EU, EU countries, regional and local authorities, and other organisations to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail.
KEY POINTS
The year 2021 shall be designated as the European Year of Rail (the ‘European Year’).
The general objective of the European Year shall be to encourage and support the efforts of the EU, EU countries, regional and local authorities, and other organisations to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail. The specific objectives of the European Year shall be to:
promote rail as a sustainable, innovative, interconnected and intermodal, safe and affordable mode of transport, in particular by highlighting the role of rail:
as a game changer helping to achieve the EU’s climate neutrality objective by 2050;
as a pillar of an efficient logistic network, capable of guaranteeing essential services, even during unexpected crises; and
as a transport mode that reaches out to the wider public, especially the young, inter alia presenting rail as an attractive career opportunity;
highlight the European, cross-border dimension of rail, that brings citizens closer together, allows them to explore the EU in all its diversity, fosters socio-economic and territorial cohesion and contributes to integrating the EU internal market, in particular by ensuring better connectivity within and with its geographical periphery, including through regional cross-border connections;
enhance the contribution of rail to the EU’s economy, to its industry, including to its global competitiveness, to its commerce and to its society, in particular those aspects related to regional and local development, sustainable tourism, education, youth and culture, and to improving accessibility for persons with disabilities or persons with reduced mobility, and in particular paying attention to the needs of elderly people;
contribute to promoting rail as an important element in relations between the EU and its neighbouring countries, building on interests and needs in partner countries and on expertise in rail transport, both within and beyond the EU;
build on rail’s power to stimulate the collective imagination, particularly through rail’s history and its cultural heritage, recalling the contribution that rail has made to the creation of European prosperity and the role of the rail in developing cutting-edge technologies;
promote the attractiveness of the railway professions, in particular by highlighting the demand for new skills and the importance of fair and safe working conditions and of addressing the need to increase diversity in the workforce;

contribute to the implementation of the Fourth Railway Package and to raising awareness of the measures required to establish the single European railway area, based on a well-functioning TEN-T;
stimulate discussion on how to modernise rolling stock and on how to further develop and increase the capacity of railway infrastructure in order to facilitate the broader use of passenger and freight transport by rail, underlining in that context the importance of the cooperation among infrastructure managers, research and innovation and the role of the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking;
stimulate discussion on how to modernise rolling stock and on how to further develop and increase the capacity of railway infrastructure in order to facilitate the broader use of passenger and freight transport by rail, underlining in that context the importance of the cooperation among infrastructure managers, research and innovation and the role of the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking;
promote events and initiatives to disseminate information on the rights of rail passengers and to stimulate cooperation among all actors in order to improve customer information and ticketing, including the offer of through-tickets and developing innovative digital multi-modal tickets, as well as to provide information about current challenges in that respect, such as the need for data sharing among actors.
The measures to be taken to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2 shall be closely coordinated with on-going activities promoting rail transport. Those measures shall include the following activities at EU, national, regional or local level, organised in partnerships or individually, and linked to the objectives of the European Year:
initiatives and events to promote debate, build a positive image, raise awareness and facilitate the engagement of citizens, businesses and public authorities in order to increase trust in rail, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, and to promote the attractiveness of rail for the transport of more people and goods as a means of combating climate change, through multiple channels and tools, including events in EU countries, while also highlighting the safety and comfort of travelling by rail;
initiatives in EU countries to encourage, in both the public and private sector, business-travel and commuting patterns by rail;
informative exhibitions, inspirational, educational and awareness-raising campaigns, as well as the use of demonstration and information trains to encourage changes in passenger, consumer and business behaviour and to stimulate the general public to actively contribute to achieving the objectives of more sustainable transport;
sharing the experience and best practices of national, regional and local authorities, civil society, businesses and schools as regards promoting the use of rail and on how to implement behavioural change at all levels;
undertaking studies and innovative activities, and disseminating their results on a European or national scale;
promoting projects and networks related to the European Year, including via the media, social networks and other online communities;
partnerships and events such as those set out in the Annex;
identifying and promoting best practices to create a level-playing field for different modes of transport;
promoting projects and activities to raise awareness of sustainable end-to-end mobility that delivers seamless ‘door-to-door’ travel solutions in combination with other modes of transport, including active travel, and sustainable and smart logistics;
promoting projects and activities fostering awareness of the importance of the single European railway area, in particular as regards its on-going implementation, actions facilitating international railway journeys and actions for digital passenger information, such as those providing real-time information about journey offers, fares and timetables, including from independent providers, facilitating comparison; and
promoting projects and activities with a view to the realisation of an extended, modernised and interoperable railway infrastructure, including a European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), terminals offering modal shift options, as well as modernised rolling stock.
The Commission shall consider initiating, during the European Year:
a study on the feasibility of creating a European label to promote goods and products transported by rail so as to encourage businesses to switch their transport to rail; and
a feasibility study with a view to introducing a rail connectivity index, with the aim of categorising the level of integration achieved through the use of services on the rail network and showing the potential of rail to compete with other modes of transport.
The EU institutions and bodies, as well as EU countries, at EU and national level respectively, may refer to the European Year and make use of its visual identity in promoting the activities referred to in paragraph 1.
The organisation of participation in the European Year at national level is a responsibility of EU countries. They shall ensure the coordination of relevant activities at national level and shall appoint national contact persons to ensure coordination at EU level.

The regulation applies whenever treated urban waste water is reused, in accordance with Article 12(1) of Directive 91/271/EEC, for agricultural irrigation as specified in Annex I to the regulation.
A Member State may decide that it is not appropriate to reuse water for agricultural irrigation in one or more of its river basin districts or parts thereof, taking into account the following criteria:
the geographic and climatic conditions of the district or parts thereof;
the pressures on and the status of other water resources, including the quantitative status of groundwater bodies as referred to in Directive 2000/60/EC;
the pressures on and the status of the surface water bodies in which treated urban waste water is discharged;
the environmental and resource costs of reclaimed water and of other water resources.
Any decision taken pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be duly justified on the basis of the criteria referred to in that subparagraph and submitted to the Commission. It shall be reviewed as necessary, in particular taking into account climate change projections and national climate change adaptation strategies, and at least every 6 years taking into account river basin management plans established pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC.
The regulation applies without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 and does not preclude food business operators from obtaining the water quality required to comply with that regulation by using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options, or from using alternative water sources for agricultural irrigation.
Competent authorities
A competent authority is an authority or a body designated by a Member State to carry out its obligations under the regulation regarding the granting of permits for the production or supply of reclaimed water, regarding exemptions for research or pilot projects and regarding compliance checks.
Reclaimed water
Reclaimed water means urban waste water that has been treated in compliance with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC and which results from further treatment in a reclamation facility in accordance with Annex I to the regulation.
Reclamation facility
A reclamation facility is an urban waste water treatment plant or other facility that further treats urban waste water that complies with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC in order to produce water that is fit for a use specified in Annex I to the regulation.
Risk management
For the purpose of producing, supplying and using reclaimed water, the competent authority ensures that a water reuse risk management plan is established.
One water reuse risk management plan may cover one or more water reuse systems.
The water reuse risk management plan is prepared by the reclamation facility operator, other responsible parties and end-users, as appropriate.
The responsible party must ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is implemented.
Monitoring
The reclamation facility operator shall monitor water quality in accordance with the following:
Section 2 of Annex I;
any additional conditions set by the competent authority in the relevant permit pursuant to points (c) and (d) of Article 6(3), as regards monitoring.
Permits
A permit is a written authorisation issued by a competent authority to produce or supply reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation in accordance with the regulation.
The reclamation facility operator shall ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is implemented and that the reclaimed water complies with the conditions of the permit.
The reclamation facility operator shall notify the competent authority of any significant changes in the water reuse system, in particular, when the water reuse risk management plan is revised.
The competent authority shall verify the compliance of the reclaimed water with the conditions of the permit. If non-compliance is found, the competent authority shall require the responsible parties to take the necessary measures to ensure that the reclaimed water is in compliance. The supply of the reclaimed water shall be suspended where non-compliance causes a significant risk to the environment or to human or animal health.
The reclamation facility operator shall supply the reclaimed water in accordance with the conditions set out in the permit.
The competent authority shall ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is reviewed at least once every 5 years.

Summary 45:
Regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to lay down uniform technical and business requirements for card-based payment transactions carried out within the European Union (EU), where both the payer’s payment service provider and the payee’s payment service provider are located therein.
The regulation does not apply to services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet one of the following conditions:
instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer or within a limited network of service providers under direct commercial agreement with a professional issuer;
instruments which can be used only to acquire a very limited range of goods or services;
instruments valid only in a single EU country provided at the request of an undertaking or a public sector entity and regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services from suppliers having a commercial agreement with the issuer.
It does not apply to:
transactions with commercial cards;
cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines or at the counter of a payment service provider; and
transactions with payment cards issued by 3-party payment card schemes.
KEY POINTS
Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
The regulation prohibits interchange fees for card-based payment transactions between the payer’s payment service provider and the payee’s payment service provider.
However, the prohibition does not apply to transactions with commercial cards.
It does not apply to cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines or at the counter of a payment service provider and transactions with payment cards issued by 3-party payment card schemes.
Interchange fees for debit card transactions
The regulation does not prohibit interchange fees for domestic debit card transactions.
It does not apply to 3-party payment card schemes until 9 December 2018 in relation to domestic payment transactions, provided that the card-based payment transactions made in a Member State under such a 3-party payment card scheme do not exceed on a yearly basis 3 % of the value of all card-based payment transactions made in that Member State.
Interchange fees for credit card transactions
The regulation does not prohibit interchange fees for credit card transactions.
It does not apply to 3-party payment card schemes until 9 December 2018 in relation to domestic payment transactions, provided that the card-based payment transactions made in a Member State under such a 3-party payment card scheme do not exceed on a yearly basis 3 % of the value of all card-based payment transactions made in that Member State.
Separation of scheme and infrastructure
Payment card schemes and payment service providers must be independent in terms of accounting, organisation and decision-making process. They must not discriminate, for instance by providing each other with preferential treatment or privileged information which is not available to their competitors on their respective market segment, imposing excessive information requirements on their competitor in their respective market segment, cross-subsidising their respective activities or having shared governance arrangements.
‘Honour all cards’ rule
The ‘honour all cards’ rule is a twofold obligation imposed by issuers and payment card schemes for payees to accept all the cards of the same brand, irrespective of the different costs of these cards (the ‘honour all products’ element) and irrespective of the individual issuing bank which has issued the card (the ‘honour all issuers’ element).
It is in the interest of the consumer that for the same category of cards the payees cannot discriminate between issuers or cardholders, and payment card schemes and payment service providers can impose such an obligation on them. Therefore the ‘honour all issuers’ element of the ‘honour all cards’ rule is a justifiable rule within a payment card scheme, since it prevents payees from discriminating between individual banks which have issued a card.
The ‘honour all products’ element is essentially a tying practice that has the effect of tying acceptance of low fee cards to the acceptance of high fee cards. A removal of the ‘honour all products’ element of the ‘honour all cards’ rule would allow merchants to limit the choice of payment cards they offer to low(er) cost payment cards only, which would also benefit consumers through reduced merchants’ costs.
Merchants accepting debit cards would then not be forced to accept credit cards, and those accepting credit cards would not be forced to accept commercial cards.
However, to protect the consumer and the consumer’s ability to use the payment cards as often as possible, merchants must be obliged to accept cards that are subject to the same regulated interchange fee only if issued within the same brand and of the same category (prepaid card, debit card or credit card).
Clear distinction between consumer and commercial cards
Payees and payers must have the means to identify the different categories of cards. Therefore, the various brands and categories must be identifiable electronically and for newly issued card-based payment instruments visibly on the device.
In addition, the payer must be informed about the acceptance of the payer’s payment instrument(s) at a given point of sale.
The payer must also have the possibility to choose the payment application, and the payer’s payment instrument must not be blocked for the payer.
Steering of the payer by the payee
The payer must be free to steer the payer towards the use of a specific payment instrument.
Payment card schemes and payment service providers must not impose several restrictions on payees in this respect, examples of which include restrictions on the refusal by the payee of specific payment instruments for low amounts, on the provision of information to the payer on the fees incurred by the payee for specific payment instruments or limitation imposed on the payee of the number of tills in his or her shop which accept specific payment instruments.
Redress procedures
Member States must establish adequate and effective out-of-court complaint and redress procedures or take equivalent measures.

It applies from 8 December 2015.

Summary 46:
A new framework for skills and qualifications
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) is establishing a new framework to support the transparency and understanding of skills and qualifications acquired in formal, non-formal and informal settings, including through practical experiences, mobility and volunteering. The new framework is known as ‘Europass’.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish a new framework for the provision of better services for skills and qualifications (Europass).
It replaces Decision No 2241/2004/EC which established the first version of the Europass framework.
KEY POINTS
The new Europass framework consists of web-based tools and relevant available information, including information to support the European dimension of guidance provided through an online platform and supported by national services. It is targeted at:
individual end-users, such as learners, job seekers, workers and volunteers;
relevant stakeholders, such as education and training providers, guidance practitioners, employers, public employment services, social partners, youth work providers, youth organisations and policy makers.
The use of the Europass framework is voluntary and does not impose any obligations or confer any rights other than those defined in this decision.
The Europass framework provides, through an online platform, web-based tools for:
documenting and describing personal information in a variety of formats, including curriculum vitae (CV) templates;
documenting and describing skills and qualifications acquired through working and learning experiences, including through mobility and volunteering;
the assessment of skills and self-assessment of skills;
documenting the learning outcomes of qualifications, including the Europass supplement templates, as referred to in Article 5.
The Europass online platform provides available information or links to available information on the following topics:
learning opportunities;
qualifications and qualifications frameworks or systems;
opportunities for validation of non-formal and informal learning;
recognition practices and relevant legislation in different countries, including third countries;
services offering guidance for transnational learning mobility and career management;
skills intelligence as produced by relevant Union-level activities and agencies within their domains of competence;
information on skills and qualifications that could be relevant to the particular needs of third country nationals arriving or residing in the European Union (EU) to support their integration.
The Europass online platform and web-based tools, including their content and functionality, shall be user-friendly and secure and be made available free-of-charge to all users.
The Europass online platform and web-based tools, including their content and functionality, shall be accessible to persons with disabilities, in accordance with the accessibility requirements established in relevant EU law.
Europass web-based tools shall use open standards to be made available free of charge, for reuse by EU Member States and other stakeholders on a voluntary basis.
Europass web-based tools shall refer to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) in information on qualifications, descriptions of national education and training systems and other relevant topics, as appropriate and in line with national circumstances.
The Europass online platform may include an option for users to store personal data such as a personal profile. Union data protection law shall apply to the processing of such personal data.
Europass shall support authentication services for any digital documents or representations of information on skills and qualifications.
Europass web-based tools shall be delivered in the official languages of the institutions of the EU.
Europass web-based tools shall support and ensure technical interoperability and synergies with other relevant instruments and services offered at EU and, where appropriate, national levels.
The Europass supplements shall be issued, in accordance with templates, by the competent authorities or bodies. In particular, the order of each item in the templates shall be respected, to ensure ease of understanding and the provision of complete information.
The templates referred to in the previous paragraph shall be developed and, when necessary, revised by the European Commission, in close cooperation and consultation with the EU Member States and other stakeholders such as the Council of Europe and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation to ensure relevance and usability of the supplements.
The Europass supplements shall be issued free of charge and, where possible, in electronic form. Europass supplements shall be issued in the national language and, where possible, in another European language.
The European Commission shall manage the Europass online platform. In that regard the Commission shall:
ensure the availability and high quality of Union-level information or links to such available information as referred to in Article 3(2);
develop, test and, when necessary, update the Europass online platform, including open standards, in line with user needs and technological advancements as well as changes in labour markets and in the provision of education and training;
keep up to date with and incorporate, where relevant, the latest technological developments that can improve the accessibility of Europass for older persons and persons with disabilities;
ensure that any development or updating of the Europass online platform, including open standards, supports consistency of information and demonstrates clear added value;
ensure that any web-based tools, in particular tools for assessment and self-assessment, are fully tested and quality-assured; and
ensure the quality and monitor the effectiveness of the Europass online platform including web-based tools in line with user needs.

EU statistics on inland waterways transport
EU statistics on inland waterways transport
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It establishes common rules for the production of European statistics on inland waterways transport.
KEY POINTS
Inland waterways transport
Inland waterways are an important part of the EU’s transport networks and the promotion of inland waterways transport is one of the objectives of the common transport policy, both for reasons of economic efficiency and in order to reduce energy consumption and the environmental impact of transport.
Scope
This regulation applies only to EU countries in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 million tonnes. However, by way of derogation, this regulation also applies to EU countries which do not have international or transit inland waterways transport but in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1 million tonnes.
Inland waterways transport does not occur in all EU countries and, therefore, the effect of this regulation is limited to those EU countries where this mode of transport exists.
Definitions
For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions apply:
inland waterways transport: any movement of goods and/or passengers using inland waterways vessels which is undertaken wholly or partly in navigable inland waterways;
national inland waterways transport: inland waterways transport between two ports of a national territory irrespective of the nationality of the vessel;
international inland waterways transport: inland waterways transport between two ports located in different national territories;
transit inland waterways transport: inland waterways transport through a national territory between two ports both located in another national territory or national territories provided that in the total journey within the national territory there is no transshipment;
inland waterways traffic: any movement of a vessel on a given navigable inland waterway.
Data collection
EU countries shall transmit data relating to inland waterways transport on their national territory to the European Commission (Eurostat).
EU countries in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 million tonnes shall supply the data required under Article 4(1) of this regulation.
By way of derogation from the previous paragraph, EU countries which do not have international or transit inland waterways transport but in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1 million tonnes shall supply only the data required under Article 4(2).
Data shall be collected in accordance with the tables set out in Annexes I to V of this regulation.
Goods shall be classified in accordance with Annex VI.
Quality of data
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the methodological requirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the data produced. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.
EU countries shall take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the data transmitted.
The Commission (Eurostat) shall assess the quality of the data transmitted. EU countries shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) with a report containing such information and data as it may request in order to verify the quality of the data transmitted.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the detailed arrangements, structure, periodicity and comparability elements for the quality reports. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 7 December 2016.

Summary 48:
EU rail statistics
EU rail statistics
EU rail statistics provide information on the rail transport of goods and passengers in the EU. They are collected by EU countries and transmitted to the European Commission (Eurostat).
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at EU level.
KEY POINTS
The regulation covers all railways in the EU. Each EU country must report statistics relating to rail transport on its national territory.
EU countries may exclude from the scope of the regulation railway undertakings that:
operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours;
provide mainly local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways.
The regulation defines the following terms:
railway: a line of communication made up by rail exclusively for the use of railway vehicles;
railway vehicle: mobile equipment running exclusively on rails, moving either under its own power (tractive vehicles) or hauled by another vehicle (coaches, railcar trailers, vans and wagons);
railway undertaking: any public or private undertaking which provides services for the transport of goods and/or passengers by rail;
transport of goods by rail: the movement of goods using railway vehicles between the place of loading and the place of unloading;
transport of passengers by rail: the movement of passengers using railway vehicles between the place of embarkation and the place of disembarkation;
metro: an electric railway for the transport of passengers with the capacity for a heavy volume of traffic and characterised by exclusive rights-of-way, multi-car trains, high speed and rapid acceleration, sophisticated signalling as well as the absence of level crossings to allow a high frequency of trains and high platform load;
tram (streetcar): a passenger road vehicle designed to seat more than 9 persons (including the driver), which is connected to electric conductors or powered by diesel engine and which is rail-borne;
light rail: a railway for the transport of passengers that often uses electrically powered rail-borne cars operating singly or in short trains on fixed duo-rail lines.
The regulation specifies the data to be collected and the sources from which the data are obtained. EU countries must designate a public or private organisation to participate in collecting the data required by the regulation.
EU countries must transmit the statistics to Eurostat. The Commission must adopt implementing acts laying down the arrangements for the transmission of the statistics.
Eurostat must disseminate the statistics.
The regulation provides for quality evaluation of the data transmitted by the EU countries and for the evaluation of the quality of the statistical data by Eurostat.
The Commission must adopt implementing acts laying down the arrangements for the dissemination of the results.
By 31 December 2020 and every 4 years thereafter, the Commission, after consulting the European Statistical System Committee, must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the regulation and on future developments.
The regulation repeals Regulation (EC) No 91/2003.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 13 December 2016.

members of the armed forces travelling on NATO or Partnership for Peace business and holders of identification and movement orders provided for by the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces of 19 June 1951;
without prejudice to the requirements stemming from the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees of the Council of Europe signed at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959, recognised refugees and stateless persons and other persons who do not hold the nationality of any country who reside in the United Kingdom or in Ireland and are holders of a travel document issued by the United Kingdom or Ireland, which is recognised by the Member State concerned.
A Member State may provide for exceptions from the visa requirement provided for in Article 3 or from the exemption from the visa requirement provided for in Article 4 as regards:
holders of diplomatic passports, service/official passports or special passports;
civilian air and sea crew members in the performance of their duties;
civilian sea crew members, when they go ashore, who hold a seafarer’s identity document issued in accordance with the International Labour Organisation Conventions No 108 of 13 May 1958 or No 185 of 19 June 2003 or the International Maritime Organization Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic of 9 April 1965;

A Member State may exempt from the visa requirement provided for in Article 3:
a school pupil having the nationality of a third country listed in Annex I, who resides in a third country listed in Annex II or in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and who is travelling in the context of a school excursion as a member of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question;
recognised refugees and stateless persons if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in Annex II;
members of the armed forces travelling on NATO or Partnership for Peace business and holders of identification and movement orders provided for by the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces of 19 June 1951;

Summary 51:
EU law on combating money laundering by criminal law
SUMMARY
EU law on combating money laundering by criminal law
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to combat money laundering by means of criminal law, enabling more efficient and swifter cross-border cooperation between competent authorities.
KEY POINTS
The definition of criminal activities which constitute predicate offences for money laundering is sufficiently uniform in all EU countries. EU countries ensure that all offences that are punishable by a term of imprisonment as set out in this Directive are considered predicate offences for money laundering.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the following conduct, when committed intentionally, is punishable as a criminal offence:
the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such an activity to evade the legal consequences of that person’s action;
the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of, property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity;
the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing at the time of receipt, that such property was derived from criminal activity.
EU countries may take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in the previous paragraph is punishable as a criminal offence where the offender suspected or ought to have known that the property was derived from criminal activity.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that:
a prior or simultaneous conviction for the criminal activity from which the property was derived is not a prerequisite for a conviction for the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs;
a conviction for the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs is possible where it is established that the property was derived from a criminal activity, without it being necessary to establish all the factual elements or all circumstances relating to that criminal activity, including the identity of the perpetrator;
the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs extend to property derived from conduct that occurred on the territory of another EU country or of a third country, where that conduct would constitute a criminal activity had it occurred domestically.
EU countries may further require that the relevant conduct constitutes a criminal offence under the national law of the other EU country or of the third country where that conduct was committed, except where that conduct constitutes one of the offences referred to in points (a) to (e) and (h) of point (1) of Article 2 and as defined in the applicable EU law.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 is punishable as a criminal offence when committed by persons who committed, or were involved in, the criminal activity from which the property was derived.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 4 years.
EU countries may provide that, in relation to the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4, the following circumstances are to be regarded as aggravating circumstances:
the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation within the meaning of Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA; or
the offender is an obliged entity within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and has committed the offence in the exercise of their professional activities.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for any of the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 committed for their benefit by any person, acting either individually or as part of an organ of the legal person and having a leading position within the legal person, based on any of the following:
a power of representation of the legal person;
an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or
an authority to exercise control within the legal person.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in the previous paragraph has made possible the commission of any of the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person held liable pursuant to Article 7 is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, which shall include criminal or non-criminal fines and may include other sanctions, such as:
exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid;
temporary or permanent exclusion from access to public funding, including tender procedures, grants and concessions;
temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice of commercial activities;
placing under judicial supervision;
a judicial winding-up order;
temporary or permanent closure of establishments which have been used for committing the offence.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure, as appropriate, that their competent authorities freeze or confiscate, in accordance with Directive 2014/42/EU, the proceeds derived from and instrumentalities used or intended to be used in the commission or contribution to the commission of the offences as referred to in this Directive.
Each EU country takes the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 where:
the offence is committed in whole or in part on its territory;
the offender is one of its nationals.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that effective investigative tools, such as those used in combating organised crime or other serious crimes are available to the persons, units or services responsible for investigating or prosecuting the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
The Directive applies from 3 December 2020.

Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
The EU is implementing a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (EAM) that was recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
KEY POINTS
              
The objective of this Regulation is to ensure that the biomass of bluefin tuna in the EAM is at least 60% of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2022, with at least a 60% probability of achieving this objective.
This Regulation lays down the general rules for the application by the Union of the recovery plan, as defined in Article 3.
This Regulation applies to bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the EAM.
The recovery plan applies from 2007 to 2022.
The EU shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of its catching vessels and its traps are commensurate with the bluefin tuna fishing opportunities available to it in the EAM.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 31 January each year:
an annual fishing plan for the catching vessels and traps fishing bluefin tuna in the EAM;
an annual fishing capacity management plan ensuring that the Member State's fishing capacity is commensurate with its allocated quota.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 15 April each year an annual farming management plan if it intends to modify the ICCAT plan for farming capacity in force.
By 31 January each year, each Member State with a bluefin tuna quota shall transmit to the Commission:
an annual fishing plan for the catching vessels and traps fishing bluefin tuna in the EAM;
an annual fishing capacity management plan ensuring that the Member State's fishing capacity is commensurate with its allocated quota.
The Commission shall compile the plans transmitted by the Member States and integrate them into the Union fishing and capacity management plan. The Commission shall transmit that plan to the ICCAT Secretariat by 15 February of each year for discussion and approval by ICCAT.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 31 January each year an annual farming management plan if it intends to modify the ICCAT plan for farming capacity in force.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of its catching vessels and its traps are commensurate with the bluefin tuna fishing opportunities available to it in the EAM.
The maximum number of traps registered in a Member State and of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State that may fish for, retain on board, tranship, transport, or land bluefin tuna, shall be determined in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The maximum number and the corresponding gross tonnage of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State engaged in bluefin tuna fishery shall be limited to the number, and the total corresponding gross tonnage, of fishing vessels flying the flag of that Member State that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed bluefin tuna from 1 January 2007 to 1 July 2008. That limit shall apply by gear type for catching vessels.
The maximum number of traps of a Member State engaged in bluefin tuna fishery shall be limited to the number of traps authorised by that Member State by 1 July 2008.
The maximum bluefin tuna farming and fattening capacity for each Member State and the maximum input of wild-caught bluefin tuna that each Member State may allocate shall be determined in accordance with the TFEU and Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.

The EU introduces supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It seeks to prevent the financing of armed groups and security forces in resource-rich areas through trade in tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.
KEY POINTS
The regulation establishes a Union system for supply chain due diligence (‘Union system’) in order to curtail opportunities for armed groups and security forces to trade in tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold.
The regulation lays down the supply chain due diligence obligations of Union importers of minerals or metals containing or consisting of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold, as set out in Annex I.
The regulation shall not apply to Union importers of minerals or metals where their annual import volume of each of the minerals or metals concerned is below the volume thresholds set out in Annex I. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend Annex I by establishing and amending the volume thresholds of minerals and metals.
The regulation does not apply to recycled metals.
The regulation shall not apply to stocks where a Union importer demonstrates that those stocks were created in the current form on a verifiable date prior to 1 February 2013.
The regulation applies to minerals and metals referred to in Annex I that are obtained as by-products as defined in the regulation.
The regulation applies to minerals and metals referred to in Annex I that are obtained as by-products as defined in the regulation.
The regulation defines ‘conflict-affected and high-risk areas’ as areas in a state of armed conflict or fragile post-conflict as well as areas witnessing weak or non-existent governance and security, such as failed states, and widespread and systematic violations of international law, including human rights abuses.
The regulation defines ‘smelters and refiners’ as any natural or legal person performing forms of extractive metallurgy involving processing steps with the aim to produce a metal from a mineral.

The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/444 establishing the Customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs. The programme replaces the Customs 2020 programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1294/2013.
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE?
The Customs 2020 programme has been successful in improving the effectiveness of customs cooperation between the customs authorities of the Member States of the European Union (EU). It is therefore appropriate to establish a new Customs programme, which will continue to support the customs authorities and help them work together and act as one.
KEY POINTS
The programme supports the customs union and the customs authorities working together and acting as one to protect the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the EU and to protect the EU from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity.
The programme supports the following:
the preparation and uniform implementation of customs legislation and policy;
customs cooperation;
administrative and IT capacity building, including human competency and training, as well as the development and operation of electronic systems;
innovation in the area of customs policy.
The financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for the period 2021–2027 is €950 million in current prices. This amount may also cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It may also cover expenses linked to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions that are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme.
The programme is open to the participation of the following third countries:
acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union programmes established in the respective framework agreements and Association Council decisions, or in similar agreements and in accordance with the specific conditions laid down in agreements between the Union and those countries;
European Neighbourhood Policy countries, in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union programmes established in the respective framework agreements and Association Council decisions or in similar agreements and in accordance with the specific conditions laid down in agreements between the Union and those countries;
other third countries, in accordance with the conditions laid down in a specific agreement covering the participation of the third country to any Union programme, provided that the agreement:
ensures a fair balance as regards the contributions and benefits of the third country participating in the Union programmes;
lays down the conditions of participation in the programmes, including the calculation of financial contributions to individual programmes, and their administrative costs;
does not confer on the third country any decision-making power in respect of the Union programme;
guarantees the rights of the Union to ensure sound financial management and to protect its financial interests.
The programme shall be implemented under direct management in accordance with the Financial Regulation. It may provide funding in any of the forms laid out in the Financial Regulation, in particular by means of grants, prizes, procurement and the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by external experts.
Only actions implementing the objectives set out in Article 3 shall be eligible for funding. Actions complementing or supporting the actions implementing the objectives set out in the Customs Control Equipment Instrument Regulation shall also be eligible for funding under the programme.
The actions referred to in the previous paragraph shall include the following:
meetings and similar ad hoc events;
project-based structured collaboration, such as collaborative IT development by a group of Member States;
IT capacity-building actions, in particular the development and operation of electronic systems;
human-competency and other capacity-building actions, including training and exchange of best practices;
support actions and other actions, including:
studies;
innovation activities, in particular proof-of-concepts, pilot projects, prototyping initiatives, smart data mining and collaboration among systems;
jointly developed communication actions;
any other actions provided for in the work programmes referred to in Article 12, which are necessary for attaining, or are in support of, the objectives set out in Article 3.

European Solidarity Corps Programme
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/888 establishing the European Solidarity Corps Programme and repealing Regulations (EU) 2018/1475 and (EU) No 375/2014
WHAT IS THE REGULATION DOING?
              
It establishes the European Solidarity Corps Programme (the Programme), which is designed to open up new opportunities for young people to undertake volunteering activities in solidarity-related areas, as well as to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own initiative.
It repeals Regulations (EU) 2018/1475 and (EU) No 375/2014.
KEY POINTS
The Programme aims to provide young people with more and better opportunities for solidarity activities across the European Union (EU) and beyond.
The Programme is built on the strengths and synergies of previous and existing programmes, in particular the European Voluntary Service, established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013, and the EU Aid Volunteers initiative, established by Regulation (EU) No 375/2014.
The Programme is designed to open up new opportunities for young people to undertake volunteering activities in solidarity-related areas, as well as to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own initiative.
The Programme offers young people the opportunity to express their commitment to benefitting communities while acquiring useful experience, knowledge, skills and competences for their personal, educational, social, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability.
The Programme also supports networking activities for participants and participating organisations and measures to ensure the quality of the supported activities and to enhance the validation of the learning outcomes of participants.
The Programme provides a single entry point for solidarity activities throughout the EU and beyond.
The Programme is designed to respond to unmet societal needs and contribute to strengthening communities and civic participation. The Programme also aims to contribute to European cooperation relevant to young people and to raising awareness of its positive impact.
Solidarity activities offered to young people should allow for concrete and beneficial contributions of young people. Solidarity activities should respond to unmet societal needs and contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the EU humanitarian aid, in line with the Good Humanitarian Donorship principles.

European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) for the period of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.
It lays down the objectives of the EGF, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding, including applications by the Member States for financial contributions from the EGF for measures targeting the beneficiaries referred to in Article 6.
KEY POINTS
The EGF shall support socioeconomic transformations that are the result of globalisation and of technological and environmental changes by helping displaced workers and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased to adapt to structural change. The EGF shall constitute an emergency fund that operates reactively. As such, the EGF shall contribute to the implementation of the principles set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights and shall enhance social and economic cohesion among regions and Member States.
The objectives of the EGF are to demonstrate solidarity and promote decent and sustainable employment in the Union by offering assistance in the case of major restructuring events, in particular those caused by challenges related to globalisation, such as changes in world trade patterns, trade disputes, significant changes in the trade relations of the Union or the composition of the internal market and financial or economic crises, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy, or as a consequence of digitisation or automation. The EGF shall support beneficiaries in returning to decent and sustainable employment as soon as possible. Particular emphasis shall be placed on measures that help the most disadvantaged groups.
The EGF shall support workers who lose their jobs in large-scale restructuring events and to help them to find other jobs as quickly as possible. The Union shall continue to provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment of displaced workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets suffering a shock of serious economic disruption.
The EGF shall be mobilised in cases where a major restructuring event has a significant impact on the local or regional economy. Such an impact shall be determined by reference to a minimum number of job displacements within a specific reference period. Considering that waves of dismissals in different sectors within the same region have an equally significant impact on the local labour market, regional applications shall also be possible. In small labour markets, such as in small Member States or remote regions, including the outermost regions as referred in Article 349 TFEU, or in exceptional circumstances, it shall be possible for applications to be submitted in cases with a lower number of job displacements. In general, Member States shall not submit their applications for EGF assistance later than 12 weeks after the end of the reference period. However, in order to prevent a funding gap due to the fact that this Regulation will enter into force after 1 January 2021 and in order to provide legal certainty, that time limit shall be suspended between 1 January 2021 and the entry into force of this Regulation.
The EGF shall primarily direct financial contributions towards active labour market policy measures and personalised services that aim to reintegrate beneficiaries rapidly into decent and sustainable employment within or outside their initial sector of activity, while preparing them for a greener and more digital European economy. The support shall also seek to promote self-employment and enterprise creation, including through the establishment of cooperatives. Measures shall reflect the prospective needs of the local or regional labour market. However, where relevant, the mobility of displaced workers shall also be supported in order to help them find new employment elsewhere. There shall be a particular focus on the dissemination of skills required in the digital age and on overcoming gender stereotypes in employment, where appropriate. The inclusion of pecuniary allowances in coordinated packages of personalised services shall be restricted. The measures supported by the EGF shall not replace passive social protection measures. Employers could be encouraged to participate in the national co-funding for the EGF-supported measures in addition to the measures which they are required to provide by virtue of national law or collective agreements.
The EGF shall be mobilised in cases where a major restructuring event has a significant impact on the local or regional economy. Such an impact shall be determined by reference to a minimum number of job displacements within a specific reference period.

Summary 66:
effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
The euro area countries have a particular interest in and a responsibility to conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union and to avoid policies that jeopardise that functioning.
The euro area countries have a particular interest in and a responsibility to conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union and to avoid policies that jeopardise that functioning.
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area which go beyond the provisions applicable to all EU countries, for the purpose of ensuring the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union.

Experience gained and mistakes made during the first decade of the economic and monetary union show a need for improved economic governance in the EU, which should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework at the level of the EU for the surveillance of national economic policies.
Experience gained and mistakes made during the first decade of the economic and monetary union show a need for improved economic governance in the EU, which should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework at the level of the EU for the surveillance of national economic policies.
The improved economic governance framework should rely on several interlinked and coherent policies for sustainable growth and jobs, in particular a Union strategy for growth and jobs, with particular focus on developing and strengthening the internal market, fostering international trade and competitiveness, a European Semester for strengthened coordination of economic and budgetary policies, an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive government deficits (the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)), a robust framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks, and enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, including macroprudential supervision by the European Systemic Risk Board.

EU rules on the internal market for electricity
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It sets out rules for the EU's internal electricity market, which was established in 1996. The aim of this market is to deliver real choice for all EU citizens, new business opportunities, competitive prices, efficient investment signals and higher standards of service, as well as security of supply and sustainability.
KEY POINTS
The internal electricity market
The internal electricity market is based on the principles of free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. These freedoms are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers.
The internal market is governed by common rules for the production, supply and distribution of electricity.
The market rules allow for the entry and exit of producers and suppliers based on their assessment of the economic and financial viability of their operations.
Member States retain the right to impose public service obligations in the general economic interest, in accordance with Article 106 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular where supply is severely constrained, causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal, or in the event of a market failure where interventions by regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven to be ineffective.
Member States must ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electricity as regards market entry, operation and exit.
The internal market is supported by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG).
Access to the market
The internal market for electricity has been progressively implemented throughout the EU since 1999. It is organised through a competitive electricity market across country borders.
The EU’s energy system is in the middle of a profound change. The common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants. Technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation. There is a need to adapt the EU market rules to a new market reality.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, in pursuit of the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement.
It sets a binding target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030.
KEY POINTS
Climate neutrality
The EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals regulated in EU law must be balanced within the EU by 2050, thus reducing emissions to net zero by that date, and the EU shall aim to achieve negative emissions thereafter.
The relevant EU institutions and the EU Member States must take the necessary measures at EU and national level, respectively, to enable the collective achievement of the climate-neutrality objective set out in the regulation, taking into account the importance of promoting both fairness and solidarity among Member States and cost-effectiveness in achieving this objective.
Scientific advice on climate change
The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (the Advisory Board) established under Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 serves as a point of reference for the EU on scientific knowledge relating to climate change by virtue of its independence and scientific and technical expertise.
The Advisory Board provides scientific advice and issues reports on existing and proposed EU measures, climate targets and indicative greenhouse gas budgets, and their coherence with the objectives of the regulation and the EU’s international commitments under the Paris Agreement.
The Advisory Board identifies actions and opportunities needed to successfully achieve the EU climate targets and raises awareness on climate change and its impacts, as well as stimulating dialogue and cooperation between scientific bodies within the EU.
The Advisory Board is guided in its work by the best available and most recent scientific evidence, including the latest reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
EU 2030 climate target

The SIA 2021-2027 sets out the EIT’s priority fields and strategy for the period from 2021 to 2027 (SIA 2021-2027). It establishes the EIT’s key actions, mode of operation, expected results and impact, as well as an estimate of the financial needs and sources for the future activities of the EIT. The SIA 2021-2027 ensures the necessary consistency of the EIT with Horizon Europe.
The SIA 2021-2027 is informed by an impact assessment carried out by the Commission. It takes into account the draft SIA prepared by the EIT and submitted to the Commission on 20 December 2017, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 294/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). It also reflects Regulation (EU) 2021/695, and, in particular, the key role of the EIT as part of Pillar III ‘Innovative Europe’ of Horizon Europe, and its contribution to addressing global and societal challenges, including established targets and commitments to climate objectives and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to Pillar I ‘Excellent Science’ and Pillar II ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’ of Horizon Europe.

A multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish and the deletion of certain provisions from Regulation (EU) 2017/2107
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1154 on a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a multiannual recovery plan for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Mediterranean Sea (‘Mediterranean swordfish’).
It amends Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
KEY POINTS
Subject matter and scope
The regulation applies to:
Union fishing vessels, and Union vessels engaged in recreational fishing, which:
catch Mediterranean swordfish;
tranship or carry on board, including outside the ICCAT Convention area, Mediterranean swordfish;
third country fishing vessels, and third country vessels engaged in recreational fisheries, which operate in Union waters and which catch Mediterranean swordfish;
third country vessels which are inspected in Member States ports and which carry on board Mediterranean swordfish or fishery products originating from Mediterranean swordfish that have not been previously landed or transhipped at ports.
Management measures
Each Member State takes the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of fishing vessels flying its flag is commensurate with the fishing opportunities for Mediterranean swordfish available to that Member State.
Each Member State allocates fishing opportunities for Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
Member States limit the number of fishing vessels flying their flag and authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish to the average yearly number of vessels flying their flag that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed Mediterranean swordfish during the period 2013-2016.
Each Member State submits its annual fishing plans to the Commission by 1 March of each year. Such annual fishing plans shall include detailed information regarding the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated by fishing gear type, including quota allocated to recreational fisheries, where relevant, and to by-catches.
Technical conservation measures
Mediterranean swordfish shall not be caught, either as targeted species or as by-catch, retained on board, transhipped or landed during the closure period. The closure period shall be from 1 January to 31 March of each year.
By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it shall be prohibited to catch, retain on board, tranship, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale Mediterranean swordfish, including in recreational fisheries:
measuring less than 100 cm lower jaw to fork length (LJFL); or
weighing less than 11,4 kg of live weight, or 10,2 kg of gilled and gutted weight.
Only entire specimens of Mediterranean swordfish, without removal of any external part, or gilled and gutted specimens, may be retained on board, transhipped landed or carried in the first transport after landing.
Notwithstanding Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish may retain on board, tranship, transfer, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale incidental catches of Mediterranean swordfish below the minimum conservation reference size, provided such catches do not exceed 5 % by weight or number of specimens of the total Mediterranean swordfish catch of the fishing vessels concerned.
By-catches of Mediterranean swordfish shall not exceed at any time following a fishing operation the by-catch limit that Member States establish in their annual fishing plans for the total catch on board by weight or number of specimens.
Where the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated to the flag Member State is exhausted, any Mediterranean swordfish caught alive shall be released.
The maximum number of hooks that may be set by or carried on board fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish shall be fixed at 2 500 hooks.
The hook size shall not be smaller than 7 cm in height.
The length of the pelagic longlines shall not exceed 30 nautical miles (55,56 km).
Control measures
Member States shall issue fishing authorisations to fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish and flying their flag, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, in particular Articles 20 and 21 thereof.
Only Union vessels included in the ICCAT record of vessels, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 16 and 17, shall be allowed to target, retain on board, tranship, land, transport or process Mediterranean swordfish, without prejudice to the provisions on by-catches laid down in Article 13.
Each Member State with a quota for Mediterranean swordfish shall implement a national scientific observer programme for pelagic longline vessels flying that Member State's flag and targeting Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with this Article. The national observer programme shall comply with the minimum standards laid down in Annex I.

Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making
SUMMARY
INTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT
The European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission have agreed to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
Better law-making
The three institutions hereby agree to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
Programming
The three institutions agree to reinforce the Union's annual and multiannual programming in line with Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which entrusts the Commission with the task of initiating annual and multiannual programming.
The Commission will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council respectively, both before and after the adoption of its annual Work Programme. That dialogue will encompass the following:
early bilateral exchanges of views on initiatives for the upcoming year will take place in advance of the submission of a written contribution from the President of the Commission and its First Vice-President setting out in appropriate detail items of major political importance for the following year and containing indications with regard to intended withdrawals of Commission proposals;
following the debate on the State of the Union, and before the adoption of the Commission Work Programme, the European Parliament and the Council will have an exchange of views with the Commission on the basis of the letter of intent;
an exchange of views will take place between the three institutions on the adopted Commission Work Programme, pursuant to paragraph 7.
The Commission will duly take account of the views expressed by the European Parliament and the Council at each stage of the dialogue, including their requests for initiatives.
The Commission will provide regular updates on its planning throughout the year and give reasons for any delay in the presentation of the proposals included in its Work Programme. The Commission will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of its Work Programme for the year in question.
Impact assessment
The three institutions agree on the positive contribution of impact assessments in improving the quality of Union legislation.
The Commission will carry out impact assessments of its legislative and non-legislative initiatives, delegated acts and implementing measures which are expected to have significant economic, environmental or social impacts.
The Commission's impact assessment and any additional impact assessment work conducted during the legislative process by the Institutions will be made public by the end of the legislative process and, taken together, can be used as the basis for evaluation.
Public and stakeholder consultation and feedback
The Commission will, before adopting a proposal, conduct public consultations in an open and transparent way, ensuring that the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation.
Ex-post evaluation of existing legislation
The three institutions confirm the importance of the greatest possible consistency and coherence in organising their work to evaluate the performance of Union legislation, including related public and stakeholder consultations.
The Commission will inform the European Parliament and the Council of its multiannual planning of evaluations of existing legislation and will, to the extent possible, include in that planning their requests for in-depth evaluation of specific policy areas or legal acts.
Legislative instruments
The Commission shall provide, in relation to each proposal, an explanation and justification to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding its choice of legal basis and type of legal act in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal.
The Commission shall also explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in the light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and how they are compatible with fundamental rights.
Delegated and implementing acts
The three institutions underline the important role played by delegated and implementing acts in Union law. Used in an efficient, transparent manner and in justified cases, they are an integral tool for better law-making, contributing to simple, up-to-date legislation and its efficient, swift implementation. It is the competence of the legislator to decide whether and to what extent to use delegated or implementing acts, within the limits of the Treaties.
The three institutions have agreed on a Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and on the related standard clauses (the Common Understanding), annexed hereto. In accordance with the Common Understanding and with a view to enhancing transparency and consultation, the Commission commits to gathering, prior to the adoption of delegated acts, all necessary expertise, including through the consultation of Member States' experts and through public consultations.
The Commission may be invited to meetings in the European Parliament or the Council in order to have a further exchange of views on the preparation of delegated acts.
The three institutions will enter into negotiations without undue delay after the entry into force of this Agreement, with a view to supplementing the Common Understanding by providing for non-binding criteria for the application of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The three institutions agree to refrain from adding, in Union legislation, procedural requirements which would alter the mechanisms for control set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Transparency and coordination of the legislative process
The three institutions acknowledge that the ordinary legislative procedure has developed on the basis of regular contacts at all stages of the procedure. They remain committed to further improving the work done under the ordinary legislative procedure in line with the principles of sincere cooperation, transparency, accountability and efficiency.
The three institutions will keep each other regularly informed throughout the legislative process about their work, about on-going negotiations among them and about any stakeholder feedback that they may receive, via appropriate procedures, including dialogue between them.
The three institutions will facilitate mutual exchange of views and information, including by inviting representatives of the other institutions to informal exchanges of views on a regular basis.
The three institutions agree that the provision of information to national Parliaments must allow the latter to exercise fully their prerogatives under the Treaties.
The three institutions will ensure the transparency of legislative procedures, on the basis of relevant legislation and case-law, including an appropriate handling of trilateral negotiations.
The three institutions undertake to meet within six months after the entry into force of this Agreement in order to negotiate improved practical arrangements for cooperation and information-sharing within the framework of the Treaties, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Implementation and application of Union legislation
The three institutions call upon the Member States, when they adopt measures to transpose or implement Union legislation or to ensure the implementation of the Union budget, to communicate clearly to their public on those measures.
The three institutions call upon the Member States to cooperate with the Commission in obtaining information and data needed to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Union law.
The Commission will continue to report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Union legislation. The Commission's report includes, where relevant, reference to the information mentioned in paragraph 43. The Commission may provide further information on the state of implementation of a given legal act.
Simplification
The three institutions confirm their commitment to using the legislative technique of recasting for the modification of existing legislation more frequently and in full respect of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts. Where recasting is not appropriate, the Commission will submit a proposal in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 –Accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts as soon as possible after the adoption of an amending act. If the Commission does not submit such a proposal, it shall state

Citizens' Initiative
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 on the citizens' initiative
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the procedures and conditions required for a citizens’ initiative as provided for in Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 24 TFEU.
KEY POINTS
Subject matter
The regulation establishes the procedures and conditions required for a citizens’ initiative as provided for in Article 11 TFEU and Article 24 TFEU.
Definitions
‘Citizens’ initiative’ means an initiative submitted to the European Commission in accordance with this Regulation, inviting the Commission, within the framework of its powers, to submit any appropriate proposal on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties, which has received the support of at least one million eligible signatories coming from at least one quarter of all Member States.
‘Signatories’ means citizens of the Union who have supported a given citizens’ initiative by completing a statement of support form for that initiative.
‘Organisers’ means natural persons forming a citizens’ committee responsible for the preparation of a citizens’ initiative and its submission to the Commission.
Requirements for organisers and for signatories
The organisers must be citizens of the Union and be of the age to be entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament.
The organisers must form a citizens’ committee of at least seven persons who are residents of at least seven different Member States. The organisers must designate one representative and one substitute (‘the contact persons’) who will liaise between the citizens’ committee and the institutions of the Union throughout the procedure and who will be mandated to speak and act on behalf of the citizens’ committee.
For the purpose of registering a proposed citizens’ initiative in accordance with Article 4, only the information concerning the seven members of the citizens’ committee who are needed in order to comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and in this paragraph will be considered by the Commission.
The Commission may request the organisers to provide appropriate proof that the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 are fulfilled.
In order to be eligible to support a proposed citizens’ initiative, signatories must be citizens of the Union and must be of the age to be entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament.
Registration of a proposed citizens’ initiative
Before initiating the collection of statements of support from signatories for a proposed citizens’ initiative, the organisers must register it with the Commission, providing the information set out in Annex II, in particular on the subject matter and objectives of the proposed citizens’ initiative.
That information must be provided in one of the official languages of the Union, in an online register made available for that purpose by the Commission (‘the register’).
After the registration is confirmed in accordance with paragraph 2, the organisers may provide the proposed citizens’ initiative in other official languages of the Union for inclusion in the register. The translation of the proposed citizens’ initiative into other official languages of the Union shall be the responsibility of the organisers.
The Commission must establish a point of contact which provides information and assistance.
Within two months from the receipt of the information set out in Annex II, the Commission must register a proposed citizens’ initiative under a unique registration number and send a confirmation to the organisers, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:
the citizens’ committee has been formed and the contact persons have been designated in accordance with Article 3(2);
the proposed citizens’ initiative does not manifestly fall outside the framework of the Commission’s powers to submit a proposal for a legal act of the Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties;
the proposed citizens’ initiative is not manifestly abusive, frivolous or vexatious; and
the proposed citizens’ initiative is not manifestly contrary to the values of the Union as set out in Article 2 TFEU.
The Commission must refuse the registration if the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 are not met.
A proposed citizens’ initiative that has been registered must be made public in the register. Without prejudice to their rights under Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, data subjects must be entitled to request the removal of their personal data from the register after the expiry of a period of two years from the date of registration of a proposed citizens’ initiative.
At any time before the submission of statements of support in accordance with Article 8, the organisers may withdraw a proposed citizens’ initiative that has been registered. In that case, an indication to that effect must be entered in the register.
Procedures and conditions for the collection of statements of support
The organisers must be responsible for the collection of the statements of support from signatories for a proposed citizens’ initiative which has been registered in accordance with Article 4.
Only forms which comply with the models set out in Annex III and which are in one of the language versions included in the register for that proposed citizens’ initiative may be used for the collection of statements of support. The organisers must complete the forms as indicated in Annex III prior to initiating the collection of statements of support from signatories.
The organisers may collect statements of support in paper form or electronically. Where statements of support are collected online, Article 6 must apply.
Signatories must be required to complete statement of support forms made available by the organisers. They must indicate only the personal data that are required for the purposes of verification by the Member States, as set out in Annex III.
Signatories may only support a given proposed citizens’ initiative once.
Member States must forward to the Commission any changes to the information set out in Annex III. Taking account of those changes, the Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 and subject to the conditions of Articles 18 and 19, amendments to Annex III.
All statements of support must be collected after the date of registration of the proposed citizens’ initiative and within a period not exceeding 12 months.
At the end of that period, the register must indicate that the period has expired and, where appropriate, that the required number of statements of support was not collected.
Online collection systems
Where statements of support are collected online, the data obtained through the online collection system must be stored in the territory of a Member State.
The online collection system must be certified in accordance with paragraph 3 in the Member State in which the data collected through the online collection system will be stored. The organisers may use one online collection system for the purpose of collecting statements of support in several or all Member States.
The models for the statement of support forms may be adapted for the purpose of the online collection.
The organisers must ensure that the online collection system used for the collection of statements of support complies with paragraph 4.
Prior to initiating the collection of statements of support, the organisers must request the competent authority of the relevant Member State to certify that the online collection system used for that purpose complies with paragraph 4.
The organisers may only start collecting statements of support through the online collection system once they have obtained the certificate referred to in paragraph 3. The organisers must make a copy of that certificate publicly available on the website used for the online collection system.
By 1 January 2012, the Commission must set up and thereafter must maintain open-source software incorporating the relevant technical and security features necessary for compliance with the provisions of this Regulation

Placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC
SUMMARY
—  This Regulation lays down rules for the authorisation of plant protection products in commercial form and for their placing on the market, use and control within the Community.
—  It lays down both rules for the approval of active substances, safeners and synergists, which plant protection products contain or consist of, and rules for adjuvants and co-formulants.
—  The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment and to improve the functioning of the internal market through the harmonisation of the rules on the placing on the market of plant protection products, while improving agricultural production.
—  The provisions of this Regulation are underpinned by the precautionary principle in order to ensure that active substances or products placed on the market do not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.
—  This Regulation applies to products, in the form in which they are supplied to the user, consisting of or containing active substances, safeners or synergists, and intended for one of the following uses:
—  protecting plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene rather than for the protection of plants or plant products;
—  influencing the life processes of plants, such as substances influencing their growth, other than as a nutrient;
—  preserving plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special Community provisions on preservatives;
—  destroying undesired plants or parts of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants;
—  checking or preventing undesired growth of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants.
These products are referred to as ‘plant protection products’.
—  This Regulation applies to substances, including micro-organisms having general or specific action against harmful organisms or on plants, parts of plants or plant products, referred to as ‘active substances’.
—  This Regulation applies to the following:
—  substances or preparations which are added to a plant protection product to eliminate or reduce phytotoxic effects of the plant protection product on certain plants, referred to as ‘safeners’;

EU fishing measures in the Mediterranean and Black Seas
EU fishing measures in the Mediterranean and Black Seas
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) Agreement area and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the application by the EU of conservation, management, exploitation, monitoring, marketing and enforcement measures for fishery and aquaculture products established by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM).
It replaces Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, which was repealed by Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all commercial fishing and aquaculture activities conducted by EU fishing vessels and nationals of EU Member States in the GFCM Agreement area.
By way of derogation from the regulation, it does not apply to fishing operations conducted solely for the purpose of scientific investigations which are carried out with the permission and under the authority of the Member State whose flag the vessel is flying and of which the Commission and the Member States in whose waters the research is carried out have been informed in advance.
The regulation defines the GFCM Agreement area as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and connecting waters, as described in the GFCM Agreement.
It sets out a number of technical measures:
Fisheries restricted areas
In the eastern Gulf of Lions, fishing effort of vessels using towed nets, bottom- and mid-water longlines and bottom-set nets in the fisheries restricted area is not to exceed the level of fishing effort applied in 2008 by each Member State in that area.
Before 1 February 2012, Member States are to submit to the Commission in electronic format a list of vessels flying their flag that had a track record of fishing during the year 2008 in the area referred to in Article 4 and in GFCM Geographical Sub-Area 7 as defined in Annex I. The list is to contain the name of the vessel, its EU Fleet Register number, the period for which the vessel was authorised to fish in the area referred to in Article 4 and the number of days spent by each vessel in the year 2008 in Geographical Sub-Area 7 and more specifically in the area referred to in Article 4.
Vessels authorised to fish in the area referred to in Article 4 are issued with a fishing authorisation by their Member State in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Fishing vessels which do not have records of fishing within the area referred to in Article 4 prior to 31 December 2008 shall not be authorised to start fishing therein.
Member States are to ensure that the area referred to in Article 4 is protected from the impact of any other human activity jeopardising the conservation of the features that characterise that area as an area of spawners’ aggregation.
Fishing effort
For demersal stocks, the fishing effort of vessels using towed dredges and bottom trawl nets in the following areas is prohibited:
the ‘Lophelia reef off Capo Santa Maria di Leuca’ (deep-sea fisheries restricted area);
the ‘The Nile delta area cold hydrocarbon seeps’ (deep-sea fisheries restricted area);
the ‘The Eratosthenes Seamount’ (deep-sea fisheries restricted area).
Member States are to ensure that their competent authorities are called upon to protect the deep-sea sensitive habitats in the areas referred to in Article 10 from, in particular, the impact of any other activity jeopardising the conservation of the features that characterise those habitats.
Closed season for the dolphinfish fisheries using fish aggregating devices
The common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) fisheries using fish aggregating devices (FADs) are prohibited from 1 January to 14 August of each year.
By way of derogation from the above, if a Member State can demonstrate that, due to bad weather, the fishing vessels flying its flag were unable to make use of their normal fishing days, that Member State may carry over days lost by its vessels in FAD fisheries until 31 January of the following year. In that case, before the end of the year Member States are to submit to the Commission an application in respect of the number of days to be carried over.
The application is to contain the following information:
a report containing the details of the cessation of fishing activities in question, including appropriate supporting meteorological information;
the name of the vessel and its EU Fleet Register number.
The Commission is to decide on applications of the kind referred to in paragraph 2 within 6 weeks from the date of receipt of an application and is to inform the Member State in writing of that decision.
The Commission is to inform the Executive Secretary of the GFCM of decisions taken pursuant to paragraph 5. Before 1 November of each year, Member States are to send to the Commission a report on the carrying over of days lost in the previous year as referred to in paragraph 2.
The Commission may adopt implementing acts as regards detailed rules for the format and transmission of the applications referred to in paragraph 4 and of the report on such carrying over referred to in paragraph 6. Those implementing acts are to be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
Fishing vessels authorised to participate in the common dolphinfish fishery are to be granted a fishing authorisation in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and are to be included in a list containing the name of the vessel and its EU Fleet Register number, which the Member State concerned is to provide to the Commission. Vessels of an overall length of less than 10 metres are to be required to have a fishing authorisation.
Member States are to set up an appropriate system of collection and treatment of fisheries catch and fishing effort data.
Member States are to report to the Commission by 15 January of each year the number of vessels involved in the fishery, as well as the total landings and transhipments of common dolphinfish carried out in the previous year by the fishing vessels flying their flag in each Geographical Sub-Area of the GFCM Agreement area as set out in Annex I.
Fishing gear
The minimum mesh size for nets used for trawling activities exploiting demersal stocks in the Black Sea is 40 mm. Panels of netting smaller than 40 mm mesh size opening are not to be used or kept on board.
Before 1 February 2012, the net referred to in the above is to be replaced by a square-meshed net of 40 mm at the cod-end or, at the duly justified request of the ship-owner, by a diamond meshed net of 50 mm with an acknowledged size selectivity equivalent to or higher than that of square-meshed nets of 40 mm at the cod-end.
Member States whose fishing vessels conduct trawling activities exploiting demersal stocks in the Black Sea are to submit to the Commission, for the first time not later than 16 February 2012 and subsequently every 6 months, the list of

Regulation (EU) No 20/2013 on the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
Regulation (EU) No 20/2013 establishes the rules for the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America on the other.
WHAT HARM DOES THIS REGULATION ADDRESS?
It aims to ensure the effective application of the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America on the other.
KEY POINTS
The regulation establishes the rules for the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America on the other.
The regulation also establishes a number of rules for the application of the safeguard measures.
The Commission shall monitor the evolution of import statistics of bananas from Central American countries.
The Commission shall present an annual monitoring report to the European Parliament and to the Council on updated statistics on imports from Central American countries of bananas and those sectors to which monitoring has been extended.
The Commission may consider extending the scope of the monitoring to other sectors upon a duly justified request by the industries concerned.
The Commission shall monitor the observance by Central American countries of the social and environmental standards laid down in Title VIII of Part IV of the Agreement.
The Commission shall initiate proceedings upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission's own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to in Article 5(5), to justify such initiation.
The Commission shall seek all information it considers necessary to make a determination with regard to the conditions set out in Article 2(1), and, shall, where appropriate, endeavour to verify that information.
The Commission shall adopt prior surveillance measures in regard to imports from a Central American country where:
the trend in imports of a product is such that it could lead to one of the situations referred to in Articles 2 and 4; or
there is a surge of imports of bananas concentrated in one or several Member States, or in one or several of the Union's outermost regions.
The Commission may adopt provisional safeguard measures in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination on the basis of the factors referred to in Article 5(5) that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty in accordance with the Tariff Elimination Schedule, and such imports cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the Union industry.
The Commission may adopt prior surveillance measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(2).
The Commission shall adopt provisional safeguard measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(2). In cases of imperative grounds of urgency, including the case referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable provisional safeguard measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(4).

This Regulation establishes rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to establish specific rules for the surveillance of the sea borders by border guards operating under the coordination of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.
KEY POINTS
The Regulation applies to border surveillance operations carried out by Member States at their external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.
The Regulation establishes rules for border surveillance operations at sea and for the coordination of border surveillance operations by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.
In order to ensure the safety of persons intercepted or rescued, the measures taken for the purpose of a border surveillance operation shall be conducted in a way that, in all instances, ensures the safety of the persons intercepted or rescued, the safety of the participating units or that of third parties.
No person shall, in contravention of the principle of non-refoulement, be disembarked in, forced to enter, conducted to or otherwise handed over to the authorities of a country where, inter alia, there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or from which there is a serious risk of an expulsion, removal or extradition to another country in contravention of the principle of non-refoulement.
The participating units shall, in the performance of their duties, fully respect human dignity.
Upon detection, the participating units shall approach a vessel suspected of carrying persons circumventing or intending to circumvent checks at border crossing points or of being engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea in order to observe its identity and nationality and, pending further measures, shall survey that vessel at a prudent distance taking all due precautions.
The participating units shall collect and immediately report information about that vessel to the International Coordination Centre, including, where possible, information about the situation of persons on board, in particular whether there is an imminent risk to their lives or whether there are persons in urgent need of medical assistance.
The International Coordination Centre shall transmit that information to the National Coordination Centre of the host Member State.
The participating units shall collect and report information about any vessel suspected of being engaged in illegal activities at sea, which are outside the scope of the sea operation, to the International Coordination Centre, which shall transmit that information to the National Coordination Centre of the Member State concerned.
In the territorial sea of the host Member State or a neighbouring participating Member State, that State shall authorise the participating units to take one or more of the following measures where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel may be carrying persons intending to circumvent checks at border crossing points or is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea:
requesting information and documentation on ownership, registration and elements relating to the voyage of the vessel, and on the identity, nationality and other relevant data on persons on board, including whether there are persons in urgent need of medical assistance, and making persons on board aware that they may not be authorised to cross the border;
stopping, boarding and searching the vessel, its cargo and persons on board, and questioning persons on board and informing them that persons directing the vessel may face penalties for facilitating the voyage.
If evidence confirming that suspicion is found, that host Member State or neighbouring participating Member State may authorise the participating units to take one or more of the following measures:
seizing the vessel and apprehending persons on board;
ordering the vessel to alter its course outside of or towards a destination other than the territorial sea or the contiguous zone, including escorting the vessel or steaming nearby until it is confirmed that the vessel is keeping to that given course;
conducting the vessel or persons on board to the coastal Member State in accordance with the operational plan.
Any measure taken in accordance on the Regulation shall be proportionate and shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Regulation.
For the purposes of the Regulation, the host Member State shall instruct the participating unit appropriately through the International Coordination Centre.
The participating units shall collect and immediately report information about that vessel to the International Coordination Centre, including, where possible, information about the situation of persons on board, in particular whether there is an imminent risk to their lives or whether there are persons in urgent need of medical assistance.
The International Coordination Centre shall transmit that information to the National Coordination Centre of the host Member State.
The participating units shall collect and report information about any vessel suspected of being engaged in illegal activities at sea, which are outside the scope of the sea operation, to the International Coordination Centre, which shall transmit that information to the National Coordination Centre of the Member State concerned.
On the high seas, where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea, the participating units shall take one or more of the following measures, subject to the authorisation of the flag State, in accordance with the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants, and where relevant, national and international law:
requesting information and documentation on ownership, registration and elements relating to the voyage of the vessel, and on the identity, nationality and other relevant data on persons on board, including whether there are persons in urgent need of medical assistance;
stopping, boarding and searching the vessel, its cargo and persons on board, and questioning persons on board and informing them that persons directing the vessel may face penalties for facilitating the voyage.
If evidence confirming that suspicion is found, the participating units may take one or more of the following measures, subject to the authorisation of the flag State, in accordance with the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants, and where relevant, national and international law:
seizing the vessel and apprehending persons on board;
warning and ordering the vessel not to enter the territorial sea or the contiguous zone, and, where necessary, requesting the vessel to alter its course towards a destination other than the territorial sea or the contiguous zone;
conducting the vessel or persons on board to a third country or otherwise handing over the vessel or persons on board to the authorities of a third country;
conducting the vessel or persons on board to the host Member State or to a neighbouring participating Member State.
Any measure taken in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 shall be proportionate and shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Regulation.
For the purposes of the Regulation, the host Member State shall instruct the participating unit appropriately through the International Coordination Centre.
Where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a stateless vessel is carrying persons intending to circumvent the checks at border crossing points or is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea, the host

Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 on certain measures for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a legal framework for the adoption of certain measures by the European Commission in relation to the fisheries-related activities and policies of third countries in order to ensure the long-term conservation of stocks of common interest to the Union and those third countries.
KEY POINTS
WHAT STOCKS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IN AN UNSUSTAINABLE STATE?
Fish stocks are considered to be in an unsustainable state when they are not continuously maintained at or above the levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield or, if these levels cannot be estimated, when the stocks are not continuously maintained within safe biological limits.
WHAT MEASURES MAY BE ADOPTED?
The Commission may adopt the following measures in respect of a country allowing non-sustainable fishing:
identifying that country as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing;
identifying, where necessary, the specific vessels or fleets of that country to which certain measures are to apply;
imposing quantitative restrictions on importations of fish from the stock of common interest that have been caught under the control of that country and on importations of fishery products made of or containing such fish;
imposing quantitative restrictions on importations of fish of any associated species, and fishery products made of or containing such fish, when caught while conducting fisheries on the stock of common interest under the control of that country;
imposing restrictions on the use of Union ports by vessels flying the flag of that country that fish the stock of common interest and/or associated species and by vessels transporting fish and fishery products stemming from the stock of common interest and/or associated species that have been caught either by vessels flying the flag of that country or by vessels authorised by it while flying another flag;
prohibiting the purchase by Union economic operators of a fishing vessel flying the flag of that country;
prohibiting the reflagging of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State to the flag of that country;
prohibiting Member States from authorising the conclusion of chartering agreements whereby Union economic operators charter their vessels to economic operators of that country;
prohibiting the exportation to that country of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State or of fishing equipment and supplies needed to fish on the stock of common interest;
prohibiting the conclusion of private trade arrangements between Union economic operators and that country that enable a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State to use fishing opportunities of that country;
prohibiting joint fishing operations involving fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State and fishing vessels flying the flag of that country.
The Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the end of application of measures taken pursuant to this Regulation, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
WHEN MAY MEASURES BE ADOPTED?
The Commission may adopt the above-mentioned measures where:
a country fails to cooperate in the management of a stock of common interest in full compliance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO);
it fails to adopt necessary fishery management measures;
it adopts fishery management measures without due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other countries and the Union, and those fishery management measures, when considered in conjunction with measures taken by other countries and the Union, lead to fishing activities which could result in the stock being in an unsustainable state.
The Commission shall notify the country concerned of the intention to identify it as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing. That notification shall include information on the reasons for the identification of that country as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing and shall describe the possible measures that may be taken in relation to it pursuant to this Regulation.
The Commission shall provide the country concerned with a reasonable opportunity to respond to the notification in writing and to remedy the situation within one month of receiving that notification.
The Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the end of application of measures taken pursuant to this Regulation, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

Firearms — export authorisation, import and transit measures
Firearms — export authorisation, import and transit measures
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 258/2012 — implementing Article 10 of the United Nations’ Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes rules on export authorisation, import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, in order to implement Article 10 of the United Nations’ Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol).
KEY POINTS
Firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition
The regulation applies to firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition listed in Annex I. It does not apply to:
state-to-state transactions or state transfers;
firearms specially designed for military use and, in any case, firearms of the fully automatic firing type;
firearms destined for the armed forces, the police, or the public authorities of the EU;
collectors and bodies concerned with cultural and historical aspects of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition and recognised as such by the EU country in whose territory they are established, provided that tracing measures are ensured;
deactivated firearms;
antique firearms and their replicas as defined in accordance with national legislation, provided that antique firearms do not include firearms manufactured after 1899.
Export authorisation
An export authorisation established in accordance with the form set out in Annex II is required for the export of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition listed in Annex I. Such authorisation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the EU country where the exporter is established and shall be issued in writing or by electronic means.
Simplified procedures for the temporary export or the re-export of firearms, their parts, essential components and ammunition shall apply as follows:
no export authorisation shall be required for the temporary export by hunters or sport shooters as part of their accompanied personal effects, during a journey to a third country, provided that they substantiate to the competent authorities the reasons for the journey, in particular by producing an invitation or other proof of the hunting or sport shooting activities in the third country of destination, of:
one or more firearms,
their essential components, if marked, as well as parts,
their related ammunition, limited to a maximum of 800 rounds for hunters and a maximum of 1 200 rounds for sport shooters;
the re-export by hunters or sport shooters as part of their accompanied personal effects following temporary admission for hunting or sport shooting activities, provided that the firearms remain the property of a person established outside the customs territory of the EU and the firearms are re-exported to that person.
In deciding whether to grant an export authorisation under this Regulation, EU countries shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where appropriate:
their obligations and commitments as parties to the relevant international export control arrangements or relevant international treaties;
considerations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP;
considerations as to intended end use, consignee, identified final recipient and the risk of diversion.
When assessing an application for an export authorisation, EU countries shall take into account the application by the exporter of proportionate and adequate means and procedures to ensure compliance with the provisions and objectives of this Regulation and with the terms and conditions of the authorisation.
EU countries shall, in case of suspicion, request the importing third country to confirm receipt of the dispatched shipment of firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition.
Import and transit measures
The regulation also establishes import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition.
The exporter shall supply the competent authority of the EU country responsible for issuing the export authorisation with the necessary documents proving that the importing third country has authorised the import and that the third country of transit had no objection to the transit.
The period of validity of an export authorisation shall not exceed the period of validity of the import authorisation. Where the import authorisation does not specify a period of validity, except under exceptional circumstances and for duly justified reasons, the period of validity of an export authorisation shall be at least 9 months.
The regulation does not prevent the EU countries from applying their constitutional rules relating to public access to official documents, taking into account Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 5 April 2012.

Eurodac — fingerprint database for the EU
Eurodac — fingerprint database for the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 on the establishment of ‘Eurodac’ for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person and on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes, and amending Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish a system for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin Regulation).
It also lays down the conditions under which EU countries’ designated authorities and the European Police Office (Europol) may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes.
KEY POINTS
Eurodac
Eurodac is a computerised central fingerprint database (Central System) composed of:
a Central Unit,
a Business Continuity Plan and System.
The Central System is linked to each EU country’s National Access Point by a communication infrastructure that provides an encrypted virtual network dedicated to Eurodac data.
Each EU country has a single National Access Point.
The rules governing Eurodac apply to operations carried out by the EU countries as from the transmission of data to the Central System until use is made of the results of the comparison.
The procedure for taking fingerprints is determined and applied in accordance with the national practice of the EU country concerned and in accordance with the national legislation.
The Central System consists of 2 databases:
a fingerprint database;
a supplementary fingerprint database.
The fingerprint database contains the fingerprint data of:
applicants for international protection;
persons apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border of an EU country;
persons who have applied for international protection in another EU country;
persons who have been granted international protection in an EU country;
persons who have been granted refugee status or who have been granted subsidiary protection in an EU country;
persons who have been granted a residence permit in an EU country;
persons who have been granted citizenship of an EU country.
The supplementary fingerprint database contains the fingerprint data of:
persons who have been convicted of a criminal offence in an EU country;
persons who have been convicted of a criminal offence in a non-EU country.
Data on persons covered by Articles 9(1), 14(1) and 17(1) (see Summary of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013) which are processed in the Central System shall be processed on behalf of the EU country of origin under the conditions set out in this Regulation and separated by appropriate technical means.
National Access Point
The National Access Point is a designated national system which communicates with the Central System.
Designated authorities
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes.
The designated authorities are:
the authorities responsible for examining applications for international protection and for implementing the Dublin Regulation;
the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences.
The designated authorities are responsible for ensuring, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access as established in this Regulation.
The designated authorities are not allowed to request a comparison of fingerprint data for law enforcement purposes when the conditions for access are not met.
Requests for comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes must be reasoned.
Requests for comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes must be made through the National Access Point and the verifying authority.
The verifying authority must ensure, in an independent manner, strict compliance with the conditions for access as established in this Regulation before forwarding the request through the National Access Point to the Central System.
The designated authorities and the verifying authority may be part of the same organisation, if permitted under national law, but the verifying authority must act independently when performing its tasks under this Regulation.
Conditions for access
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes in specific cases and under strict conditions.
The conditions for access are:
the data subject is at least 14 years of age;
there are reasonable grounds for believing that the data subject has committed a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence;
the data subject has been the victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence;
the request for comparison is connected to a specific and concrete situation or to a specific and concrete danger associated with a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence, or to specific persons in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that they will commit or have committed any such offence;
the request for comparison is connected to a person who is the victim of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes only on condition that comparisons with the national fingerprint databases of the Member State and with the automated fingerprinting identification systems of all other Member States under Decision 2008/615/JHA did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject.
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes only on condition that the request for comparison is connected to a specific and concrete situation or to a specific and concrete danger associated with a terrorist offence or of other serious criminal offence, or to specific persons in respect of whom there are serious grounds for believing that they will commit or have committed any such offence.
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes only on condition that the request for comparison is connected to a person who is the victim of a terrorist offence or of other serious criminal offence.
The designated authorities of the EU countries may request the comparison of fingerprint data with those stored in the Central System for law enforcement purposes only on condition that the data subject is not a minor.

REGULATION (EC) No 300/2008 ON COMMON RULES IN THE FIELD OF CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out common rules and common basic standards on aviation security. It also establishes mechanisms for monitoring compliance.
KEY POINTS
The common basic standards for safeguarding civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference that jeopardise the security of civil aviation are set out in the Annex to the Regulation.
These standards may be supplemented by general measures designed to amend non-essential elements of the common basic standards.
Detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards and the general measures may include:
requirements and procedures for screening;
a list of prohibited articles;
requirements and procedures for access control;
requirements and procedures for the examination of vehicles, aircraft security checks and aircraft security searches;
decisions to recognise the equivalence of security standards applied in a third country;
requirements and procedures for security controls of air carrier mail and air carrier materials;
as regards in-flight supplies and airport supplies, procedures for the approval or designation of, and the obligations to be fulfilled by, regulated suppliers and known suppliers;
definition of critical parts of security restricted areas;
staff recruitment and training requirements;
special security procedures or exemptions from security controls;
technical specifications and procedures for approval and use of security equipment;
requirements and procedures concerning potentially disruptive passengers.
The Commission may adopt general measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of the common basic standards by supplementing them, in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
The Commission may also adopt detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards in accordance with the regulatory procedure.
The Commission may set criteria to allow Member States to derogate from the common basic standards and to adopt alternative security measures that provide an adequate level of protection on the basis of a local risk assessment.
Each Member State must draw up, apply and maintain a national civil aviation security programme.
Every airport operator, air carrier and entity applying aviation security standards must draw up, apply and maintain a security programme in order to comply both with this Regulation and with whichever national civil aviation security programme is applicable.
Every airport operator must draw up, apply and maintain an airport security programme.
Every air carrier must draw up, apply and maintain an air carrier security programme.

False and Authentic Documents Online (FADO) system
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It establishes the False and Authentic Documents Online (FADO) system containing information on authentic documents issued by EU countries, the European Union and third countries, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law, and on false versions thereof.
The purpose of the FADO system is to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by sharing information on the security features of, and potential fraud characteristics in, authentic and false documents between the Member State authorities competent in the area of document fraud.
The purpose of the FADO system is also to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by sharing information with other actors, including the general public.
KEY POINTS
Scope and content of the FADO system
The FADO system contains information on travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licences and vehicle licences issued by EU countries or the European Union, and on false versions thereof.
The FADO system may contain information on documents as referred to in the first subparagraph issued by third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law, and on false versions thereof.
The FADO system may contain information on other related official documents, in particular those used in support of applications for official documents, issued by EU countries and, where applicable, third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law, and on false versions thereof.
The following information is included in the FADO system:
information, including images, on authentic documents, and specimens thereof, and their security features;
information, including images, on false documents, whether forged, counterfeit or pseudo documents, and their fraud characteristics;
summaries of forgery techniques;
summaries of the security features of authentic documents; and
statistics on detected false documents.
The FADO system may also contain handbooks, contact lists, information on valid travel documents and their recognition by EU countries, recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of falsification and other useful related information.
Responsibilities of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the ‘Agency’)
The Agency is responsible for ensuring the proper and reliable functioning of the FADO system and providing support to the competent Member State authorities in the detection of false documents.
The Agency is also responsible for entering in the FADO system in a timely and efficient manner the information obtained and guaranteeing the uniformity and quality of that information.
Access to the FADO system
The architecture of the FADO system provides users with different levels of access to information.
The following actors may obtain access to information stored in the FADO system in a limited manner:
EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, other than those referred to in point 2;
third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;
private entities, such as airlines and other carriers.
The European Commission adopts delegated acts in accordance with Article 8 supplementing this Regulation by establishing measures granting access to information stored in the FADO system to the actors listed in the previous paragraph. The delegated acts set out for the actors listed in the previous paragraph the part of the FADO system to which access is to be granted and any specific procedures and conditions that may be necessary, including the requirement to conclude an agreement between the Agency and a third party or a private entity as referred to in points 2 and 3.

Multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks
Multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/973 — establishing a multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, specifying details of the implementation of the landing obligation in the North Sea and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 676/2007 and (EC) No 1342/2008
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, and specifies details of the implementation of the landing obligation in the North Sea.
The plan aims to:
contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP), in particular by applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management;
ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY);
eliminate discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches;
implement the landing obligation established in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/201/3 for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which the regulation applies;
implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised;
ensure that the conditions described in descriptor 3 contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC are fulfilled;
contribute to the fulfilment of other relevant descriptors contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC in proportion to the role played by fisheries in their fulfilment.
KEY POINTS
The plan covers the following demersal stocks in the North Sea and their fisheries exploiting those stocks:
cod (Gadus morhua);
haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus);
plaice (Pleuronectes platessa);
saith (Pollachius virens);
sole (Solea solea);
whiting (Merlangius merlangus);
anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius);
Northern Prawn (Pandalus borealis);
Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus);
Norway lobster in the following functional units:
Botney Gut-Silver Pit (Functional Unit 5);
Farn Deeps (Functional Unit 6);
Fladen Ground (Functional Unit 7);
Firth of Forth (Functional Unit 8);
Moray Firth (Functional Unit 9);
Noup (Functional Unit 10);
Norwegian Deeps (Functional Unit 32);
Horn's Reef (Functional Unit 33);
Devil's Hole (Functional Unit 34).
The geographical scope of the plan is based on the geographical distribution of stocks indicated in the latest scientific stock advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). However, the Commission may adopt delegated acts to adjust the geographical distribution of stocks set out in the plan if the scientific advice provided by ICES indicates a change in the geographical distribution of the relevant stocks.
The plan also applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.
The plan specifies details for the implementation of the landing obligation in Union waters of the North Sea for all stocks of species to which the landing obligation applies under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The plan also applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.
The plan aims to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). It specifies that the target fishing mortality (F), in line with the ranges of FMSY defined in the plan, shall be achieved as soon as possible, and on a progressive, incremental basis by 2020 for the stocks listed in the plan, and shall be maintained thereafter within the ranges of FMSY.
The plan also aims to ensure that the conditions described in descriptor 3 contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC are fulfilled and to contribute to the fulfilment of other relevant descriptors contained in Annex I to Directive 2002008/56/EC in proportion to the role played by fisheries in their fulfilment.
The plan aims to eliminate discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to implement the landing obligation established in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which the regulation applies.
The plan implements the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised. It shall be coherent with Union environmental legislation, in particular with the objective of achieving good environmental status by 2020 as set out in Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC.
The plan specifies details for the implementation of the landing obligation in Union waters of the North Sea for all stocks of species to which the landing obligation applies under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The plan applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/975 — laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area.
The regulation aims to ensure that the conservation and management measures adopted by the SPRFMO (‘SPRFMO conservation and management measures’) are fully transposed into EU law and are, therefore, uniformly and effectively implemented within the EU.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
the EU fishing vessels operating in the SPRFMO Convention Area;
the EU fishing vessels transhipping fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area;
third country fishing vessels upon requesting access to, or being the object of an inspection in, EU ports and carrying fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area.
The regulation defines the following:
‘SPRFMO Convention Area’: the geographical area marked out in Article 5 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (‘the SPRFMO Convention’);
‘fishing vessel’: any vessel of any size used or intended for use for the purposes of commercial exploitation of fishery resources, including support ships, fish processing vessels, vessels engaged in transhipment and carrier vessels equipped for the transportation of fishery products, except container vessels;
‘Union fishing vessel’: a fishing vessel flying the flag of an EU Member State and registered in the EU;
‘SPRFMO fishery resources’: all marine biological resources within the SPRFMO Convention Area excluding:
sedentary species in so far as they are subject to the national jurisdiction of coastal States pursuant to Article 77, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (‘UNCLOS’);
highly migratory species listed in Annex I to UNCLOS;
anadromous and catadromous species;
marine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds;
‘SPRFMO fishery products’: aquatic organisms, or products derived therefrom, resulting from any fishing activity within the SPRFMO Convention Area;
‘fishing activity’: searching for fish, shooting, setting, towing, hauling of a fishing gear, taking catch on board, transhipping, retaining on board, processing on board, transferring and landing of fish and fishery products;
‘bottom fishing’: the fishing by any fishing vessel using any gear which is likely to come in contact with the seafloor or benthic organisms during the normal course of operations;
‘bottom fishing footprint’: the spatial extent of bottom fishing in the SPRFMO Convention Area during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006;
‘IUU fishing’: any illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing activities as defined in points 1 to 4 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008;
‘draft SPRFMO IUU vessel list’: the initial list of fishing vessels presumed to have undertaken IUU fishing, as drafted by the SPRFMO Secretariat and submitted to the SPRFMO Compliance and Technical Committee for consideration;
‘exploratory fishery’: a fishery that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique in the previous 10 years;
‘large-scale pelagic driftnet’: a gillnet or other net, or a combination of nets, which is more than 2,5 kilometres in length the purpose of which is to enmesh, entrap or entangle fish by drifting on the surface or in the water;
‘deepwater gillnets’: e.g. trammel nets, set nets, anchored nets, sink nets, means strings of single, double or triple netting walls, held vertically, on or near the bottom, in which fish will gill, entangle or enmesh. Deepwater gillnets consist of single or, less commonly, double or triple netting mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear. Those nets can be used either alone or, as is more usual, in large numbers placed in line (‘fleets’ of nets). The gear can be set, anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected with the vessel;
‘SPRFMO Cooperating Non-Contracting Party’: (CNCP) a State or fishing entity that it is not a party to the SPRFMO Convention but has agreed to fully cooperate in the implementation of the SPRFMO conservation and management measures;
‘SPRFMO record of vessels’: the list of fishing vessels authorised to fish in the SPRFMO Convention Area, as notified by the Contracting Parties and CNCPs, which is maintained by the SPRFMO Secretariat;
‘transhipment’: the unloading of all or any fishery products on board a fishing vessel to another fishing vessel;
‘other species of concern’: species listed in Annex XIII;
‘vulnerable marine ecosystem’: (VME) any marine ecosystem the integrity (i.e. ecosystem structure or function) of which is, according to the best scientific information available and to the precautionary principle, threatened by significant adverse impacts resulting from physical contact with bottom gears in the normal course of fishing operations, including reefs, seamounts, hydrothermal vents, cold water corals or cold water sponge beds.

The competent authorities may detain cash temporarily in certain circumstances, subject to checks and balances: first, where the obligation to declare or to disclose cash has not been met and, second, where there are indications of criminal activity, irrespective of the amount or whether the cash is accompanied or unaccompanied.
The period of detention of the cash may be extended in specific and duly assessed cases, for instance when competent authorities encounter difficulties in obtaining information on a potential criminal activity, inter alia, when communication with a third country is required, when documents have to be translated or when it is difficult to identify and contact the sender or the recipient in the case of unaccompanied cash.
If, at the end of the period of detention, no decision concerning further intervention is taken or if the competent authority decides that there are no grounds to further detain the cash, it should immediately be released, depending on the situation, to the person from whom the cash was temporarily detained, the carrier or the owner.
Exchange of information
The competent authorities of a Member State may exchange information with the authorities of a third country provided that there are appropriate safeguards. Such exchange should only be permissible where relevant national and Union provisions on fundamental rights and the transfer of personal data are complied with, following authorisation by the authorities which originally obtained the information.
The Commission should be informed of any occurrence of information exchange with third countries pursuant to this Regulation and should report thereon to the European Parliament and to the Council.

Waste management
Waste containing or contaminated by any substance listed in Annex IV shall be disposed of or recovered, without undue delay and in accordance with Part 1 of Annex V to the regulation, in such a way as to ensure that the POP content is destroyed or irreversibly transformed so that the remaining waste and releases do not exhibit the characteristics of POPs.
By way of derogation from the above, waste containing or contaminated by any substance listed in Annex IV may be otherwise disposed of or recovered in accordance with the relevant EU legislation, provided that the content of the listed substances in the waste is below the concentration limits specified in Annex IV.
A Member State or the competent authority designated by that Member State may, in exceptional cases, allow wastes listed in Part 2 of Annex V containing or contaminated by a substance listed in Annex IV up to concentration limits specified in Part 2 of Annex V to be otherwise dealt with in accordance with a method listed in Part 2 of Annex V, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:
the holder concerned has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority of the Member State concerned that decontamination of the waste in relation to substances listed in Annex IV was not feasible, and that destruction or irreversible transformation of the POP content, performed in accordance with best environmental practice or best available techniques, does not represent the environmentally preferable option;
the holder concerned has provided information on the POP content of the waste to the competent authority;
the operation is in accordance with relevant EU legislation and with the conditions laid down in relevant additional measures referred to in Article 7(5) of the regulation;
the Member State concerned has informed the other Member States, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Commission of its authorisation and the justification for it.

EU trade mark — codification
EU trade mark — codification
The European Union trade mark (EUTM) is a registered trade mark that covers the whole of the European Union (EU) and is valid in all the EU Member States. It is a legal right that protects goods and services from unauthorised imitation or infringement. It is managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), which is an independent agency.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It codifies Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 which established the EUTM system.
KEY POINTS
The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) manages the EUTM system.
The EUTM is a registered trade mark that covers the whole of the EU and is valid in all the EU Member States. It is a legal right that protects goods and services from unauthorised imitation or infringement.
An EUTM may consist of any sign, including words, designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of their packaging or sounds, provided that such signs are capable of:
distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings; and
being represented on the register in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.
The proprietor of an EUTM is any natural or legal person, including authorities established under public law.
An EUTM shall be obtained by registration.
The following shall not be registered:
signs which do not conform to the requirements of Article 4;
trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;
trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or service;
signs which consist exclusively of:
the shape, or another characteristic, which results from the nature of the goods themselves;
the shape, or another characteristic, of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result;
the shape, or another characteristic, which gives substantial value to the goods;
trade marks which are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality;
trade marks which are of such a nature as to deceive the public, for instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or service;
trade marks which have not been authorised by the competent authorities and are to be refused pursuant to Article 6ter of the Paris Convention;
trade marks which include badges, emblems or escutcheons other than those covered by Article 6ter of the Paris Convention and which are of particular public interest, unless the consent of the competent authority to their registration has been given;
trade marks which are excluded from registration, pursuant to Union legislation or national law or to international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is party, providing for protection of designations of origin and geographical indications;
trade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional terms for wine;
trade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional specialities guaranteed;
trade marks which consist of, or reproduce in their essential elements, an earlier plant variety denomination registered in accordance with Union legislation or national law, or international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is a party, providing for protection of plant variety rights, and which are in respect of plant varieties of the same or closely related species.
The EUTM shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the EU: it shall not be registered, transferred or surrendered or be the subject of a decision revoking the rights of the proprietor or declaring it invalid, nor shall its use be prohibited, save in respect of the whole EU.
The EUTM system is managed by the EUIPO, which is an independent agency.

Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws
Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the conditions under which national authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws cooperate and coordinate their actions with each other and with the European Commission, in order to enforce compliance with those laws and to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market.
KEY POINTS
It applies to infringements covered by this regulation that have done, do or are likely to do harm to the collective interests of consumers in one or more Member States other than the one in which the infringement originated or took place.
This regulation does not apply to infringements covered by Directives 2014/17/EU and 2014/92/EU.
Each EU country must designate one of its competent authorities as the single liaison office. That office has the power to open investigations or proceedings on its own initiative, if it becomes aware of infringements covered by this regulation by means other than consumer complaints.
Competent authorities must have access to any relevant documents, data and information that relate to the subject matter of an investigation or concerted investigations of a consumer market (‘sweeps’). They must also be able to directly request that third parties in the digital value chain provide any relevant evidence, data and information in accordance with Directive 2000/31/EC and in accordance with the legislation on personal data protection.
Competent authorities must be able to carry out necessary on-site inspections, and must have the power to enter any premises, land or means of transport that the trader concerned by the inspection uses for purposes related to his trade, business, craft or profession.
Competent authorities must be able to purchase goods or services as test purchases, where necessary, under a cover identity, in order to detect infringements covered by this regulation, such as refusals to implement the consumer right of withdrawal in the case of distance contracts, and to obtain evidence.
Competent authorities must be able to stop infringements covered by this regulation quickly and effectively, and in particular where the trader selling goods or services conceals his identity or relocates within the EU or to a third country in order to avoid enforcement.
Competent authorities must be able to adopt interim measures in accordance with national law, including the removal of content from an online interface or ordering the explicit display of a warning to consumers when they access an online interface.
The Commission must be better able to coordinate and monitor the functioning of the mutual assistance mechanism, issue guidance, make recommendations and issue opinions to the Member States when problems arise.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the issuance of euro coins
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules on the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation and for collection.
KEY POINTS
Circulation coins
Circulation coins are euro coins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications of which are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98.
Member States may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins.
Circulation coins may be put into circulation at face value or at a price higher than face value. However, a maximum of 5% of the total net value of the circulation coins issued by a Member State may be put on the market above face value. This is subject to the following:
the special quality of the coin;
the special packaging;
any additional services provided.
Commemorative coins
Each Member State whose currency is the euro may only issue 2 commemorative coins per year, save where:
commemorative coins are collectively issued by all Member States whose currency is the euro; or
a commemorative coin is issued on the occasion of a temporary vacancy or a provisional occupation of the function of Head of State.
The total number of commemorative coins put into circulation for each individual issue shall not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all Member States whose currency is the euro up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin; this ceiling may be raised to 2,0% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins of all Member States whose currency is the euro if a widely recognised and highly symbolic subject is commemorated, in which case the issuing Member State shall refrain from launching another commemorative coin issue using the raised ceiling during the subsequent four years and shall set out the reasons for choosing the raised ceiling; or
5.0% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by the Member State concerned up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin.
Collector coins
Collector coins are euro coins intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.
Collector coins may be put on the market at or above face value.
The issuances of collector coins shall be accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.
Member States shall take all appropriate measures to discourage the use of collector coins as a means of payment.
Consultation prior to the destruction of circulation coins
Prior to the destruction of circulation coins which are not euro coins unfit for circulation within the meaning of point (b) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1210/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2010 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation, Member States shall consult each other via the relevant subcommittee of the Economic and Financial Committee and inform the mint directors of the Member States whose currency is the euro.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 24 August 2012.
BACKGROUND
              
The Council conclusions of 23 November 1998 and of 5 November 2002 on euro coins intended for collection, the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC of 19 December 2008 on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation (endorsed by Council conclusions of 10 February 2009), and the Commission Recommendation 2010/191/EU of 22 March 2010 on the scope and effects of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins recommend practices regarding the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, including commemorative euro coins, consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins and the use of euro collector coins.
For more information, please see Euro coins on the European Commission’s website.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 — on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of the fibre composition of textile products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules concerning the use of textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products, rules concerning the labelling or marking of textile products containing non-textile parts of animal origin and rules concerning the determination of the fibre composition of textile products by quantitative analysis of binary and ternary textile fibre mixtures.
It aims to improve the functioning of the internal market and to provide accurate information to consumers.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to textile products when they are made available on the EU market and to products referred to in its Article 2(2).
Products referred to in Article 2(2) include:
products containing at least 80 % by weight of textile fibres;
furniture, umbrella and sunshade coverings containing at least 80 % by weight of textile components;
the textile components of:
upper layers of multi-layer floor coverings;
mattress coverings;
coverings of camping goods;
provided such textile components constitute at least 80 % by weight of such upper layers or coverings.
Textile products which are contracted out to persons working in their own homes or to independent firms that carry out work from materials supplied without the property therein being transferred for consideration, and customised textile products made up by self-employed tailors, are not covered by the regulation.
Definitions
For the purposes of the regulation, the following definitions apply:
textile product: any raw, semi-worked, worked, semi-manufactured, manufactured, semi-made-up or made-up product which is exclusively composed of textile fibres, regardless of the mixing or assembly process employed;
textile fibre: either of the following:
a unit of matter characterised by its flexibility, fineness and high ratio of length to maximum transverse dimension, which render it suitable for textile applications;
a flexible strip or tube, of which the apparent width does not exceed 5 mm, including strips cut from wider strips or films, produced from the substances used for the manufacture of the fibres listed in Table 2 of Annex I and suitable for textile applications;
apparent width: the width of the strip or tube when folded, flattened, compressed or twisted, or the average width where the width is not uniform;
textile component: a part of a textile product with an identifiable fibre content;
extraneous fibres: fibres other than those stated on the label or marking;
lining: a separate component used in making up garments and other products, consisting of a single layer or multiple layers of textile material held in place along one or more of the edges;
labelling: affixing the required information to the textile product by way of attaching a label;
marking: indicating the required information directly on the textile product by way of sewing, embroidering, printing, embossing or any other technology of application;
inclusive labelling: the use of a single label for several textile products or components;
disposable product: a textile product designed to be used only once or for a limited time, and the normal use of which is not intended for subsequent use for the same or a similar purpose;
agreed allowance: the value of moisture regain to be used in the calculation of the percentage of fibre components on a clean, dry mass basis, with adjustment by conventional factors.
Textile fibre names and related labelling and marking requirements
Only the textile fibre names listed in Annex I may be used for the description of fibre compositions on labels and markings of textile products.
The names listed in Annex I may be used for textile fibres the nature of which corresponds to the description set out in that Annex.
The names listed in Annex I may not be used for other fibres, whether on their own or as a root or as an adjective.
The term ‘silk’ may not be used to indicate the shape or particular presentation in continuous filament yarn of textile fibres.
Applications for new textile fibre names
Any manufacturer or any person acting on a manufacturer's behalf may apply to the European Commission to add a new textile fibre name to the list set out in Annex I.
The application shall include a technical file compiled in accordance with Annex II.
Pure textile products
Only textile products exclusively composed of the same fibre may be labelled or marked as ‘100 %’, ‘pure’ or ‘all’.
Those or similar terms may not be used for other textile products.
A textile product containing no more than 2 % by weight of extraneous fibres may also be treated as exclusively composed of the same fibre, provided this quantity is justified as being technically unavoidable in good manufacturing practice and is not added as a matter of routine.
Fleece wool or virgin wool products
A textile product may be labelled or marked by one of the names set out in Annex III provided it is composed exclusively of a wool fibre which has not previously been incorporated in a finished product, which has not been subjected to any spinning and/or felting processes other than those required in the manufacture of that product, and which has not been damaged by treatment or use.
By way of derogation from the first paragraph, the names listed in Annex III may be used to describe wool contained in a textile fibre mixture if all the following conditions are met:
all the wool contained in that mixture satisfies the requirements defined in the first paragraph;
such wool accounts for not less than 25 % of the total weight of the mixture;
in the case of a scribbled mixture, the wool is mixed with only one other fibre.
The full percentage composition of such mixture must be given.
The extraneous fibres in the products referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, including wool products which have undergone a carding process, shall not exceed 0,3 % by weight, shall be justified as being technically unavoidable in good manufacturing practice and shall not be added as a matter of routine.
Multi-fibre textile products
A textile product shall be labelled or marked with the name and percentage by weight of all constituent fibres in descending order.
By way of derogation from the first paragraph, and without prejudice to Article 7(2), a fibre which accounts for up to 5 % of the total weight of the textile product, or fibres which collectively account for up to 15 % of the total weight of the textile product, may, where they cannot easily be stated at the time of the manufacture, be designated by the term ‘other fibres’, immediately preceded or followed by their total percentage by weight.
Products having a pure cotton warp and a pure flax weft, in which the percentage of flax accounts for at least 40 % of the total weight of the unsized fabric may be given the name ‘cotton linen union’ which must be accompanied by the composition specification ‘pure cotton warp — pure flax (or linen) weft’.
Without prejudice to Article 5(1), fibres not yet listed in Annex I may be designated by the term ‘other fibres’, immediately preceded or followed by their total percentage by weight.
Decorative fibres and fibres with antistatic effect
Visible, isolable fibres which are purely decorative and

Summary 140:
EU rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at airports
EU rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at airports
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) wants to reduce aircraft noise around its airports. The European Parliament and the Council have therefore adopted Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives at the level of individual airports, while respecting relevant EU rules, in particular those laid down in Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise and the legislation within each EU Member State.
It also enables the use of operating restrictions in accordance with the Balanced Approach so as to achieve the sustainable development of the airport and air traffic management network capacity from a gate-to-gate perspective.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It does not apply to aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar operations.
Member States must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for the process to be followed when adopting operating restrictions.
The competent authorities must be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.
The Member States must notify the European Commission, in a timely manner, of the names and addresses of the designated competent authorities.
The Member States must ensure the right to appeal against operating restrictions adopted pursuant to this Regulation before an appeal body other than the authority that adopted the contested restriction, in accordance with national legislation and procedures.
The Member States must ensure that the noise situation at an individual airport is assessed on a regular basis, in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC and the legislation applicable within each Member State.
The competent authorities must ensure that the noise situation at airports for which they are responsible is assessed on a regular basis, in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC and the legislation applicable within each Member State.
If the assessment referred to in the previous paragraph indicates that new operating restriction measures may be required to address a noise problem at an airport, the competent authorities must ensure that:
the method, indicators and information in Annex I are applied in such a way as to take due account of the contribution of each type of measure under the Balanced Approach, before operating restrictions are introduced;
at the appropriate level, technical cooperation is established between the airport operators, aircraft operators and air navigation service providers to examine measures to mitigate noise. The competent authorities must also ensure that local residents, or their representatives, and relevant local authorities are consulted, and that technical information on noise mitigation measures is provided to them;
the cost-effectiveness of any new operating restriction is assessed, in accordance with Annex II. Minor technical amendments to measures without substantive implications on capacity or operations shall not be considered new operating restrictions;
the process of consultation with interested parties, which may take the form of a mediation process, is organised in a timely and substantive manner, ensuring openness and transparency as regards data and computation methodologies. Interested parties must have at least 3 months prior to the adoption of the new operating restrictions to submit comments. The interested parties must include at least:
local residents living in the vicinity of the airport and affected by air traffic noise, or their representatives, and the relevant local authorities;
representatives of local businesses based in the vicinity of the airport, whose activities are affected by air traffic and the operation of the airport;
relevant airport operators;
representatives of those aircraft operators which may be affected by noise-related actions;
the relevant air navigation service providers;
where applicable, the designated slots coordinator.
The competent authorities must follow up and monitor the implementation of the operating restrictions and take action as appropriate. They must ensure that relevant information is made available free of charge and that it is readily and promptly accessible to local residents living in the vicinity of the airports and to the relevant local authorities.
The relevant information may include:
while respecting national law, information on alleged infringements due to changes in flight procedures, in terms of their impact and the reasons why such changes were made;
the general criteria applied when distributing and managing traffic in each airport, to the extent that those criteria may have an environmental or noise impact; and
data collected by noise measuring systems, if available.
Decisions on noise-related operating restrictions must be based on the noise performance of the aircraft as determined by the certification procedure conducted in accordance with Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention, sixth edition of March 2011.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 of the regulation concerning:
technical updates to the noise certification standards provided for in Article 5(5) and point (a) of Article 9(1), and to the certification procedure provided for in Article 7(1);

It applies from 13 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
              
The European Union (EU) wants to reduce aircraft noise around its airports. The European Parliament and the Council have therefore adopted Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach.
For more information, please see:
Noise at airports (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Aircraft. Fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass of 34 000 kg or with a certificated maximum internal accommodation for the aircraft type in question consisting of 19 passenger seats or more, excluding any seats for crew only.
Airport. An airport which has more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per calendar year (a movement being a take-off or landing), on the basis of the average number of movements in the last three calendar years before the noise assessment.
Balanced Approach. The process developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization under which the range of available measures, namely the reduction of aircraft noise at source, land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions, is considered in a consistent way with a view to addressing the noise problem in the most cost-effective way on an airport-by-airport basis.
Noise-related action. Any measure that affects the noise climate around airports, for which the principles of the Balanced Approach apply, including other non-operational actions that can affect the number of people significantly affected by potentially harmful effects of aircraft noise.
Operating restriction. A noise-related action that limits access to or reduces the operational capacity of an airport, including operating restrictions aimed at the withdrawal from operations of marginally compliant aircraft at specific airports as well as operating restrictions of a partial nature, which for example apply for an identified period of time during the day or only for certain runways at the airport.

European rail network for competitive freight
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 — concerning a European rail network for competitive freight
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European rail network for competitive freight (ERRCF) to increase the efficiency of rail freight transport.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down rules for the establishment and organisation of international rail corridors for competitive rail freight with a view to the development of a European rail network for competitive freight.
It sets out rules for the selection, organisation, management and the indicative investment planning of freight corridors.
The regulation applies to the management and use of railway infrastructure included in freight corridors.
The regulation defines ‘freight corridor’ as all designated railway lines, including railway ferry lines, on the territory of or between Member States, and, where appropriate, European third countries, linking two or more terminals, along a principal route and, where appropriate, diversionary routes and sections connecting them, including the railway infrastructure and its equipment and relevant rail services in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2001/14/EC.
The regulation defines ‘implementation plan’ as the document presenting the means and the strategy that the parties concerned intend to implement in order to develop over a specified period the measures which are necessary and sufficient to establish the freight corridor.
The regulation defines ‘terminal’ as the installation provided along the freight corridor which has been specially arranged to allow either the loading and/or the unloading of goods onto/from freight trains, and the integration of rail freight services with road, maritime, river and air services, and either the forming or modification of the composition of freight trains; and, where necessary, performing border procedures at borders with European third countries.
Designation of initial freight corridors
The Member States referred to in the Annex shall make operational by the dates set out therein the initial freight corridors set out in the Annex. The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission about the establishment of the freight corridors.
Selection of further freight corridors
Each Member State with a rail border with another Member State shall participate in the establishment of at least one freight corridor, unless this obligation has already been met under the initial freight corridors.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States shall, upon request from a Member State, participate in the establishment of the freight corridor as referred to in that paragraph or the prolongation of an existing corridor, in order to allow a neighbouring Member State to fulfil its obligation under that paragraph.
Where a Member State considers, after having provided a socio-economic analysis, that the establishment of a freight corridor would not be in the interest of the applicants likely to use the freight corridor or would not bring significant socio-economic benefits or would cause a disproportionate burden, the Member State concerned shall not be obliged to participate as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, subject to a decision of the Commission acting in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(2).
A Member State shall not be obliged to participate as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 if it has a rail network which has a track gauge which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union.
The establishment of a freight corridor shall be proposed by the Member States concerned. For this purpose they shall send jointly to the Commission a letter of intent including a proposal drawn up after consultation of the infrastructure managers and applicants concerned, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4.
The Commission shall examine the proposals for the establishment of a freight corridor as referred to in paragraph 5 and, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 21(3), adopt a decision on the compliance of such a proposal with this Article at the latest 9 months after submission of the proposal.
The Member States concerned shall establish the freight corridor at the latest two years after the decision of the Commission referred to in paragraph 6.
Governance of freight corridors
For each freight corridor, Member States concerned shall establish an executive board responsible for defining the general objectives of the freight corridor, supervising and taking the measures as expressly provided for in paragraph 7 of this Article, and in Articles 9 and 11, Article 14(1) and Article 22. The executive board shall be composed of representatives of the authorities of the Member States concerned.
For each freight corridor, the infrastructure managers concerned and, where relevant, the allocation bodies as referred to in Article 14(2) of Directive 2001/14/EC, shall establish a management board responsible for taking the measures as expressly provided for in paragraphs 5, 7, 8 and 9 of this Article, and in Articles 9 to 12, Article 13(1), Article 14(2), (6) and (9), Article 16(1), Article 17(1) and Articles 18 and 19 of this Regulation. The management board shall be composed of the representatives of the infrastructure managers.
The Member States and infrastructure managers concerned by a freight corridor shall cooperate within the boards referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to ensure the development of the freight corridor in accordance with its implementation plan.
The executive board shall take its decisions on the basis of mutual consent of the representatives of the authorities of the Member States concerned.
The management board shall take its decisions, including decisions regarding its legal status, the establishment of its organisational structure, resources and staffing, on the basis of mutual consent of the infrastructure managers concerned. The management board may be an independent legal entity. It may take the form of a European economic interest grouping within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2137/85 of 25 July 1985 on the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG).
The responsibilities of the executive and management boards shall be without prejudice to the independence of infrastructure managers as provided for in Article 4(2) of Directive 91/440/EEC.
The management board shall set up an advisory group made up of managers and owners of the terminals of the freight corridor including, where necessary, sea and inland waterway ports. This advisory group may issue an opinion on any proposal by the management board which has direct consequences for investment and the management of terminals. It may also issue own-initiative opinions. The management board shall take any of these opinions into account. In the event of disagreement between the management board and the advisory group, the latter may refer the matter to the executive board. The executive board shall act as an intermediary and provide its opinion in due time. The final decision however shall be taken by the management board.
The management board shall set up a further advisory group made up of railway undertakings interested in the use of the freight corridor. This advisory group may issue an opinion on any proposal by the management board which has consequences for these undertakings. It may also issue own-initiative opinions. The management board shall take any of these opinions into account.
The management board shall coordinate in accordance with national and European deployment plans the use of interoperable IT applications or alternative solutions that may become available in the future to handle requests for international train paths and the operation of international traffic on the freight corridor.
Investment in the freight corridor
The management board shall draw up and periodically review an investment plan, which includes details of indicative medium and long-term investment for infrastructure in the freight corridor, and shall submit it for approval to the executive board. This plan

HYDROGEN-POWERED VEHICLES
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes rules for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered vehicles, hydrogen components and hydrogen systems.
It establishes requirements for the installation of hydrogen components and systems.
It lays down penalties for non-compliance with the rules.
KEY POINTS
Hydrogen is considered to be a clean way of powering vehicles for the future, as vehicles propelled with hydrogen emit neither carbon-based pollutants nor greenhouse gases. However, hydrogen-powered vehicles may require a specific treatment from rescue services. It is therefore necessary to lay down requirements for the clear and rapid identification of such vehicles, allowing the rescue services to be informed of the fuel stored on board the vehicle.
Hydrogen components and systems must function in a correct and safe way and reliably withstand electrical, mechanical, thermal and chemical operating conditions without leaking or visibly deforming.
Hydrogen systems must be protected against over-pressurisation.
The materials used for those parts of the hydrogen components and systems which are to be in direct contact with hydrogen must be compatible with hydrogen.
Hydrogen components and systems reliably withstand expected temperatures and pressures during their expected lifetime.
Hydrogen components and systems reliably withstand the range of operating temperatures laid down in the implementing measures.
Hydrogen components must be marked in accordance with the implementing measures.
Hydrogen components with directional flow must have the flow direction clearly indicated.
Hydrogen components and systems must be designed in such a way that they can be installed in accordance with the requirements of Annex VI.
Hydrogen containers designed to use liquid hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex II.
Hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use liquid hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex III.
Hydrogen containers designed to use compressed (gaseous) hydrogen must be classified in accordance with point 1 of Annex IV.
The containers referred to in the first subparagraph must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex IV.
Hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use compressed (gaseous) hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex V.
Hydrogen components and systems must be installed in accordance with the requirements of Annex VI.
The Commission may adopt implementing measures in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RRS), including those relating to:
requirements relating to any of the following:
the use of pure hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas/biomethane;
new forms of hydrogen storage or usage;
the impact protection of vehicles with regard to the integrity of hydrogen components and systems;
integrated system safety requirements, covering at least the detection of leakage and requirements relating to purge gas;
electrical isolation and electric safety;
other measures necessary for the application of this Regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 24 February 2011.

Summary 150:
procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on particular matters of civil justice
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
This Regulation establishes a procedure to authorise a Member State to amend an existing agreement or to negotiate and conclude a new agreement with a third country.
Scope
This procedure is without prejudice to the respective competencies of the Community and of the Member States.
This Regulation shall apply to agreements concerning particular matters falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II).
Definition
For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘agreement’ shall mean:
a bilateral agreement between a Member State and a third country;
a regional agreement between a limited number of Member States and of third countries neighbouring Member States which is intended to address local situations and which is not open for accession to other States.
Notification to the Commission
Where a Member State intends to enter into negotiations in order to amend an existing agreement or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of this Regulation, it shall notify the Commission in writing of its intention at the earliest possible moment before the envisaged opening of formal negotiations.
The notification shall include, as appropriate, a copy of the existing agreement, the draft agreement or the draft proposal, and any other relevant documentation. The Member State shall describe the subject matter of the negotiations and specify the issues which are to be addressed in the envisaged agreement, or the provisions of the existing agreement which are to be amended. The Member State may provide any other additional information.
Assessment by the Commission
Upon receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3, the Commission shall assess whether the Member State may open formal negotiations.
In making that assessment, the Commission shall first check whether any relevant negotiating mandate with a view to concluding a Community agreement with the third country concerned is specifically envisaged within the next 24 months. If this is not the case, the Commission shall assess whether all of the following conditions are met:
the Member State concerned has provided information showing that it has a specific interest in concluding the agreement due to economic, geographic, cultural, historical, social or political ties between the Member State and the third country concerned;
on the basis of the information provided by the Member State, the envisaged agreement appears not to render Community law ineffective and not to undermine the proper functioning of the system established by that law; and
the envisaged agreement would not undermine the object and purpose of the Community’s external relations policy as decided by the Community.
If the information provided by the Member State is not sufficient for the purposes of the assessment, the Commission may request additional information.
Authorisation to open formal negotiations
If the envisaged agreement meets the conditions set out in Article 4(2), the Commission shall, within 90 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3, give a reasoned decision on the application of the Member State authorising it to open formal negotiations on that agreement.
The envisaged agreement shall contain a clause providing for either:
full or partial denunciation of the agreement in the event of the conclusion of a subsequent agreement between the Community or the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the same third country, on the other hand, on the same subject matter; or
direct replacement of the relevant provisions of the agreement by the provisions of a subsequent agreement concluded between the Community or the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the same third country, on the other hand, on the same subject matter.
Refusal to authorise the opening of formal negotiations
If, on the basis of its assessment under Article 4, the Commission intends not to authorise the opening of formal negotiations on the envisaged agreement, it shall give an opinion to the Member State concerned within 90 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3.
Within 30 days of receipt of the opinion of the Commission, the Member State concerned may request the Commission to enter into discussions with it with a view to finding a solution.
If the Member State concerned does not request the Commission to enter into discussions with it within the time limit provided for in paragraph 2, the Commission shall give a reasoned decision on the application of the Member State within 130 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3.
Participation of the Commission in the negotiations
The Commission may participate as an observer in the negotiations between the Member State and the third country as far as matters falling within the scope of this Regulation are concerned. If the Commission does not participate as an observer, it shall be kept informed of the progress and results throughout the different stages of the negotiations.
Authorisation to conclude the agreement
Before signing a negotiated agreement, the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission and shall transmit to it the text of the agreement.
Upon receipt of that notification the Commission shall assess whether the negotiated agreement:
meets the condition set out in Article 4(2)(b);
meets the condition set out in Article 4(2)(c), in so far as there are new and exceptional circumstances in relation to that condition; and
fulfils the requirement under Article 5(2).
If the negotiated agreement fulfils the conditions and requirements referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission shall, within 90 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 8(1), give a reasoned decision on the application of the Member State authorising it to conclude that agreement.
Refusal to authorise the conclusion of the agreement
If, on the basis of its assessment under Article 8(2), the Commission intends not to authorise the conclusion of the negotiated agreement, it shall give an opinion to the Member State concerned, as well as to the European Parliament and to the Council, within 90 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 8(1).
Within 30 days of receipt of the opinion of the Commission, the Member State concerned may request the Commission to enter into discussions with it with a view to finding a solution.
If the Member State concerned does not request the Commission to enter into discussions with it within the time limit provided for in paragraph 2, the Commission shall give a reasoned decision on the application of the Member State within 130 days of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 8(1).
The Commission shall notify its decision to the European Parliament and to the Council within 30 days of the decision.
Confidentiality
When providing information to the Commission under Articles 3, 4(3) and 8, the Member State may indicate whether any of the information is to be regarded as confidential and whether the information provided can be shared with other Member States.
Provision of information to the Member States
The Commission shall send to the Member States the notifications received under Articles 3 and 8 and, if necessary, the accompanying documents, as well as all its reasoned decisions under Articles 5, 6, 8 and 9, subject to the confidentiality requirements.

2013 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for the Union’s waters and fishing fleets, setting out the objectives, principles and measures that must be applied to manage and develop fisheries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The CFP covers:
the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources;
in relation to market and financial measures in support of the implementation of the CFP: fresh water biological resources, aquaculture, and the processing and marketing of fisheries and aquaculture products.
The CFP covers the activities referred to in the above points where they are carried out:
on the territory of Member States;
in Union waters, including by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries;
by Union fishing vessels outside Union waters; or
by nationals of Member States, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State.
Objectives
The CFP aims to ensure that:
fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies;
exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield.
In order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.
Principles of good governance
The CFP is guided by the following principles of good governance:
the clear definition of responsibilities at the Union, regional, national and local levels;
the taking into account of regional specificities, through a regionalised approach;
the establishment of measures in accordance with the best available scientific advice;
a long-term perspective;
administrative cost efficiency;
appropriate involvement of stakeholders, in particular Advisory Councils, at all stages - from conception to implementation of the measures;
the primary responsibility of the flag State;
consistency with other Union policies;

The objectives of associations of producer organisations are:
performing in a more efficient and sustainable manner any of the objectives of the member producer organisations laid down in Article 7;
coordinating and developing activities of common interest for the member producer organisations.
Inter-branch organisations
Inter-branch organisations may be established at the initiative of operators of fishery and aquaculture products in one or more EU countries and recognised in accordance with the rules set out in the regulation.
Inter-branch organisations must improve the coordination of, and the conditions for, making fishery and aquaculture products available on the Union market.
The following measures may be used to achieve the objectives of inter-branch organisations:
drawing up standard contracts which are compatible with Union legislation;
promoting Union fishery and aquaculture products in a non-discriminatory manner by using, for example, certification, and in particular designations of origin, quality seals, geographical designations, traditional specialities guaranteed, and sustainability merits;
laying down rules on the production and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products which are stricter than those laid down in Union or national legislation;
improving quality, knowledge of, and the transparency of, production and the market, as well as carrying out professional and vocational training activities, for example, on quality and traceability matters, on food safety and in order to encourage research initiatives;
performing research and market studies, and developing techniques to optimise the operation of the market, including through the use of information and communication technology, as well as collecting socio-economic data;
providing the information and carrying out the research needed to deliver sustainable supplies at the quantity, quality and price corresponding to market requirements and consumer expectations;
promoting, among consumers, species obtained from fish stocks that are in a sustainable state, that have appreciable nutritional value and that are not widely consumed;
controlling and taking measures for compliance of their members’ activities with the rules established by the inter-branch organisation concerned.

Regulation on securities settlement
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the efficiency and safety of securities settlement in the European Union (EU) by laying down uniform obligations for market participants, as well as a set of common requirements for central securities depositories (CSDs).
The regulation establishes a single market for securities settlement in the EU, where any investor in the EU may invest in all EU securities with the same ease as in domestic securities and using the same processes.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to the settlement of transactions in all financial instruments and activities of CSDs.
It also applies to transactions in transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, which are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU (see summary) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (see summary).
It does not apply to transactions in financial instruments that are subject to initial recording in book-entry form.
CSDs
CSDs are responsible for the operation of securities settlement systems and for the application of measures to provide timely settlement in the EU. It is therefore essential to ensure that all CSDs are safe and sound and comply at all times with stringent organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements laid down in the regulation, including by taking all reasonable steps to mitigate fraud and negligence.
CSDs are defined by reference to certain core services, which consist of settlement, implying the operation of a securities settlement system, notary and central securities accounts maintenance services.
A CSD should at least operate a securities settlement system and provide one other core service.
CSDs should have in place recovery plans to ensure continuity of their critical operations.
CSDs should be authorised by the competent national authorities before starting their activities.
CSDs should be subject to authorisation and supervision by the competent authority of their home Member State.

Direct payments to farmers
Direct payments to farmers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP)
Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 from the European Parliament and the Council establishing uniform supported for farmers within the framework of the CAP
WHAT IS THE AIMS OF THE REGULATIONS?
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and replaces it with a new text.
Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 and replaces them with a new text.
The purpose of both regulations is to reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) in order to ensure that it is better targeted and more effective.
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down the rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the CAP. It applies from 1 January 2014.
KEY POINTS
Eligible farmers
Farmers are eligible for direct payments if they:
have a permanent operating basis and have been active in agriculture during the reference period (the year preceding the year in which the payment is due);
fulfil the conditions for good agricultural and environmental condition and good results in the cross-compliance control system;
are not subject to any exclusion or administrative penalty under Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
Direct payments
Farmers may receive 2 types of direct payments:
basic payment: this is a payment made per hectare of land that is eligible for support and that a farmer has in his/her holding;
premium: this is a payment made to farmers who comply with the specific rules of the sector-specific support schemes (see Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013).
Basic payment
Farmers may receive a basic payment if they:
are eligible for direct payments;
have a permanent operating basis;
have a land area of 2 hectares or more.
The basic payment is calculated on the basis of the number of payment entitlements that a farmer holds and the value of those entitlements.
Payment entitlements
A payment entitlement is an instrument that allows a farmer to receive the basic payment for a certain number of hectares. A farmer can hold payment entitlements by virtue of:
owning land;
leasing land;
having a share in a partnership.
A farmer may hold several payment entitlements, but the total number of payment entitlements held may not exceed the number of hectares of land he/she has.
The value of the payment entitlements determines the amount of the basic payment received by the farmer.
The basic payment may be granted to farmers who:
have inherited or acquired a holding;
have leased a holding;
are the beneficiary of an inheritance contract.
Single area payment scheme
Farmers in the following EU countries may apply the single area payment scheme until 31 December 2020:
Cyprus;
Greece;
Italy;
Latvia;
Lithuania;
Portugal;
Romania;
Slovenia.
For these countries, the basic payment may be granted to farmers who:
have a permanent operating basis;
have a land area of 2 hectares or more;
have been active in agriculture during the reference period.
Premium
Farmers may receive a premium if they:
have a permanent operating basis;
have been active in agriculture during the reference period;
fulfil the conditions for good agricultural and environmental condition and good results in the cross-compliance control system;
are not subject to any exclusion or administrative penalty under Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
The premium may be granted to farmers who:
have inherited or acquired a holding;
have leased a holding;
are the beneficiary of an inheritance contract.

Summary 162:
EU support for small islands in the Aegean Sea
EU support for small islands in the Aegean Sea
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands to mitigate the difficulties caused by the particular geographical situation of the smaller Aegean islands.
KEY POINTS
The specific measures provided for in the regulation are defined by a support programme comprising:
specific supply arrangements;
specific measures to assist local agricultural production.
The support programme is established at the geographical level deemed most appropriate by Greece.
The specific supply arrangements are established for the Union’s agricultural products which are essential in the smaller islands for human consumption, for the manufacture of other products or as agricultural inputs.
The aid granted to supply the smaller islands with agricultural products is determined for each product concerned, taking account of the additional costs of marketing products in the smaller islands, calculated from the usual ports of shipment in mainland Greece, and from the ports of islands of transit or of loading for the islands of final destination. In the case of agricultural inputs and products intended for processing, such aid should take account of the additional costs associated with insularity, small size and distance from markets.
The specific supply arrangements only apply to products of sound, fair and marketable quality.
In implementing the specific supply arrangements, account is taken, in particular, of the following:
the specific needs of the smaller islands and the precise quality requirements;
traditional trade flows with ports in mainland Greece and between the islands in the Aegean Sea;
the economic aspect of the proposed aid;
where applicable, the need not to obstruct the development of local products.
In implementing the specific supply arrangements, the aid granted is subject to the condition that the impact of the economic advantage is passed on up to the end-user who, as appropriate, may be the consumer in the case of products meant for direct consumption, the end processor or packager in the case of products meant for the processing or packaging industries, or farmers in the case of products used for animal feed or as agricultural inputs.
The aid provided for in Article 9(1) is granted on presentation of a certificate.
The aid provided for in the regulation is financed under the financial allocation referred to in Article 18(2) and (3). The support programme comprises a forecast supply balance indicating the products, the quantities thereof and the amount of aid for supply from the Union together with a draft programme of support for local production.
The Commission may authorise, in accordance with Article 108 of the Treaty, operating aid in the sectors producing, processing, marketing and transporting the agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty, with a view to alleviating the specific constraints on farming in the smaller islands as a result of their insularity, small size, mountainous terrain and climate, their economic dependency on a small number of products and their distance from markets.
The Union shall finance the measures provided for in Chapters III and IV up to a maximum annual amount of EUR 23,93 million.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing the requirements in accordance with which Greece may amend the allocation of resources allocated each year to the various products benefiting from the specific supply arrangements.

Summary 164:
Service of documents in civil or commercial matters (Service of documents)
Service of documents in civil or commercial matters (Service of documents)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters between EU countries.
It repeals Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000.
KEY POINTS
Service of documents
The regulation applies where a judicial or extra-judicial document has to be transmitted from one EU country to another for service there.
The document must be accompanied by a standard form.
The form must be completed in the official language of the EU country addressed or in another language that country accepts.
The document and any accompanying papers must be exempt from legalisation or any equivalent formalities.
When the transmitting agency wishes a copy of the document to be returned together with the certificate, it must send the document in duplicate.
The applicant must be advised by the transmitting agency to which he forwards the document for transmission that the addressee may refuse to accept it if it is not in one of the languages provided for in the regulation.
The applicant must bear any costs of translation prior to the transmission of the document, without prejudice to any possible subsequent decision by the court or competent authority on liability for such costs.
The receiving agency must, as soon as possible and in any event within 7 days of receipt, send a receipt to the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means of transmission using the standard form.
Where the request for service cannot be fulfilled on the basis of the information or documents transmitted, the receiving agency must contact the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means in order to secure the missing information or documents.
If the request for service is manifestly outside the scope of the regulation or if non-compliance with the formal conditions required makes service impossible, the request and the documents transmitted must be returned, on receipt, to the transmitting agency, together with the notice of return using the standard form.
A receiving agency receiving a document for service but not having territorial jurisdiction to serve it must forward it, as well as the request, to the receiving agency having territorial jurisdiction in the same EU country if the request complies with the conditions laid down in the regulation and must inform the transmitting agency accordingly using the standard form. That receiving agency must inform the transmitting agency when it receives the document, in the manner provided for in the regulation.
The receiving agency must itself serve the document or have it served, either in accordance with the law of the EU country addressed or by a particular method requested by the transmitting agency, unless that method is incompatible with the law of that EU country.
The receiving agency must take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within 1 month of receipt. If it has not been possible to effect service within 1 month of receipt, the receiving agency must:
immediately inform the transmitting agency by means of the certificate in the standard form;
continue to take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document, unless indicated otherwise by the transmitting agency, where service seems to be possible within a reasonable period of time.
The receiving agency must inform the addressee, using the standard form, that he may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within 1 week if it is not written in, or accompanied by a translation into, either of the following languages:
a language which the addressee understands; or
the official language of the EU country addressed or, if there are several official languages in that EU country, the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected.
If the receiving agency is informed that the addressee refuses to accept the document in accordance with the regulation, it must immediately inform the transmitting agency by means of the certificate provided for in the regulation and return the request and the documents of which a translation is requested.
If the addressee has refused to accept the document pursuant to the regulation, the service of the document can be remedied through the service on the addressee in accordance with the provisions of the regulation of the document accompanied by a translation into a language provided for in the regulation.
The date of service of the document must be the date on which the document accompanied by the translation is served in accordance with the law of the EU country addressed. However, where according to the law of an EU country, a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant must be the date of the service of the initial document determined pursuant to the regulation.
The date of service of a document must be the date on which it is served in accordance with the law of the EU country addressed.
However, where according to the law of an EU country a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant must be the date determined by the law of that EU country.
The certificate of service and a copy of the document served must be drawn up using the standard form.
The service of judicial documents coming from an EU country must not give rise to any payment or reimbursement of taxes or costs for services rendered by the EU country addressed.
However, the applicant must pay or reimburse the costs occasioned by:
recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the EU country addressed;
the use of a particular method of service.
Costs occasioned by recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the EU country addressed must correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that EU country in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.
Extrajudicial documents may be transmitted for service in another EU country in accordance with the provisions of the regulation.
Transmitting and receiving agencies
Each EU country must designate the public officers, authorities or other persons competent for the transmission of judicial or extrajudicial documents to be served in another EU country.
Each EU country must designate the public officers, authorities or other persons competent for the receipt of judicial or extrajudicial documents from another EU country.
A country may designate one transmitting agency and one receiving agency, or one agency to perform both functions. A federal State, a State in which several legal systems apply or a State with autonomous territorial units must be free to designate more than one such agency. The designation must have effect for a period of 5 years and may be renewed at 5-year intervals.
Each EU country must provide the Commission with the following information:
the names and addresses of the receiving agencies referred to in the regulation;
the geographical areas in which they have jurisdiction;
the means of receipt of documents available to them; and
the languages that may be used for the completion of the standard form.
The EU country must notify the Commission of any subsequent modification of such information.
Each EU country must designate a central body responsible for:
supplying information to the transmitting agencies;
seeking solutions to any difficulties which may arise during transmission of documents for service;
forwarding, in exceptional cases, at the request of a transmitting agency, a request for service to the competent receiving agency.
A federal State, a State in which several legal systems apply or a State with autonomous territorial units must be free to designate more than one central body



Summary 165:
Advanced therapy medicinal products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down specific rules for the authorisation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs).
It amends Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2007.
KEY POINTS
Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs)
ATMPs are defined as:
a gene therapy medicinal product;
a somatic cell therapy medicinal product;
a tissue engineered product.
An ATMP contains or consists of engineered cells or tissues and is presented as having properties for, or is used in or administered to human beings with a view to regenerating, repairing or replacing a human tissue.
A tissue engineered product may contain cells or tissues of human or animal origin, or both. The cells or tissues may be viable or non-viable. It may also contain additional substances, such as cellular products, biomolecules, biomaterials, chemical substances, scaffolds or matrices.
Products containing or consisting exclusively of non-viable human or animal cells and/or tissues, which do not contain any viable cells or tissues and which do not act principally by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, shall be excluded from this definition.
Manufacturing
The Commission shall draw up guidelines on good manufacturing practice (GMP) specific to ATMPs.
Clinical trials
The rules laid down in Directive 2001/83/EC in respect of gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products shall apply to tissue engineered products.
Traceability
The holder of a marketing authorisation for an ATMP shall establish and maintain a system ensuring that the individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport and delivery to the hospital, institution or private practice where the product is used.
The hospital, institution or private practice where the ATMP is used shall establish and maintain a system for patient and product traceability. That system shall contain sufficient detail to allow linking of each product to the patient who received it and vice versa.
Where an ATMP contains human cells or tissues, the marketing authorisation holder, as well as the hospital, institution or private practice where the product is used, shall ensure that the traceability systems established in accordance with the regulation are complementary to, and compatible with, the requirements laid down in Directive 2004/23/EC as regards human cells and tissues other than blood cells, and in Directive 2002/98/EC as regards human blood cells.
The marketing authorisation holder shall keep the data referred to in the regulation for a minimum of 30 years after the expiry date of the product, or longer if required by the Commission as a term of the marketing authorisation.
Certification of data
The Commission shall draw up guidelines on the certification of data on the quality and safety of ATMPs.
Evaluation procedure
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) shall consult the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) on any scientific assessment of ATMPs necessary to draw up the scientific opinions referred to in Article 5(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The CAT shall also be consulted in the event of re-examination of the opinion pursuant to Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
When preparing a draft opinion for final approval by the CHMP, the CAT shall endeavour to reach a scientific consensus. If such consensus cannot be reached, the CAT shall adopt the position of the majority of its members. The draft opinion shall mention the divergent positions and the grounds on which they are based.
The draft opinion given by the CAT under paragraph 1 shall be sent to the Chairman of the CHMP in a timely manner so as to ensure that the deadline laid down in Article 6(3) or Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 can be met.
Post-authorisation follow-up
In addition to the requirements for pharmacovigilance laid down in Articles 21 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the applicant shall detail, in the marketing authorisation application, the measures envisaged to ensure the follow-up of efficacy of ATMPs and of adverse reactions thereto.
The Commission shall, on the advice of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), require as part of the marketing authorisation that a risk management system designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks related to ATMPs, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of that system, be set up, or that specific post-marketing studies be carried out by the holder of the marketing authorisation and submitted for review to the EMA.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of any risk management system and the results of any studies performed shall be included in the periodic safety update reports referred to in Article 24(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
The EMA shall forthwith inform the Commission if it finds that the marketing authorisation holder has failed to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraph 2.
Scientific advice
The applicant or holder of a marketing authorisation may request advice from the EMA on the design and conduct of pharmacovigilance and of the risk management system referred to in Article 14.
A 90 % reduction for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 65 % for other applicants shall apply to the fee for scientific advice payable to the EMA for any advice given in respect of ATMPs pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 57(1)(n) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
Scientific recommendation on advanced therapy classification
Any applicant developing a product based on genes, cells or tissues may request a scientific recommendation of the EMA with a view to determining whether the referred product falls, on scientific grounds, within the definition of an ATMP.

Summary 166:
type-approval regulation (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 on type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes common technical requirements for the type approval of motor vehicles and replacement parts, such as replacement pollution control devices, with regard to their emissions.
It lays down rules for in-service conformity, durability of pollution control devices, on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems, measurement of fuel consumption and accessibility of vehicle repair and maintenance information.
It sets out the requirements and tests for the implementation of these rules.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to vehicles of categories M1, M2, N1 and N2 as defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg.
At the manufacturer's request, type approval granted under this Regulation may be extended from vehicles covered by this Article to M1, M2, N1 and N2 vehicles as defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC with a reference mass not exceeding 2 840 kg and which meet the conditions laid down in this Regulation and its implementing measures.
Manufacturers’ obligations
Manufacturers must ensure that all new vehicles sold, registered or put into service in the European Union are type approved in accordance with this Regulation and its implementing measures. They must also demonstrate that all new replacement pollution control devices requiring type approval which are sold or put into service in the EU are type approved in accordance with this Regulation and its implementing measures.
Manufacturers must also ensure that type approval procedures for verifying conformity of production, durability of pollution control devices and in-service conformity are met.
Manufacturers must set out carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption figures in a document given to the purchaser of the vehicle at the time of purchase.
The specific procedures and requirements for the implementation of these obligations shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2).
Access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
Manufacturers must provide unrestricted and standardised access to vehicle repair and maintenance information to independent operators through websites using a standardised format in a readily accessible and prompt manner, and in a manner which is non-discriminatory compared to the provision given or access granted to authorised dealers and repairers.
Access to vehicle repair and maintenance information must include:
an unequivocal vehicle identification;
service handbooks;
technical manuals;
component and diagnosis information;
wiring diagrams;
diagnostic trouble codes;
the software calibration identification number applicable to a vehicle type;
information provided concerning, and delivered by means of, proprietary tools and equipment;
data record information and two-directional monitoring and test data.
Authorised dealers or repairers within the distribution system of a given vehicle manufacturer shall be regarded as independent operators for the purposes of this Regulation to the extent that they provide repair or maintenance services for vehicles in respect of which they are not members of the vehicle manufacturer's distribution system.
The vehicle repair and maintenance information shall always be available, except as required for maintenance purposes of the information system.
Manufacturers may charge reasonable and proportionate fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information covered by this Regulation; a fee is not reasonable or proportionate if it discourages access by failing to take into account the extent to which the independent operator uses it.
The measures necessary for implementation of Articles 6 and 7, which are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 15(3). This shall include the definition and updating of technical specifications relating to the way in which OBD and vehicle repair and maintenance information shall be provided, with special attention being paid to the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The vehicle repair and maintenance information shall always be available, except as required for maintenance purposes of the information system.
With effect from 2 July 2007, if a manufacturer so requests, the national authorities may not, on grounds relating to emissions or fuel consumption of vehicles, refuse to grant EC type approval or national type approval for a new type of vehicle, where the vehicle concerned complies with this Regulation and its implementing measures, and in particular with the Euro 5 limit values set out in Table 1 of Annex I or with the Euro 6 limit values set out in Table 2 of Annex I.
With effect from 1 September 2009, and from 1 September 2010 in the case of category N1 class II and III and category N2 vehicles, the national authorities shall refuse, on grounds relating to emissions or fuel consumption, to grant EC type approval or national type approval for new types of vehicle which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures, and in particular with the Annexes, with the exception of the Euro 6 limit values set out in Table 2 of Annex I. For the test on tailpipe emissions, the limit values applied to vehicles designed to fulfil specific social needs shall be the same as for category N1 class III vehicles.
With effect from 1 January 2011, and from 1 January 2012 in the case of category N1 class II and III and category N2 vehicles and vehicles designed to fulfil specific social needs, national authorities shall, in the case of new vehicles which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures, and in particular with the Annexes with the exception of the Euro 6 limit values set out in Table 2 of Annex I, consider certificates of conformity to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC and shall, on grounds relating to emissions or fuel consumption, prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of such vehicles. For the test on tailpipe emissions, the limit values applied to vehicles designed to fulfil specific social needs shall be the same as for category N1 class III vehicles.
With effect from 1 September 2014, and from 1 September 2015 in the case of category N1 class II and III and category N2 vehicles, the national authorities shall refuse, on grounds relating to emissions or fuel consumption, to grant EC type approval or national type approval for new types of vehicle which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures, and in particular with the Euro 6 limit values set out in Table 2 of Annex I.

Summary 167:
common procedure for food additives, enzymes and flavourings
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
The European Parliament and the Council have established a common authorisation procedure for food additives, enzymes and flavourings. This procedure is laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a common authorisation procedure for food additives, enzymes and flavourings in order to ensure the free movement of food within the European Union (EU) and a high level of protection of human health.
KEY POINTS
The common authorisation procedure comprises four main stages:
1.
the applicant sends the application to the European Commission;
2.
the Commission sends the application to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA);
3.
the Commission adopts a regulation implementing the update of the Community list of authorised substances;
4.
the Commission may decide not to proceed with a planned update.
The procedure may be started either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application. Applications may be made by a Member State or by an interested party, who may represent several interested parties. Applications shall be sent to the Commission.
The Commission shall seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), to be given in accordance with the procedure set out in the regulation. However, for the updates referred to in Article 2(2)(b) and (c) of the regulation, the Commission shall not be required to seek the opinion of the Authority if the updates in question are not liable to have an effect on human health.
The Commission shall submit to the Committee referred to in Article 14(1) of the regulation a draft regulation updating the Community list of authorised substances. The measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of the legislation on food additives, food enzymes and flavourings, relating to the removal of a substance from the Community list, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3) of the regulation.
On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny may be curtailed for the addition of substances to the Community lists and for adding, removing or changing conditions, specifications or restrictions associated with the presence of a substance on the Community lists.
The Commission shall submit to the Committee referred to in Article 14(1) of the regulation a draft regulation updating the Community list of authorised substances, taking account of the opinion of the Authority, any relevant provisions of EU law and any other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration.

Summary 168:
Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance
REGULATION (EC) No 765/2008 sets out the rules for accreditation and market surveillance in relation to the marketing of products.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a system of attestation by a national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised standards and, where applicable, any additional requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral schemes, to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity.
Accreditation is used on a compulsory or voluntary basis, whether that assessment is compulsory or not, and irrespective of the legal status of the body performing the accreditation.
Each Member State shall appoint a single national accreditation body.
Where a Member State considers that it is not economically meaningful or sustainable to have a national accreditation body or to provide certain accreditation services, it shall, as far as possible, have recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State.
A Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States where, in accordance with the above, recourse is had to the national accreditation body of another Member State.
Where accreditation is not operated directly by the public authorities themselves, a Member State shall entrust its national accreditation body with the operation of accreditation as a public authority activity and grant it formal recognition.
The responsibilities and tasks of the national accreditation body shall be clearly distinguished from those of other national authorities.
The national accreditation body shall operate on a not-for-profit basis.
The national accreditation body shall not offer or provide any activities or services that conformity assessment bodies provide, nor shall it provide consultancy services, own shares in or otherwise have a financial or managerial interest in a conformity assessment body.
Each Member State shall ensure that its national accreditation body has the appropriate financial and personnel resources for the proper performance of its tasks, including the fulfilment of special tasks, such as activities for European and international accreditation cooperation and activities that are required to support public policy and which are not self-financing.
The national accreditation body shall be a member of the body recognised under Article 14.
National accreditation bodies shall establish and maintain appropriate structures to ensure the effective and balanced involvement of all interested parties within both their organisations and the body recognised under Article 14.
A national accreditation body shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, evaluate whether that conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity. Where it is found to be competent, the national accreditation body shall issue an accreditation certificate to that effect.
Where a national accreditation body ascertains that a conformity assessment body which has received an accreditation certificate is no longer competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity or has committed a serious breach of its obligations, that accreditation body shall take all appropriate measures within a reasonable timeframe to restrict, suspend or withdraw the accreditation certificate.
Member States shall establish procedures for the resolution of appeals, including, where appropriate, legal remedies against accreditation decisions or the absence thereof.
National accreditation bodies shall not compete with conformity assessment bodies.
National accreditation bodies shall not compete with other national accreditation bodies.
National accreditation bodies shall be permitted to operate across national borders, within the territory of another Member State, either at the request of a conformity assessment body in the circumstances set out in Article 7(1), or, if they are asked to do so by a national accreditation body in accordance with Article 7(3), in cooperation with the national accreditation body of that Member State.
Where a conformity assessment body requests accreditation it shall do so with the national accreditation body of the Member State in which it is established or with the national accreditation body to which that Member State has had recourse in accordance with Article 4(2).
A national accreditation body may request another national accreditation body to carry out part of the assessment activity. In such a case, the accreditation certificate shall be issued by the requesting body.
A national accreditation body shall fulfil the following requirements:
it shall be organised in such a manner as to make it independent of the conformity assessment bodies it assesses and of commercial pressures, and to ensure that no conflicts of interest with conformity assessment bodies occur;
it shall be organised and operated so as to safeguard the objectivity and impartiality of its activities;
it shall ensure that each decision relating to the attestation of competence is taken by competent persons different from those who carried out the assessment;
it shall have adequate arrangements to safeguard the confidentiality of the information obtained;
it shall identify the conformity assessment activities for which it is competent to perform accreditation, referring, where appropriate, to relevant Community or national legislation and standards;
it shall set up the procedures necessary to ensure efficient management and appropriate internal controls;
it shall have a number of competent personnel at its disposal sufficient for the proper performance of its tasks;
it shall document the duties, responsibilities and authorities of personnel who could affect the quality of the assessment and of the attestation of competence;
it shall establish, implement and maintain procedures for monitoring the performance and competence of the personnel involved;
it shall verify that conformity assessments are carried out in an appropriate manner, meaning that unnecessary burdens are not imposed on undertakings and that due account is taken of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process;
it shall publish audited annual accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The European cooperation for Accreditation (the EA)
The European cooperation for Accreditation (the EA) is the first body recognised under this Regulation and Member States shall ensure that their national accreditation bodies seek and maintain membership of the EA for as long as it is so recognised.
The EA manages a peer evaluation system among national accreditation bodies from the Member States and other European countries. That system has proved to be efficient and to provide mutual confidence.
The EA shall:
develop and maintain a peer evaluation system for the purpose of assessing and monitoring the competence of national accreditation bodies;
organise, develop and maintain sectoral accreditation schemes;
develop and maintain a register of accredited conformity assessment bodies;
develop and maintain a register of national accreditation bodies;
develop and maintain a register of conformity assessment bodies;

Summary 170:
Rail passengers’ rights and obligations
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to strengthen passengers’ rights in the EU rail transport sector. It sets out a common set of rules for the rights and obligations of passengers and railway undertakings.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all rail journeys and services throughout the EU provided by one or more railway undertakings licensed in accordance with Directive 95/18/EC (see summary).
It does not apply to railway undertakings and transport services which are not licensed under that Directive.
It applies to all rail passenger services throughout the EU, except for urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services, unless an exemption has been granted by a Member State.
A Member State may grant an exemption for a maximum period of 5 years for domestic rail passenger services or particular services or journeys because a significant part of the rail passenger service, including at least one scheduled station stop, is operated outside the EU.
The regulation does not apply to railway undertakings and transport services which are not licensed under Directive 95/18/EC.
Information and tickets
Railway undertakings and ticket vendors offering transport contracts on behalf of one or more railway undertakings must provide the passenger, upon request, with at least the information set out in Annex II, Part I in relation to the journeys for which a transport contract is offered by the railway undertaking concerned.
Ticket vendors offering transport contracts on their own account, and tour operators, must provide this information where available.
During the journey, railway undertakings must provide the passenger with at least the information set out in Annex II, Part II.
Railway undertakings and ticket vendors must offer, where available, tickets, through tickets and reservations.
Liability for passengers and luggage
The liability of railway undertakings in respect of passengers and their luggage is governed by Chapters I, III and IV of Title IV, Title VI and Title VII of Annex I.
The obligation set out in Article 9 of Directive 95/18/EC as far as it relates to liability for passengers shall be understood as requiring a railway undertaking to be adequately insured or to make equivalent arrangements for cover of its liabilities under this Regulation.
Delays, missed connections and cancellations
The liability of railway undertakings in respect of delays, missed connections and cancellations is governed by Chapter II of Title IV of Annex I.
Where it is reasonably to be expected that the delay in the arrival at the final destination under the transport contract will be more than 60 minutes, the passenger shall immediately have the choice between:
reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket, under the conditions by which it was paid, for the part or parts of his or her journey not made and for the part or parts already made if the journey is no longer serving any purpose in relation to the passenger’s original travel plan, together with, when relevant, a return service to the first point of departure at the earliest opportunity;
continuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at the earliest opportunity; or
continuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at a later date at the passenger’s convenience.
Compensation for delays
Without losing the right of transport, a passenger may request compensation for delays from the railway undertaking if he or she is facing a delay between the places of departure and destination stated on the ticket for which the ticket has not been reimbursed in accordance with Article 16. The minimum compensations for delays shall be as follows:
25 % of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes;
50 % of the ticket price for a delay of 120 minutes or more.
Passengers who hold a travel pass or season ticket and who encounter recurrent delays or cancellations during its period of validity may request adequate compensation in accordance with the railway undertaking’s compensation arrangements. These arrangements shall state the criteria for determining delay and for the calculation of the compensation.
Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility
Railway undertakings and station managers shall, with the active involvement of representative organisations of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, establish, or shall have in place, non-discriminatory access rules for the transport of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
Reservations and tickets shall be offered to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility at no additional cost. A railway undertaking, ticket vendor or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation from, or issue a ticket to, a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, or require that such person be accompanied by another person, unless this is strictly necessary in order to comply with the access rules referred to in the first paragraph.
Upon request, a railway undertaking, a ticket vendor or a tour operator shall provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility with information on the accessibility of rail services and on the access conditions of rolling stock in accordance with the access rules referred to in the first paragraph and shall inform disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility about facilities on board.
Railway undertakings, station managers, ticket vendors and tour operators shall cooperate in order to provide assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility in line with Articles 22 and 23 in accordance with the following points:
assistance shall be provided on condition that the railway undertaking, the station manager, the ticket vendor or the tour operator with which the ticket was purchased is notified of the person’s disability or reduced mobility;
the railway undertaking, the station manager, the ticket vendor or the tour operator shall accept a written declaration from the passenger that he or she is disabled or has reduced mobility;
the railway undertaking, the station manager, the ticket vendor or the tour operator shall accept a certificate issued by a doctor or other appropriate health professional, which is no more than 12 months old, that the passenger is disabled or has reduced mobility;
the railway undertaking, the station manager, the ticket vendor or the tour operator shall accept a certificate issued by a doctor or other appropriate health professional, which is no more than 12 months old, that the passenger is disabled or has reduced mobility and that the facilities or services requested are necessary for the person’s disability or reduced mobility.
Assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility
On departure from, transit through or arrival at, a staffed railway station of a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, the station manager shall provide assistance free of charge in such a way that that person is able to board the departing service, or to disembark from the arriving service for which he or she purchased a ticket.
In unstaffed stations, railway undertakings and station managers shall ensure that easily accessible information is displayed in accordance with the access rules regarding the nearest staffed stations and directly available assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
Railway undertakings shall provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility assistance free of charge on board a train and during boarding and disembarking from a train.

EU statistics on aquaculture
EU statistics on aquaculture
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 762/2008 on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the collection of statistics on the production and structure of the European Union’s (EU) aquaculture sector.
KEY POINTS
The EU’s aquaculture sector is a major contributor to the EU’s fisheries production. It is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, providing the EU with a large share of its fish consumption. It is therefore essential that the sector is properly monitored and managed.
The regulation sets out the rules for the collection of statistics on the production and structure of the EU’s aquaculture sector. The data are collected from national authorities responsible for the sector and submitted to the European Commission (Eurostat) on an annual basis.
Production
The regulation covers the following:
the annual production (volume and unit value) of aquaculture;
the annual input (volume and unit value) to capture-based aquaculture;
the annual production of hatcheries and nurseries;
the structure of the aquaculture sector.
The regulation covers the whole of the EU’s territory, including territorial waters, and inland waters such as lakes and rivers.
The data are collected from national authorities responsible for the sector and submitted to the Commission (Eurostat) on an annual basis. The first reference calendar year is 2008. The data are submitted within 12 months of the end of the reference calendar year.
The Commission (Eurostat) publishes the statistics in its online database.
Structure
The regulation also covers the structure of the sector. The data are collected from national authorities responsible for the sector and submitted to the Commission (Eurostat) on an annual basis. The first reference calendar year is 2008. The data are submitted within 12 months of the end of the reference calendar year.
The Commission (Eurostat) publishes the statistics in its online database.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2009.
BACKGROUND
              
The regulation repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 788/96 on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture production. That regulation required the Member States to submit annual data on the volume of production.
The increasing contribution of aquaculture to the EU’s total fisheries production requires a wider range of data for a rational development and management of this sector within the Common Fisheries Policy.
The regulation also covers the production of hatcheries and nurseries for aquaculture activity.
The regulation was adopted in 2008, following the adoption of the new Common Fisheries Policy in 2009.
For more information, see:
EU aquaculture production (Eurostat).
KEY TERMS
              
Aquaculture: the breeding, rearing and reproduction of aquatic animals and plants under controlled conditions.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2009.

EU Ecolabel — a new label for the environment
EU Ecolabel — a new label for the environment
The EU Ecolabel is a voluntary eco-label for products that meet high environmental standards. It was created in 2000 by Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. This Regulation repeals the previous one and introduces changes to the EU Ecolabel scheme.
ACT
Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the EU Ecolabel.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a revised EU Ecolabel scheme which is intended to promote products with a reduced environmental impact during their entire life cycle and to provide consumers with accurate, non-deceptive, science-based information on the environmental impact of products.
KEY POINTS
The EU Ecolabel may be used by operators (manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, retailers) who have been awarded the EU Ecolabel and comply with the EU Ecolabel criteria and the assessment requirements published by the European Commission.
EU Ecolabel criteria
EU Ecolabel criteria shall be based on the environmental performance of products, taking into account the latest strategic objectives of the Community in the field of the environment.
EU Ecolabel criteria shall set out the environmental requirements that a product must fulfil in order to bear the EU Ecolabel.
EU Ecolabel criteria shall be determined on a scientific basis considering the whole life cycle of products.
For specific categories of goods containing substances referred to in Article 6(6) of this Regulation, the Commission may adopt measures to grant derogations from Article 6(6). No derogation shall be given concerning substances that meet the criteria of Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and that are identified according to the procedure described in Article 59(1) of that Regulation, present in mixtures, in an article or in any homogeneous part of a complex article in concentrations higher than 0,1 % (weight by weight).
Development and revision of EU Ecolabel criteria
The Commission may initiate and lead the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria.
The Commission shall, no later than nine months after consulting the EUEB, adopt measures to establish specific EU Ecolabel criteria for each product group.
Award of the EU Ecolabel and terms and conditions of its use
The EU Ecolabel shall have the form depicted in Annex II of this Regulation.
The EU Ecolabel may only be used in connection with products complying with the EU Ecolabel criteria applicable to the products concerned and for which the EU Ecolabel has been awarded.
Applications shall specify the full contact details of the operator, as well as the product group in question and shall contain a full description of the product as well as all other information requested by the competent body.
The competent body to which an application is made shall charge fees according to Annex III of this Regulation. The use of the EU Ecolabel shall be conditional upon the fees having been paid in due time.
Market surveillance and control of the use of the EU Ecolabel
The competent body shall, in respect of products to which it has awarded the EU Ecolabel, verify that the product complies with the EU Ecolabel criteria and assessment requirements published under Article 8, on a regular basis.
The user of the EU Ecolabel shall, upon request by the competent body which has awarded the EU Ecolabel to the product, grant access to the premises on which the product concerned is produced.
The competent body which finds that a product bearing the EU Ecolabel does not comply with the relevant product group criteria or that the EU Ecolabel is not used in accordance with Article 9, shall either prohibit the use of the EU Ecolabel on that product, or, in the event that the EU Ecolabel has been awarded by another competent body, it shall inform that competent body. The user of the EU Ecolabel shall not be entitled to repayment of the fees referred to in Article 9(4), either in whole or in part.
Promotion of the EU Ecolabel
Member States and the Commission shall, in cooperation with the EUEB, agree on a specific action plan to promote the use of the EU Ecolabel by:
awareness-raising actions and information and public education campaigns for consumers, producers, manufacturers, wholesalers, service providers, public purchasers, traders, retailers and the general public,
encouraging the uptake of the scheme, especially for SMEs,
thus supporting the development of the scheme.
Promotion of the EU Ecolabel may be undertaken via the EU Ecolabel website providing basic information and promotional materials on the EU Ecolabel, and information on where to purchase EU Ecolabel products, in all Community languages.
Member States shall encourage the use of the ‘Manual for authorities awarding public contracts’, as specified in Annex I, Part A, point 5. For this purpose, Member States shall consider, for example, the setting of targets for the purchasing of products meeting the criteria specified in that Manual.
Exchange of information and experiences
Competent bodies shall regularly exchange information and experiences, in particular on the application of Articles 9 and 10.
The Commission shall set up a working group of competent bodies for this purpose. The working group shall meet at least twice a year. Travel expenses shall be borne by the Commission.
