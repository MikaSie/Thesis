 Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 on the harmonisation of markets in financial instruments
SUMMARY
The Capital Markets Union (CMU) project aims to create a single market for capital in the European Union (EU) in order to provide businesses with the finance they need to develop and create jobs. This Regulation aims to establish a harmonised approach to marketing communications for both alternative investment funds (AIFs) and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). It also aims to address the issue of the cross-border distribution of such funds.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out requirements for marketing communications addressed to investors in AIFs and UCITS.
It also establishes common principles concerning fees or charges for supervisory and investigatory powers for competent authorities, and a central database for cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS.
It sets out rules on pre-marketing for qualifying venture capital funds and qualifying social entrepreneurship funds.
KEY POINTS
Marketing communications
Marketing communications addressed to investors in AIFs and UCITS must be identifiable as such and describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or UCITS in an equally prominent manner. They must also include information on the risks and rewards of such investment in a prominent manner.
In addition, all information included in marketing communications addressed to investors must be presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading. To ensure a level playing field between AIFs and UCITS, the standards for marketing communications apply to marketing communications of AIFs and UCITS.
Common principles concerning fees or charges
By 2 February 2020, competent authorities must publish and maintain up-to-date information on their websites listing the fees or charges levied by the competent authorities for supervision of cross-border activities.
ESMA central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:
all AIFs that are marketed in a Member State other than the home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed; and
all UCITS that are marketed in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed.
The database must be kept up to date.
Ex-ante verification of marketing communications
AIFMs, EuVECA managers, EuSEF managers and UCITS management companies must ensure that all marketing communications addressed to investors are identifiable as such and describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or units of a UCITS in an equally prominent manner, and that all information included in marketing communications is fair, clear and not misleading.
By 2 February 2021, ESMA must issue guidelines, and thereafter update those guidelines periodically, on the application of the requirements for marketing communications, taking into account on-line aspects of such marketing communications.
By 2 February 2021, competent authorities must publish on their websites the hyperlinks to the websites of competent authorities where the information referred to in the first paragraph of this point is published.
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:
all AIFs that are marketed in a Member State other than the home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed; and
all UCITS that are marketed in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State as defined in point (e) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, their UCITS management company and the Member States in which they are marketed.
The database must be kept up to date.
Pre-marketing
A manager of a qualifying venture capital fund may engage in pre-marketing in the Union, except where the information presented to potential investors:
is sufficient to allow investors to commit to acquiring units or shares of a particular qualifying venture capital fund;
amounts to subscription forms or similar documents whether in a draft or a final form; or
amounts to constitutional documents, a prospectus or offering documents of a not-yet-established qualifying venture capital fund in a final form.
By 2 February 2021, ESMA must issue guidelines, and thereafter update those guidelines periodically, on the application of the requirements for pre-marketing, taking into account on-line aspects of such pre-marketing.
By 2 February 2021, competent authorities must publish on their websites the hyperlinks to the websites of competent authorities where the information referred to in the first paragraph of this point is published.
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:

Summary 2:
 Facilitating the provision of online services and retransmissions of television and radio programmes
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It establishes a legal framework for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
KEY POINTS
This directive establishes a legal framework for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
It facilitates the provision of online services for certain types of programmes, such as news and current affairs programmes, and for certain types of programmes produced by a broadcaster, such as a broadcaster’s own productions which are exclusively financed by it.
It lays down rules for the transmission of programmes through the process of direct injection, which is a technical process by which a broadcaster transmits its programme-carrying signals to an organisation other than a broadcaster, in such a way that the programme-carrying signals are not accessible to the public during that transmission.
It simplifies the clearance of rights for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across borders.
It allows agreements concluded between a collective management organisation and operators of retransmission services for rights that are subject to mandatory collective management under this directive to be extended to apply to the rights of rightholders who are not represented by that collective management organisation, without those rightholders being allowed to exclude their works or other subject matter from the application of that mechanism.
It does not oblige broadcasters to provide online services across borders or to retransmit programmes originating in other EU countries.
It is without prejudice to the contractual freedom of rightholders and broadcasting organisations to agree, in compliance with EU law, to limit the exploitation of their rights, including those under Directive 2001/29/EC.
It is without prejudice to the right of broadcasters to communicate to the public or make available to the public programmes in their online services or to provide such online services in a Member State other than the Member State of their principal establishment.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
It applies from 7 June 2021.
BACKGROUND
The digital revolution has transformed the way in which television and radio programmes are distributed and accessed. Users increasingly expect to have access to television and radio programmes through traditional channels, such as satellite or cable, and also through online services.
This directive aims to facilitate the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
For further information, please see the European Commission's website on the ‘digital single market’.
KEY TERMS
              
Broadcasting organisation: a body which transmits television and radio programmes intended for reception by the public.
Direct injection: a technical process by which a broadcasting organisation transmits its programme-carrying signals to an organisation other than a broadcasting organisation, in such a way that the programme-carrying signals are not accessible to the public during that transmission.
Ancillary online service: an online service which provides access to television and radio programmes in a strictly linear manner, simultaneously to the broadcast, and services that give access, within a defined time period after the broadcast, to television and radio programmes which have been previously broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, so-called ‘catch-up services’.
Retransmission: the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission by a cable or microwave system for reception by the public of an initial transmission from another Member State, by wire or over the air, including that by satellite, of television or radio programmes intended for reception by the public.

 Regulation (EU) 2019/1831 — the.eu country code top-level domain
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the.eu country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU) and its variants in other scripts, in order to support the digital single market, to build an online EU identity and to encourage cross-border online activities.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all domain names registered under the.eu ccTLD.
The registration of domain names under the.eu ccTLD can be requested by any of the following:
a citizen of the EU, regardless of their place of residence;
a natural person who is not an EU citizen and who is a resident of an EU country;
an undertaking established in the EU;
an organisation established in the EU.
A domain name may be registered or reserved by the EU countries for their operational functions. The EU countries may also register or reserve domain names for broadly recognised geographical or geopolitical terms that affect their political or territorial organisation.
The regulation sets out the principles and procedures for the registration of domain names and the conditions for the implementation of the.eu ccTLD.
The regulation establishes the conditions for the designation and characteristics of the registry, which manages the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must be a not-for-profit organisation and must have its registered office, central administration and principal place of business within the EU.
The registry must comply with the EU data protection rules, principles and guidelines.
The registry must cooperate with the European Union Intellectual Property Office and other EU agencies with a view to combating the speculative and abusive registrations of domain names, including cyber squatting, and providing simple administrative procedures, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The registry must adopt clear policies aiming to ensure the timely identification of abusive registrations of domain names and, where necessary, should cooperate with competent authorities and other public bodies relevant to cybersecurity and information security which are specifically involved in the fight against such registrations, such as national computer emergency response teams (CERTs).
The registry must provide domain holders with the possibility of transferring their domain names to another holder in accordance with the principles and procedures on the functioning of the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must set up and manage, with due diligence, a WHOIS database facility for the purpose of ensuring the security, stability and resilience of the.eu ccTLD by providing accurate and up-to-date registration information about the domain names under the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must be designated by the European Commission following a selection procedure.
The Commission may request information from the registry to ensure that the principles and procedures on the functioning of the.eu ccTLD are respected.
The Commission may convey specific instructions to the registry for correcting or improving the organisation, administration and management of the.eu ccTLD.
The Commission may consult the.eu Multistakeholder Advisory Group and other relevant stakeholders and may seek expert advice on the results of the supervisory activities provided for in this regulation and on ways to improve the organisation, administration and management of the.eu ccTLD by the registry.
The regulation sets out the conditions for the supervision of the registry by the Commission.
The Commission shall designate an entity as the registry following the completion of the procedure referred to in the regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 19 October 2019.
BACKGROUND
The rapid evolution of the TLD market and the dynamic digital landscape require a future-proof and flexible regulatory environment.
The.eu ccTLD is one of the largest ccTLDs. The.eu ccTLD is used by the EU institutions, agencies and bodies, including for European projects and initiatives. The purpose of the.eu ccTLD is, through good management, to help enhance the EU identity and promote EU values online, such as multilingualism, respect for users' privacy and security and respect for human rights, as well as specific online priorities.
The regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 733/2002 to allow EU citizens to register a.eu ccTLD name, regardless of their place of residence, from 19 October 2019.

Summary 12:
 interoperability of electronic road toll systems
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It aims to ensure that electronic road toll systems in the European Union (EU) are interoperable and that the cross-border enforcement of the obligation to pay road fees is facilitated.
KEY POINTS
Road fees are fees that users pay to use a specific road infrastructure or a specific vehicle access regulation scheme.
The EU already ensures the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the EU through the Eurovignette. The Eurovignette is a sticker that drivers of vehicles registered in the EU must display on their vehicles when driving on certain roads in other EU countries.
The Eurovignette is based on the principle of user pays, which means that the user of a service pays for it.
The Eurovignette was initially intended to cover only motorways and other roads with heavy traffic. However, it has since been extended to cover other roads and has become a way to finance the construction and maintenance of the road network.
The Eurovignette also applies to certain urban vehicle access regulation schemes such as low emission zones and restricted access zones.
The directive does not apply to parking fees.
The directive applies to electronic road toll systems which require the installation or use of on-board equipment (OBE).
The directive does not apply to road toll systems which are not electronic within the meaning of point 10 of Article 2 of the directive.
The directive applies to small, strictly local road toll systems for which the costs of compliance with the requirements of Articles 3 to 22 would be disproportionate to the benefits.

Summary 19:
 Ensuring security of gas supply in the EU
SUMMARY
The EU has adopted a new regulation on security of gas supply. The aim is to ensure that gas is available in sufficient quantities for all EU citizens, businesses and industries at all times. The new rules complement existing legislation, which already requires EU countries to take certain preventive and mitigation measures to ensure security of gas supply.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It establishes a framework for EU countries to assess and manage risks to the security of gas supply. It also sets out a system of solidarity between EU countries in the event of a severe gas crisis.
KEY POINTS
The regulation covers both the prevention and the mitigation of risks to the security of gas supply. It sets out preventive action plans, emergency plans and an emergency response mechanism.
The preventive action plans include actions to:
increase gas storage capacity;
diversify gas supply routes;
enable bi-directional capacity on interconnection points.
The emergency plans include measures to:
introduce non-market-based measures;
reduce gas demand;
provide gas to solidarity protected customers;
introduce market-based measures;
use gas from LNG terminals.
EU countries must also:
cooperate with each other and with the European Commission to identify and manage risks;
adopt preventive and mitigation measures;
notify the Commission of any serious gas crisis;
take steps to ensure that gas is available in sufficient quantities for all EU citizens, businesses and industries at all times;
provide for the security of gas supply of customers in the territory of the EU.
The regulation provides for a solidarity mechanism between EU countries. This means that in the event of a severe gas crisis, EU countries that are not affected by the crisis will supply gas to those that are. The regulation also establishes a common risk assessment mechanism and a permanent reserve list for a monitoring task force.
EU countries must adopt the necessary measures to ensure that gas is supplied to solidarity protected customers in the requesting EU country in accordance with the regulation.
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 994/2010.
WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 May 2017.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted several pieces of legislation on the security of gas supply, including the Gas Directive (2003/55/EC) and the Gas Security of Supply Regulation (2004/682/EC).

Improving the quality of consumer price indices
Improving the quality of consumer price indices
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish a common framework for the production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at both national and EU level.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at national level;
the HICP at EU level;
the harmonised indices of consumer prices for the purposes of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure.
Scope of the harmonised indices
The harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) are based on observed prices, which include taxes on products. The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. The OOH price index is based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure for owner-occupied housing (OOH). The HPI is a necessary basis for compiling the OOH price index.
The regulation does not cover transactions between households, except in the case of rentals paid by tenants to private landlords, where the latter act as market producers of services purchased by households (tenants).
The HICP and the HICP-CT are broken down into categories of the European classification of individual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP).
The OOH price index and the HPI are broken down into categories of the European classification of individual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP).
Calculation of the indices
The HICP and the HICP-CT are calculated using the Laspeyres-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of a period (b) prior to the price reference period, and are adjusted to reflect the prices of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
The OOH price index is calculated using the Paasche-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
The HPI is calculated using the Fisher-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of a period (b) prior to the price reference period, and are adjusted to reflect the prices of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
Production of the indices
The indices are produced by the Member States. The HICP and the HICP-CT are produced at least once a month. The HPI is produced at least once a quarter. The OOH price index is produced at least once a year.
Quality of the indices
The quality of the indices produced is ensured by the Member States. The European Commission (Eurostat) verifies the sources and methods used by Member States to calculate the indices.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 13 June 2016.

EU anti-dumping regulation
EU anti-dumping regulation
The EU has adopted an anti-dumping (AD) system that aims to protect the EU market from dumped imports. The EU has adopted an anti-dumping (AD) system that aims to protect the EU market from dumped imports. It is one of the most important tools in the EU’s trade defence system, which also includes a system for safeguarding and a system for countering subsidies and dumping.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down the rules for investigating whether imports into the EU are dumped and whether they cause injury to the domestic industry.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down the rules for investigating whether imports into the EU are dumped and whether they cause injury to the domestic industry. It also establishes the procedures for imposing duties on such imports.
A product is considered to be dumped if its export price is less than the normal value of a like product, in the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country.
The normal value may be established on the basis of prices of other sellers or producers in the exporting country, or, in certain circumstances, in another country.
An investigation may be initiated by the Commission, on its own initiative or following a complaint from a producer or association of producers in the EU. It may also be initiated following a request from a Member State.
The Commission is assisted in its work by a committee which meets at least once a year.
The Commission may impose provisional duties on imports from countries suspected of dumping, if it considers that there is sufficient evidence to justify such duties.
It may also accept undertakings from exporters to revise their prices or to cease exports at dumped prices.
The Commission may also decide to terminate a case without applying duties or to impose definitive duties.
Duties are imposed in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis, on imports from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury.
Duties may be imposed for a period of 5 years at the most. They may be extended in exceptional circumstances.
Duties may be imposed only on imports from exporters or producers which have made themselves known in accordance with the regulation, unless they have accepted an undertaking.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 30 May 2016.

 Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 on protection against subsidised imports from third countries
Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 establishes the rules for the application of countervailing measures against subsidised imports from third countries. These measures consist in the imposition of duties on imports of a product from a country, or from a group of countries, which are found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the producers of like products in the European Union.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for the application of countervailing measures against subsidised imports from third countries. These measures consist in the imposition of duties on imports of a product from a country, or from a group of countries, which are found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the producers of like products in the European Union.
KEY POINTS
Subsidies
A subsidy is a financial contribution by a government or public body which confers a benefit on certain undertakings or products. These subsidies may be granted directly by the government or indirectly through state-owned enterprises.
A subsidy is considered countervailable if it is specific, that is, it is limited in extent or available only to certain enterprises, or contingent in nature, that is, it is tied to export performance or the use of domestic over imported goods.
If a subsidy is found to be countervailable, the European Commission may decide to initiate an investigation into whether the subsidised imports cause injury to the European Union industry and whether the injury is due to the subsidisation. The Commission then imposes a countervailing duty on the imports from the country or countries concerned.
The Commission may also decide to terminate the investigation without imposing a countervailing duty in the following cases:
if the amount of countervailable subsidies is de minimis, that is, it is less than 5 % of the value of imports of the like product from all third countries during the investigation period;
if the volume of subsidised imports is negligible, that is, it is less than 3 % of the total imports of the like product in the European Union;
if the volume of subsidised imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible.
In order to determine whether a subsidy is countervailable, the Commission may ask for information from the European Union industry, from the country or countries concerned, as well as from any interested party in the European Union or in the country or countries concerned.
The Commission must inform the Member States of any request for information and provide them with copies of the questionnaire.
The Commission must publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union within 45 days of the date on which the complaint was lodged.
The Commission must reject a complaint where it considers that there is insufficient evidence to justify proceeding with the case.
The Commission may decide to accept an undertaking offered by the exporter or the country concerned that eliminates or offsets the countervailable subsidies and injury instead of imposing a countervailing duty.
The Commission may decide to terminate the investigation without imposing a countervailing duty in the following cases:

The Commission must impose a countervailing duty on imports from all sources found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the European Union industry.
The Commission may decide to increase the countervailing duty in order to achieve the price increase required to remove injury.
The Commission may decide to suspend the countervailing duties in cases where the European Union interest calls for intervention.
