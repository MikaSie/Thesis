Cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings — cross-border marketing of collective investments (AIFs) and UCITS (Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014)
Transparency and investor protection: cross-cutting rules on marketing communications for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) in the European Union (EU).
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2011/61/EU on the European Investment Funds Directive (see summary);
Regulation 2011/65/EC on collective investment* undertakings (See summary).
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
Directives 2011/60/EU and 2011/64/EC set out rules on the cross-fostering of collective investing undertakings in the EU (known as collective investment funds) and Regulation (EC) No 1095/2010 on the distribution of alternative investment funds.
The new rules aim to ensure that marketing communications to investors are clearly identifiable as such, and to describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or UCITS in an equally prominent manner.
Regulations (EC, EC, ESMA) 2019/1156 and 2019/1286 introduce new rules for marketing communications.
KEY POINTS
The rules apply to marketing communications of AIFs, including:
marketing communications addressed to investors in a collective investment undertaking (collective investment undertaking) which is managed by a management company (a collective investment company) or by an investment manager (i.e. a company that manages collective investment assets);
communications addressed to retail investors (e.g. investors who buy units of an investment unit of an alternative investment fund) which are marketed to them;
communications to investors who purchase units of a UCITS that are marketed directly to them.
EU countries must ensure that the marketing communications are clearly identified as such and that they contain the following information:
the AIFM, the EuVECA manager, EuSEF manager or the UCITS management company has the right to terminate the arrangements made for marketing.
Marketing communications must contain a description of the AIF’s investment objectives, the risks associated with the investment and the potential rewards of the investment, the investment is likely to entail and the information on the rights of investors.
Investors must also be informed of the rights and obligations of the management company and of the EU country in which the marketing communication is to be placed.
In addition, all information included in marketing communications must be presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading.
Marketing communications must specify where, how and in which language investors can obtain summarised information on investor rights and they must clearly state that:
investors have the right of withdrawal from the marketing agreement;
the management company may terminate the agreement if it does not fulfil the obligations of its management company;
investor rights may be terminated at any time by the investment manager or by the investor if the investment management company fails to fulfil its obligations under the terms of the agreement.
National authorities must publish a central database containing information on national laws and regulations and administrative provisions applicable to marketing communication on their websites in, as a minimum, a language customary in the sphere of international finance, including their non-official summaries. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) must also publish such summaries on its website.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 1 July 2019. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2021.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance, market surveillance* and control of products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that all products on the EU market comply with EU harmonisation legislation and therefore fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety in general, protection of consumers, the environment, public security and protection of any other public interests protected by that legislation.
KEY POINTS
Scope

It does not apply to products manufactured in non-EU countries.
EU countries must ensure that the products covered by the regulation are placed on the market by the competent authorities of the EU country in which they are manufactured and that they comply with the relevant EU legislation. They must inform the European Commission of any products that do not comply with this regulation and inform the Commission of the reasons for this.
The Commission has the authority responsible for enforcing the regulation and the European Rapid Information Exchange System (RAPEXEX), which allows EU countries to exchange information on products placed on their territory. The Commission may also use the Rapid Information System to detect and prevent the placing on the European Union market of products which are not complying with the regulation.
National authorities must cooperate with each other in order to identify products that may be a threat to public health, safety or the environment. They may also cooperate with the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED) and with other organisations representing economic operators or end users.
In addition, EU countries must cooperate in the event of the placing of a product on the territory of an EU country that does not fulfil the requirements of the legislation. If a product is found to be a risk to the public or to the economy, the national authorities must take the necessary measures to remove the product from the market.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND OF THE DECISION?
The regulation aims to ensure that all the necessary measures are taken to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of natural gas throughout the EU, in particular to protected customers, in case of difficult climatic conditions or disruptions of the natural gas supply.
The decision concludes the communication on behalf of the Commission.
KEY POINTS
Scope
This regulation applies to all EU countries, the EU countries and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. It does not apply to the countries which are not members of the Energy Union (TFEU).
It applies to:
EU countries’ national emergency plans and national preventive action plans;

SUMDARY
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the regulation. It is assisted by the European Parliament and the Council.
Energy security is one of the main objectives of the energy union. It aims to boost solidarity and trust between the Member States and put in place the measures needed to achieve those aims. It also aims to reduce the impact of gas disruptions on the EU economy and the social impact on vulnerable groups of customers.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission must:
ensure that:
the gas market operates smoothly and efficiently;
there is no disruption of the internal market for natural gas;
gas supply is guaranteed to be uninterrupted throughout the entire EU, even if there is a partial or complete interruption of the supply from Russia;
all EU countries have the necessary infrastructure to guarantee uninterrupted gas supply to the EU and the EEA countries;
when a gas supply disruption is threatened, EU countries must take all necessary measures to guarantee that the gas market functions smoothly and smoothly;
coordination between the Commission and the other EU countries is in place to ensure the proper functioning of the market;
in the event that the market does not function smoothly and the market is not distorted, the national authorities must ensure that the Commission has the information it needs to make the necessary decisions;
if the market fails to function smoothly or if a gas shortage does occur, it must inform the Commission of the reasons for the failure to operate smoothly and inform the public of the consequences of the failure.
If the Commission considers that the situation is likely to deteriorate, it may decide to suspend or reduce the gas supply for a period of time to allow the market to operate more smoothly. If the market continues to function normally, it will be possible to restore gas supply and the Commission will be able to assess the extent to which the market has been affected.

Protection of EU consumers from subsidised imported goods (subsidy and anti-dumping measures).
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down the rules for the protection of consumers from imports of agricultural products from countries outside the EU (‘non-EU’) by means of a countervailable duty.
It codifies and clarifies the rules governing the application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), the Agreement on Agriculture (Agreement on Agriculture) and an Agreement on Subsidies.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the conditions under which EU countries may impose countervailed duties on imports of certain agricultural products originating from non–EU countries. It also defines the types of imports covered by the GATT 1994 and the agreement on agriculture.
Countervailable imports are those that are deemed to have caused material injury or are threatening to cause injury to an EU industry by:
providing a financial contribution by a government or a public body within the territory of a country, or
requiring some form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the Subsidewinds of the WTO Agreement on subsidies and the Agreement of the same type,
using a benchmark to determine the amount of the subsidy to be calculated by adjusting the terms and conditions prevailing in the country concerned on the basis of actual factors available in that country.
The EU country concerned must notify the European Commission of the volume and price levels of the imports concerned and the information on the EU industry’s interests.
If the Commission considers that the imports are causing injury, it may impose duties on the imports. The Commission must inform the EU countries of the reasons for its decision.
Importers must provide the Commission with all the information necessary to determine whether the imports have caused injury or have threatened to do so. It must also inform the Commission of any other information that may be relevant to the determination of whether a subsidy is to be declared to exist.
In the event that the Commission concludes that a subsidy does not exist, the Commission may impose a duty on the import of the imported goods. The duty may be imposed on imports originating in the EU or originating in a non-European Economic Area (EEA) country. It may also be imposed in the case of imports originating outside the EEA if the imports originate in a country that is not a party to the agreement.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
Regulation(EU) 2017/1036 has applied since 1 July 2017.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a number of measures to ensure that EU consumers are protected from the effects of imports of subsidised agricultural products. These include:

Summary 28:
Pre-accession assistance (IPA III) for EU countries in the process of joining the European Union (EU)
Pre-Accession assistance for EU governments in the period 2021-2027
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, 2021/1529 — establishing the Instrument for Pre-Entryion assistance
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the EU’s instrument for pre-entry assistance for countries which have applied to join the EU.
It aims to provide incentives and guidance to the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to pursue the necessary far-reaching reforms.
KEY POINTS
Annex I covers the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027.
Beneficiaries are selected by the European Commission on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TEU).
The Commission assesses each applicant country on its ability to meet the Copenhagen criteria. The criteria include: the stability of institutions which guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU, and the ability to assume not only the rights but also the obligations under the Treaties, including the pursuit of the aims of political, economic and monetary union.
Each applicant country is assessed on its own merits. The assessment of progress achieved and the identification of shortcomings is carried out by the Commission. The Commission then forwards the results of the assessment to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (EEASC). The EEC then adopts a recommendation on whether the applicant country should apply for EU membership.
The EEC adopts the EEC recommendation on behalf of the EEU. The EASC adopts an opinion on the application of the Member State to apply for the EU membership of the Union. The decision is binding on the Member States and on the Commission, which must then adopt a decision on whether or not to grant accession to the country.
In the event of a country not meeting the criteria, the Commission may grant the country accession if it is able to:
ensure that the necessary reforms are in place;
promote the principles of democracy and human rights;
improve the functioning of the judicial system; and
establish a free movement of goods, services and capital within the territory of the country concerned.
If a country does not meet the criteria for accession, it may apply for an extension of the period of the instrument for a period of 5 years. The period of extension may be renewed if the country meets the following criteria:
strengthen democracy, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and respect of human rights, including protection of persons belonging to minorities, and is committed to promoting those values;
increase the participation of women in the political and economic life of the population;
encourage the creation of a free market economy;
develop the capacity of the private sector to compete in international markets;
establish an effective system of taxation;
implement a system of public procurement;
facilitate the transfer of goods and services between the private and public sectors;
support the establishment of a single market economy.
A country may be granted accession only if it:
has met all the criteria established by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 (the ‘Copenhagen criteria’) and provided that the EU has the capability to integrate the new member into its internal market;
has adopted a comprehensive package of economic and social reforms that are compatible with the objectives of the enlargement policy;
is able to assume the obligations laid down in Article 21 of the TEU, including those relating to political, monetary and fiscal union;
ensures the protection and promotion of fundamental rights and principles;
provides the protection of the rights of minorities;
maintains the independence of the judiciary and the independence and impartiality of the police and judicial authorities;
contains the necessary resources to implement its reform process;
recognises the importance of the involvement of civil society in the economic and political life of its country;
cooperates with other Member States in the implementation of its reforms;
fosters the development of good neighbourly relations with the countries listed in the annexes;
supports the efforts of the Commission to implement the common foreign and security policy of the Schengen area;
continues to support the work of the European Observatory for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (EOPCW) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the field of the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and in the area of the eradication of transnational organised crime (WCTs) in order to contribute to the prevention of WMD proliferation and the elimination of the WMDs in the region.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure that persons who work for a public or private organisation or are in contact with such an organisation in the context of their work-related activities are often the first to know about threats or harm to the public interest which arise in that context. By reporting breaches of European Union (EU)* law, such persons act as ‘whistleblowers’ and thereby play a key role in exposing and preventing such breaches and in safeguarding the welfare of society. However, potential whistleblowers are often discouraged from reporting their concerns or suspicions for fear of retaliation.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to all acts and policy areas where there is a need to strengthen enforcement, such as:

contracts involving the procurement of services.
It does not apply to:
contracting authorities in the area of the implementation of the EU budget;
the contracting authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in the field of public procurement.
EU countries may decide to extend the scope of the directive to other policy areas such as financial services and the financial services sector.
.
National authorities must ensure that whistleblowers are protected against:
by:
the protection of the confidentiality of their information
the prohibition of the disclosure of the identity of the person who made the disclosure
the restriction of the communication of confidential information to the authorities of other Member States
the limitation of the right of access to the information of a person who has made a disclosure to the competent authorities of another Member State.
Whistleblower protection
The EU countries must also ensure that the person concerned is protected against the following:
a ban on the publication of the names of the persons who made a public disclosure
a prohibition on the use of the information provided by the person to commit a breach of public law
a limitation on the right to disclose confidential information
a restriction on the person’s right to access the confidential information provided for in the act
the right to be informed of the nature of the breach and the reasons for its disclosure
an obligation to inform the competent authority of the country in which the breach took place.
WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?

Summary 40:
Minimum requirements for water reuse in the European Union (EU) — minimum requirements for the reuse of treated waste water
Minimum requirements to be met by EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EEC) 2020/741 on minimum requirements on water reuse
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the minimum requirements that EU countries must meet to ensure that treated wastewater is reused whenever it is appropriate and cost-efficient, thereby creating an enabling framework for those EU countries who wish to or need to practise water reuse.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out minimum water reuse requirements for EU countries.
The water resources of the EU are increasingly coming under pressure, leading to water scarcity and a deterioration in water quality. In particular, climate change, unpredictable weather patterns and drought are contributing significantly to the strain on the availability of freshwater, arising from urban development and agriculture. Water reuse is a promising option for many EU countries to reduce the impact of water scarcity.
EU countries must ensure that the water they reuse is treated in a way that minimises the impact on the water quality of surface water bodies and groundwater bodies and that it does not harm the environment or human health.
Water reuse is one of a number of measures that can help to reduce water scarcity in the EU, including the use of water-efficient technologies in industry and water-saving irrigation techniques.

Summary 45:
Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions — EU-wide rules for electronic payments
INTERFACE FEITS FOR CARD-BARRY TRANSACTIONS — EU countries must ensure that interchange fees are the same as those for cash-based transactions
INTERFERENCES
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that the interchange fees charged by payment service providers for the use of payment cards (i.e. cards issued by the European Union (EU) Member States) for the payment of goods and services in the EU are equivalent to those charged by merchants for the same payment within the Member State.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all electronic payment transactions in the Member States. It does not apply to cross-border payments.
It does not cover:
cross-border credit transfers and direct debits in euro in the internal market;
card-based payments in the euro area;
transactions in other currencies other than the euro, such as the US dollar, euro, British pound, Swiss franc or Swiss franc.
The European Commission has published a list of the fees to be charged by card service providers to merchants for each type of electronic payment. These include:
interchange fees, which are charged by the card service provider to the card issuer for the purpose of making a payment on the card’s behalf;
payment service providers’ interchange fees to the merchant for each use of a payment service provided by a card issuer;
cash-based interchange fees, charged by a merchant for the purposes of making an electronic payment on a card.
In addition, the EU countries may charge merchants for certain other fees, including:
.
These fees are calculated by the payment service provider on the basis of the total amount of the payment made by the merchant and the volume of the transaction. They are calculated according to the total number of transactions that the merchant has carried out in the previous 24 hours.
EU countries may also charge merchants directly or indirectly for the services they provide to consumers. These fees must be calculated on a case-by-case basis and must not exceed the cost borne by the trader for using a given means of payment.
Amending the regulation
The Commission has adopted a proposal to amend the regulation in order to:
introduce a ‘Honour All Cards’ rule, which allows card issuers to refuse to accept payment services from a merchant if they do not meet certain conditions;
ensure that the ‘honour all cards’ rules are applied to all card-issued debit and credit cards, irrespective of the country in which the card is issued.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 established the principle that charges paid by users for a cross-banking payment in euro are identical to those paid for the corresponding payment within a Member State, and the same for all other types of payment transactions covered by this regulation.
Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has provided a legal foundation for the creation of a Union-wide internal market for payments as it substantially facilitated the activity of payment service service providers, creating uniform rules with respect to the provision of payment services. However, integration of the Union payment card market is far from complete as many payment solutions cannot develop beyond their national borders and new pan-Union players are prevented from entering the market.
For more information, see:
‘E-payments’ on the European Commission's website.
BACKGROUND

KEY TERMS
* Interchange fee: a fee that is charged by an issuer of a card to a merchant to make a payment in the form of a credit or debit card.

Summary 49:
Third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the EU’s external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (codification) (Regulation (EU) 2018/1806) (SUMMARY OF:
Regulation on the free movement of persons between the EU countries and the Schengen area
Decision (EC) No 539/2001 on the exemption from the visa requirement for recognised refugees and stateless persons
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND OF THE DECISION?
The regulation sets out the criteria for determining whether a third country is subject to a visa for the crossing of EU countries’ external borders (also referred to herein as ‘the visa requirement’) or whether a non-EU country is exempt from such a requirement.
The decision is based on a case-by-case assessment of the third country in which those persons reside and which issued their travel documents.
KEY POINTS
Annex I to the regulation lists the third countries that require a visa when crossing EU borders for stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period, with the possibility of having country-specific amendments to those annexes in particular circumstances, for instance as a result of a visa liberalisation process or as the ultimate consequence of a temporary suspension of the visa exemption.
In Annex II, the list of third countries for which a visa is required is divided into two categories:
non-EU countries that have a visa requirement when crossing their external borders for a stay of at least 90 days, with a maximum stay of 180 days, and those countries that do not have such a visa.
A third country may be exempt from the requirement if it meets certain criteria, such as:
recognised refugees;
stateless persons;

Summary 53:
Protecting against injurious pricing of vessels
Protecting from the damage caused by selling ships below their normal value
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 on protection against the sale of ships below the normal value of vessels (codification)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96 on the protection against shipbuilding injurious pricing.
It aims to ensure that EU countries can take action against any shipbuilder selling a vessel below its normal value which causes injury to the EU industry.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down rules on the calculation of the ‘normal value’ of a ship.
The normal value is calculated using a representative sale of a like vessel in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country. It must be based on a comparable sale of similar vessels in the importing country. The normal value must include the amounts for selling, general and administrative costs and the profit margin that should be included in such value.
EU countries must notify the European Commission of any shipbuilders from contracting parties to the Shipbuilding Agreement who have sold a ship below normal value to a non-EU country and inform the Commission of the reason for this. The Commission may then launch an investigation into the sale.
If the sale is considered to be made at a loss and may be disregarded, the buyer of the vessel may have recourse to sale of the like vessel to a third country or to an EU buyer, or to the owner of the ship. If the buyer is an EU country, the sale may be subject to a countervailing or anti-dumping duty.
Annex III of the regulation sets out the procedure for the Commission to take all necessary steps to ascertain, in the large conglomerates and holdings of the contracting parties, the validity of accounting and financial statements.
In the event of a sale at less than normal value, the Commission may take all the necessary measures to determine whether the vessel was sold at a lower price than it should have been. If so, it must inform the shipowner of the reasons for the sale and inform him or her of the decision to terminate the sale or to sell the vessel.
Where a ship is sold at below its usual price, the EU country may impose an anti-subsidy or antidumping duty on the vessel if it is found to have been sold below the usual price.
Importers of ships may be liable for a duty of up to 10 % of the normal price of a comparable vessel sold to the importing or exporting country if they have sold the vessel at a price that is below the average price of the comparable vessel. The EU country which sold the ship may also impose a duty on a vessel which is sold below its average price. The duty may also apply to a vessel that has been repaired or rebuilt in another EU country.
A shipowner may also be held liable for any damage caused to the industry caused by the vessel’s normal value if:
the vessel was built in a country which is not a contracting party to the agreement;
the normal value was sold to an importer of a vessel built in another country; or
the ship was built by a shipowner in a non–EU country which was built under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The EU may also take other measures to protect the industry if it considers that the vessel is being sold at an unfair price. These measures may include:
suspension of the right to build the vessel;
imposition of duties on the ship;
restrictions on the right of the buyer to repair the vessel or to use the vessel for the purpose of repairing it;
temporary suspension of the rights of the seller or the buyer.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
The legislation has applied since 30 June 2016. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 30 June 2017.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the legislation.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/444 — establishing the Customs programme
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets up the Customs 2020 programme to support EU countries’ customs authorities in their efforts to enhance cooperation in order to facilitate legitimate and fair cross-border trade.
It aims to support the EU’s external aspects of the internal market, the common commercial policy and the other common EU policies having a bearing on trade, and to overall supply chain security.
KEY POINTS
   
The programme aims to:
facilitate and enhance customs cooperation between EU countries and the customs authorities;

protect the legitimate and economic interests of the EU and its citizens against terrorist, health, environmental and other threats;
provide support for the wider mission of customs authorities, as provided for in Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The EU countries are responsible for setting up the programme and the European Commission is responsible for implementing it. The programme is funded by the EU budget and is implemented by the Commission.
The European Commission, assisted by the European Parliament and the Council, manages the programme. The EU countries have the right to opt out of the programme if they do not wish to do so. However, they may decide to participate in the following ways:
contribute to the programme by:
:
providing the EU countries with technical assistance;
contributing to the establishment of a customs information exchange system;
supporting the development of customs information systems and the exchange of best practice;
encouraging the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve the efficiency of customs procedures;
developing a customs data exchange system for the prevention and detection of fraud;
promoting cooperation between customs authorities and businesses in the fight against counterfeiting, counterfeiting and smuggling of goods;
facilitating cooperation between the EU country concerned and the national customs authorities of the other EU countries.
Implementing the programme
EU countries must ensure that:
customs authorities cooperate with each other in the areas covered by the programme, such as:
information exchange and exchange of information;
the exchange of data;
coordination of information on customs procedures, procedures and systems;
training of customs staff;
cooperation in the fields of information technology (IT) and digitalisation;
sharing of best practices;
exchange of experience and best practice in the area of customs cooperation.

implementation of the common EU customs policy.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 15 March 2021. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 15 April 2021.
BACKGROUND
 
  The customs union has been one of the cornerstones of the Union for over 50 years and is essential for the proper functioning of its internal market for the benefit of both businesses and citizens. It is therefore appropriate, efficient and in the interest of the union to continue financing activities in this field by establishing a new programme.

Summary 63:
A mandatory transparency register for interest representatives in EU policy-making and policy implementation — EU countries’ permanent representations
An agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on a voluntary transparency register.
A voluntary transparency registry for EU countries' permanent representations.
SUMMARY OF:
Interinstitutional agreement on a compulsory transparency register
Decision (EU) 2020/852 — conclusion of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the EU countries and the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies on the implementation of the EU’s transparency register (the ‘Transparency Register’)
Interstitutional agreement of 20 May 2021 on a joint framework for their cooperation on a transparency register on a mandatory transparency list
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to ensure that interest representatives (representatives of organisations and self-employed individuals who have an interest in EU policies, programmes or activities) are registered in the EU's transparency register and that the information they provide on their activities is made available to the public.
The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of EU countries.
KEY POINTS
   
The European Parliament (European Parliament) and the Council (European Union (European Council) are committed to maintaining an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society in accordance with Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), and in particular Article 11(1) and (2) of the TEU. This dialogue enables stakeholders to present their views on decisions that may affect them and hence to contribute effectively to the evidence base on which policy proposals are made.
Activities of public authorities, as well as of any association or network of such public authorities that acts on their behalf at EU, national or subnational level, should not be covered by this agreement, although associations and networks of public bodies that engage in interest representation activities should be allowed to register. However, the signatory institutions recognise the importance of coordinating their approach through the adoption of a joint transparency register in order to further promote interest representation that is transparent and ethical.
This agreement sets out the rules and principles to be observed by interest representatives that sign up to the register. It also establishes a code of conduct to be followed by all interest representatives.
In order to encourage interest representatives to register on the transparency register, each EU country must publish on its website a list of all the information it receives from interest representatives on its territory. It must also publish on the website of the register conditionality and complementary transparency measures that they put in place to encourage registration, such as dedicated mailing lists, the recommendation that certain decision-makers meet only registered interest representatives, or the publication of information on meetings between certain EU officials.
Each EU country is responsible for ensuring that the register is up-to-date and that information on the activities of interest representatives is made publicly available. In addition, it must publish a report on the register every 3 years on the progress made by the register and on the actions taken by the signatories to implement the agreement.
FROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS ENTER INTO FORCE?
They entered into force on 1 July 2020.
BACKGROUND
 
  The EU has adopted a number of transparency agreements with non-EU countries over the past few years, including the 2014 agreement on interest representation (see summary).

KEY POINTS
The regulation sets up the EU Recovery Instrument (ERI) for the period 2020-2023.
The ERI is a multiannual financial instrument designed to support EU countries in their efforts to recover from the effects of COVID. It aims to:
recover the economic and social damage caused by the crisis;
reinforce cohesion among EU countries;
support the efforts of EU countries to restore labour markets and social protection;
provide support for social inclusion and repair the immediate damage to businesses;
facilitate the transition towards a green and digital economy;
encourage investment in sustainable growth and jobs.

It aims to improve the effectiveness of the EU’s budgetary surveillance system by strengthening the role of the European Commission and the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
It sets out the rules for the enforcement of EU countries’ budgetary surveillance.
KEY POINTS
EU countries whose currency is the euro have a particular interest in and a responsibility to conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union and to avoid policies that jeopardise that functioning.
To achieve this, the EU has adopted a number of measures to strengthen economic governance. These include:
the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which aims to prevent and correct excessive government deficits;
the European Semester for strengthened coordination of economic and budgetary policies;
an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive government deficit;
minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks;
enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, including macroprudential supervision by the European Systemic Risk Board.
The European Commission plays a stronger role in the enhanced surveillance procedure as regards assessments that are specific to each EU country, monitoring, on-site missions, recommendations and warnings.
An economic dialogue between the Commission and EU countries may be established, enabling the Commission to make its analyses public and the President of the Council, the European Council and, where appropriate, the president of the Eurogroup to discuss.
. The Commission may also invite the European Economic and Social Committee (EEC) to participate in an economic dialogue.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 23 November 2011. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 23 November 2012.
BACKGROUND
 
  The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the SGP and the other measures of the ESM. The ESM is the cornerstone of the new EU economic governance framework.

Fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in EU waters and, for EU fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters
Fishing options for certain species and groups thereof, applying in EU and non-EU waters
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/123 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for fish stocks* and groups* in the EU and in certain other waters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the total allowable catch (TAC) for each species and group of fish in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
The TAC is calculated on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the advisory councils.
EU countries must ensure that:
the TACs are set at the maximum yield (MS) of the fish stock or group for which they have an obligation to land all catches, including by-catches from those stocks, in mixed fisheries;
fishing opportunities are fixed in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each EU country for each fish stock and fishery;
the fishing opportunities are based on the advice figure for total catches, not on the wanted catches (i.e. the amount of fish to be caught by a fishing vessel).
The EU countries must:
ensure that the TAC for all species is set at a maximum yield of at least 13 % of the MS;
set the maximum allowable catch for all groups of species at at least 16 % of MS.
Fisheries must avoid discarding fish in order to avoid the phenomenon of ‘choke species’, which occurs when a fish is caught but dies before it can be eaten.
The fishing opportunities must be set in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) set out in Article 2(2) of that regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 1 January 2020.
BACKGROUND
   
The CFP is the EU’s fisheries policy. It aims to protect the marine environment and the economic interests of the fishing industry.
For more information, see:
‘Fishing Opportunities’ on the European Commission's website.
KEY TERMS
* Choke species: fish that die before they are eaten by other fish.
* Mixed fishery: a fishery in which fish are caught by more than one fishing vessel in the same area.
ACT
Council Regulation (EEC) 2018/852 of 26 November 2018 fixing for 2019 the fishing quotas for certain molluscs and crustaceans in the waters of the European Economic Area (EEA) (see summary) and for certain other fish stocks in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (See summary).

SUMMARY OF:
INTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EU PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUREAN COMMISSION on BETTER LAW-MAKING
Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making between the EU institutions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND THE INTERINSTITUTIONS?
The decision marks the conclusion of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IBA) between the three EU institutions — the EU Parliament, Council and European Commission — which aims to improve the quality of EU legislation and reduce the regulatory burden for citizens, administrations and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The aim of the IBA is to ensure that EU legislation is as simple and as clear as possible, avoids overregulation and administrative burdens for citizens and administrations, especially SMEs, and is designed with a view to facilitating its transposition and practical application and to strengthening the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU economy.
KEY POINTS
The IBA aims to:
ensure that legislation is based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (i.e. that the legislation is designed to provide the greatest added value for European citizens and businesses);
promote transparency in the legislative process;
encourage the participation of the public in the decision-making process and in the drafting of the legislation;
facilitate the transposition of legislation in the EU;
provide the public with the opportunity to have their views and opinions heard;
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legislative procedure by ensuring that delegated acts are drawn up in a way that is transparent and accessible to the public.
The three institutions agree to pursue the goals of simplifying EU legislation without prejudice to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union, as specified in the Treaties, or to safeguarding the integrity of the internal market. In this context, they recall the equality of both co-legislators as enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.
In addition, the three institutions recognise their joint responsibility in delivering high-quality Union legislation and in ensuring that such legislation focuses on areas where it is as efficient and effective as possible in delivering the common policy objectives. They also agree to promote the transparency of the legal process and to encourage the involvement of citizens in drafting EU legislation.

Administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (IMI)
Installing and operating IMI
Implementing the EU’s internal market information system (Imi)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through IMI (‘the IMI Regulation’)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND OF THE DECISION?
The regulation establishes a legal framework for the use of IMI, a centralised communication system designed to facilitate cross-border administrative cooperation between EU countries and the European Commission.
The decision repeals Commission Decision 2008/49/EC.
KEY POINTS
Imi is a software application accessible via the internet, developed by the Commission in cooperation with the EU countries in order to assist EU countries with the practical implementation of information exchange requirements laid down in EU acts by providing an effective, user-friendly tool for the implementation of administrative cooperation. It allows EU countries to identify their counterpart in another EU country, to manage the exchange of information, including personal data, on the basis of simple and unified procedures and to overcome language barriers.
IMI is designed to improve the functioning of the internal market by providing a centralisation of information and mutual assistance. It does this by:
providing an effective means of administrative coordination between the competent authorities of EU countries;
ensuring that information exchanged via IMI is collected, processed and used for purposes in line with those for which it was originally collected and for which are subject to all relevant safeguards.
It does not only for the purposes for which would otherwise take place via other means, including regular mail, fax or electronic mail.
Implementation of EU acts requires EU countries’ authorities and bodies to exchange information with one another and with the Commission. It also requires that EU countries:
ensure that personal data are only processed for the purpose for which they were originally collected;
provide each other with the necessary information to carry out the processing of personal data;
notify the other EU countries of any changes to personal data that may be necessary for the application of an EU act.
EU countries must ensure that the information exchanged by IMI complies with all relevant EU data protection rules and that it is protected by all relevant privacy and data security safeguards. They must also ensure that IMI users have access to the following information:
the information they provide to the IMI user;
the data they send to the user, including their name, address and telephone number;
information they receive from the user on the use and processing of their personal data.
In addition, EU countries must provide each other and the Commission with any existing additional translation functionality that meets their needs, is compatible with the security and confidentiality requirements for the exchange in IMI and can be offered at a reasonable cost.
Annexes to the regulation set out the rules for the operation of the system.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
 
   
It has applied since 14 November 2012. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 14 November 2013.
BACKGROUND
  EU countries have to cooperate more effectively and exchange information more effectively to implement certain EU acts governing the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital in the EU.

Unitary patent protection in the European Union (EU) — enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection (EU 2017/852)
Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision of the European Patent Office (EPO) in order to ensure uniform patent protection across the EU.
Unitary European patent protection is the legal basis for the granting of European patents in the EU, which are granted to companies that manufacture or distribute products across national borders.
The European Patent Organisation (EPC) is responsible for granting European patents. The European Patent Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) was signed between the EPC and the participating EU countries in 2011. The EPCA was amended in 2017 by the EU’s new patent directive. It aims to ensure that European patents granted by the EPO have the same protection throughout the EU as those granted by national patent offices.
ACT
Regulation (EU] No 1257/2012 of the EU Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2012 implementing enhanced cooperation between Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, France, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (hereinafter ‘participating Member States’).
SUMMARY
The EPO has the power to grant European patents with a unitary effect (i.e. a patent that has the same effect in all EU countries). The EPO grants European patents by means of a special agreement between the participating countries and the European Commission.
A European patent granted by an EU country may benefit from unitary protection by virtue of this regulation in the participating Member States. The proprietor of the patent may transfer the patent to a non-EU country or, if the proprietor is a resident of the participating country, to another EU country or to another European country.
EU countries must ensure that the patent is granted to a company that has a manufacturing or distribution activity in one of their territories and that it is licensed in the territory of the other participating countries.
Each participating country must designate an EPO representative to oversee the implementation of the EPCA and the coordination of the procedures for granting and revoking the patent.

investment projects which have not been financed by him or by his own money;
other financial institutions established by him and which are not involved in the recovery of his or her own money.
the creditor may not use the funds of a third party.
A creditor may apply for an EOP if he or she has been declared insolvent by the Court of Justice of the Member State in which the account is located.
An EOP is valid for up to 30 days from the date of entry into force of the EOP. The EOP may be renewed for a further 30 days if the debtor has not complied with the conditions laid down in the EAP.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APO APPLY?
The regulation entered into force on 1 July 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2015.

It also includes steps such as intercepting vessels suspected of trying to gain entry to the EU without submitting to border checks, as well as arrangements intended to address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during a border surveillance operation at sea and arrangements to bring such an operation to a successful conclusion.
Risk analysis and training are provided by the EASA and by the EU countries and the European Maritime and Coast Guard Agency (EMCA).
The European Commission has the power to adopt delegated acts to implement the regulation. These delegated acts are adopted by the Council of the EU and the EU Member States.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes transitional arrangements to ensure that EU countries are able to conclude or conclude bilateral investments agreements with non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries before the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on 1 January 2013.
It sets out the conditions under which EU countries may amend or conclude such agreements.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to agreements signed between 1 December 2009 and 9 January 2013 between the Member States of the EU and the countries of the EEA. It does not apply to agreements concluded before 1 December 2011.
Bilateral investment agreements are binding on the EU countries under public international law and will be progressively replaced by agreements of the Union relating to the same subject matter.
The EU has exclusive competence with respect to the common commercial policy. It may legislate and adopt legally binding acts within that area only if so empowered by the EU Member States.
EU countries are required to take the necessary measures to eliminate incompatibilities, where they exist, with EU law, contained in bilateral agreements concluded between them and other countries. They must also inform the European Commission of any incompatibility between their own law and those of the other Member States, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the TFEU (see summary).
.
In addition, EU countries must ensure that their investment agreements comply with the common rules on capital movements laid down in Chapter 4 of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaties on the movement of capital between the EU, including in respect of capital movements involving investments.
Investment agreements must be amended or concluded with the consent of the competent authority of the Member State in which the investment is to be made. The agreement must contain the following information:
the terms and conditions of the investment agreement;
the nature and scope of the investments;
a description of the activities to be carried out by the company;
an indication of the type of investment agreement and the conditions for its conclusion.
If the agreement does not contain the necessary information, the Commission may decide to suspend or terminate the agreement if it considers that it does not meet the conditions set out in the agreement or that the agreement is incompatible with the EU’s investment policy.
Where the Commission considers that an investment agreement with an EEA country does not comply with its investment policy, it may issue an authorisation to open negotiations or conclude the agreement with the country concerned. The Commission must inform the other EU countries of its decision to do so and inform them of the reasons for the suspension or termination of the agreement.
An EU country may suspend or cancel the agreement on its own initiative if:
it does not fulfil the conditions laid down by the agreement; or
it fails to fulfil its obligations under the agreement, or if the agreement has been terminated by the other party.
Implementation of the regulation is subject to the approval of the Commission and the European Parliament and the Council of the Council.

They must also, in order to raise the appeal of EMAS for organisations, take account of EMMSs in their procurement policies and, where appropriate, refer to EMAS or equivalent environmental management system as contract performance conditions for works and service.
National authorities must encourage organisations to register with EMAS and to provide the Commission with information on their EMAS activities. The Commission may also use EMAS as a tool in the enforcement of EU environmental legislation.
Registers
The Commission must publish a register of all organisations that have been registered under EMAS, as well as a list of those that have not been registered. The register must be updated every 5 years. It must contain information on:
organisations’ environmental performance;
the number of sites covered by EMAS;
how EMAS has been implemented;
environmental impact assessments carried out;
information on the environmental impact assessment carried out by the Commission and by the Member States.

Scope
The regulation applies to airports serving civil aviation located in the territory of an EU country, to operators providing services at such airports and to entities providing goods and/or services to or through such airports. It does not cover security measures that apply on board an aircraft, or during a flight, of EU air carriers.
EU countries may decide whether to deploy in-flight security officers on aircraft registered in that EU country and on flights of air carriers licensed by it and to ensure, in accordance with paragraph 4.7 of Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and under the terms of that Convention, that such officers are government personnel who are specially selected and trained, taking into account the required security and safety aspects on board the aircraft.
Each EU country must designate a single aviation security authority responsible for the implementation of the security measures laid down in the regulation. This authority is responsible for ensuring that:
airport security measures are in place at the airport where the airport is located;
airports in the airport are secure;
security measures are implemented by the airport authority of the EU country in which the air carrier is registered;
the airport authority in question has the authority to monitor the security of the airport;
there is a risk assessment of the level of threat to civil aviation.
The European Commission may, on the basis of this risk assessment, examine whether to grant derogations from the basic security standards laid down by the EU countries. If the Commission considers that a derogation is not justified, it must inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons for its decision.
If the Commission concludes that the derogations are justified, the derogation may be granted by the Commission.

Textile labels and markings of certain textile products which contain non-animal origin — textiles fibres — textile fibres
SUMMARY OF:
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules for the labelling or marking of certain products which are not made exclusively of textile materials but have a textile content which constitutes an essential part of the product or to which attention is specifically drawn by the economic operator.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down harmonised rules with regard to certain aspects of textile labelling, in particular textile fibre names. It sets out the requirement for manufacturers to indicate the presence of non animal fibres on the labels, markings and documents which accompany textile products at the various stages of their production, processing and distribution.
Labelling must indicate:
the fibre name of the fibre;
the quantity of the fibres in the product; and
the quality of the finished product.
The labelling must be clearly visible on the label or on the product’s accompanying documents. It must also indicate the fibre composition of the textile.
Manufacturers must indicate the fibre name and the fibre composition in the form of a numerical value in the format indicated in the Annexes to the regulation. This must be done in a language easily understood by the end consumer.

Labels and markings must indicate that the product has been manufactured in a way that is clearly visible to the consumer and that is not misleading. The labelling should be accompanied by the textured fibre name ‘Fibre Name’ or ‘Textile Fibre Fibre Composition’. The textured fibres must be labelled ‘Ternary Fibre’, ‘Binary Fibre Mixture’ and ‘Mixtures’ in accordance with Directive 96/73/EC on the quantitative analysis of ternary fibre mixtures (see summary).
The texturing of the label and the accompanying document must indicate, in a clear and legible way, the fibre content of each fibre and the quantity of each fibre in each textile. The label and accompanying document should also indicate that:
a fibre name is used to indicate that a fibre has been made from a fibre of a non-human animal origin;
a fibre name indicates that the fibre is made from fibres of an animal origin other than that of the animal;
an indication of the quality of a fibre is indicated on the texturing document indicating that a fibre is made of a fibrous material other than the animal origin.
EU countries may not prohibit the use of a new textile fibre name if it is compatible with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and is not incompatible with the Treaties. However, they must ensure that it is not used for the purpose of misleading the consumer or that it does not refer to a fibre which is not of the same fibre composition as the one specified in the regulation or which is of a different fibre composition.

Summary 141:
Cross-border insolvency proceedings — rules for the coordination of insolvencies in EU countries (Regulation (EU) 2015/848) (REcast)
Transnational insolvent companies have more and more cross-border activities and are therefore increasingly being regulated by EU law. This Regulation aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of insolvent proceedings across the EU. It lays down rules on jurisdiction, recognition and applicable law in this area.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down the rules on the coordination between EU countries when an insolvent company or other legal person seeks to liquidate its assets in another EU country.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
bankruptcy proceedings which meet the conditions set out in it, irrespective of whether the debtor is a natural person or a legal person, a trader or an individual.
Direct winding-up proceedings, which are directly derived from insolvent cases, and analogous proceedings and actions related to such proceedings are excluded from the regulation. However, the mere fact that a national procedure is not listed in Annex A to this regulation does not imply that it is covered by Regulation (EU] No 1215/2012.
National procedures for winding-ups are laid down in the annex to the regulation, which is binding and directly applicable in all EU countries. These procedures must be carried out by the competent national courts of the EU country in which the insolvent debtor is resident.
The insolvent creditor must have the right to appoint a lawyer to represent him or her in the proceedings. The lawyer must be appointed by the court of the debtor in the country where the proceedings are taking place. The debtor may also appoint a representative of the general body of creditors to represent the creditor in the course of the proceedings, provided that the representative is not a member of the creditor’s general body. The representative must be independent from the debtor and must not have a financial interest in the case.
Annexes A and B of the regulation set out the national procedures to be followed by insolvent creditors in the event that the debtor wishes to transfer assets or judicial proceedings from one EU country to another, seeking to obtain a more favourable legal position.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 5 June 2015. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 5 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
 
  The European Commission adopted a report on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 in the context of the restructuring of companies. The report concluded that the regulation is functioning well in general but that it would be desirable to improve its application in order to enhance the effective administration of cross–border insolvent procedures.

European rail network for competitive freight
European rail system for freight transport
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 — establishing international rail corridors for a competitive freight network
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a framework for the establishment of international rail freight corridors for the purpose of providing rail freight services across the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation sets out the rules for the setting up of international freight corridors (i.e. rail freight networks) which meet specific needs in one or more clearly identified segments of the freight market.
The objectives of the regulation are to:
ensure that freight trains can run under good conditions and easily pass from one national network to another;
provide a good quality and sufficiently financed railway infrastructure that allows freight transport services to be provided under good terms in terms of commercial speed and journey times and to be reliable, namely, that the service it provides actually corresponds to the contractual agreements entered into with the railway undertakings.
It also aims to improve the conditions of use of existing railway infrastructure by enabling the required interconnections between existing rail infrastructure.
Design of freight corridors
The design of the corridors should take into account, where appropriate, the need for better interconnection with the rail infrastructure of European non-EU countries and with those of European third countries. Projects aimed at establishing such freight corridors should be supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF. The EIB is responsible for the development of rail infrastructure in the EU.
.
Funding
The EIB and the EIB are funded by the EU’s Cohesion Fund, which is the main source of EU funding for the creation of the European rail network. It is managed by the Commission and is managed under the responsibility of the Commission. The Commission may also provide financial support from the European Economic and Social Fund (EESF) and from other sources, such as the European Research and Innovation Facility (ERIF) or the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMF).
The European Commission may grant EIB or EEF financial support for projects which meet the following criteria:
the establishment of an international freight corridor;
the development of an intermodal link between the existing TEN-T and/or the ERTMS rail networks; and
the creation of a European railway traffic management system (ERTMS) for the transport of freight.

‘Health and safety indicators’ on Eurostat's website.
* KEY TERMS
* Occupational health indicators: indicators that measure the health status of people working or living in the same place at the same time, such as occupational accidents, occupational illnesses and occupational accidents at work. They are used to assess the impact and effectiveness of the measures taken under the new Community strategy on occupational safety and health, as well as to take into account the increase in the proportion of women on the labour market and to respond to their specific needs in relation to policies on health protection at work, and in particular to the need to develop a European statistical system in the area of occupational safety. These indicators are used by the Commission to identify possible indicators for joint objectives for developing care systems and to provide information on the progress made in the context of the Community action programme in the field of public health (2003-2008).
* European Community health indicator: an indicator that measures the health of people living or working in a particular place at a particular time in order to assess their health status and their health and well-being. It is based on a set of measures that are designed to measure the impact of the actions taken by the Member States to improve the quality of life of people in that place and to assess how the measures are being implemented.

Access to the natural gas market — conditions for access to the gas transmission networks
Access to access the natural energy market — requirements for third parties
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 on conditions for accessing the gas market
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the conditions for third party access to natural gas networks in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all natural gas transmission and distribution systems in the EU. It does not apply to high-pressure pipelines linking up local distributors to the network which are not primarily used in the context of local distribution.
Tarriffs for access are set out in the regulation’s Annex I.
The tariff for access is calculated according to the actual costs of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator (i.e. a natural gas distribution system operator) and the actual cost of operating the network. The tariff is calculated using the benchmarking of tariffs by the regulatory authorities of the EU countries.
It does not affect the tariffs for access provided for in Directive 2009/73/EC on the internal market in natural gas (see summary).
The tariffs are calculated on the basis of:
the actual costs incurred by the network operator;
the return on investments made by the operator and the return on investment (ROI);
the level of investment by the third party in the network; and
the amount of gas supplied to the consumer.
Access conditions
the tariff is based on the same criteria as those set out of the national market for natural gas.
Third party access services
The third party must provide the consumer with:
a guarantee of equal market access for all gas consumers in the country in which it is located;
access to the market for the purposes of the sale of natural gas in the territory of the country where it is supplied;
information on the prices charged for the services provided;
a description of the costs of the services offered;
an indication of how the tariff is to be calculated.
A third party may not provide the same services as the national network operator if:
it does not have a dominant position in the market;
it is not a member of the regulated gas market; or
it has not been involved in the operation of the network for more than 5 years.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 14 August 2009. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 14 August 2011.
BACKGROUND
 
  * KEY TERMS

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 662/2009 establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion agreements between Member States and third countries on particular matters concerning the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a procedure to authorise a Member State to amend an existing agreement or to negotiate and conclude a new agreement with a non-European Union (EU) country.
It does not affect the exclusive competence of the EU and the provisions of Articles 300 and 307 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the procedure for authorising an EU country to amend or conclude an agreement with another EU country on specific civil justice issues falling within the scope of Article 300 of the TFEU. It does not apply if the EU has already concluded an agreement on the same subject matter.
An EU country must notify the European Commission of its intention to conclude a bilateral agreement with the country concerned by way of an already existing mandate of negotiation or an envisaged mandate.
The Commission must then notify the EU country of its intentions to conclude the agreement by means of an electronic notification. The agreement must contain all the information necessary for the conclusion of the agreement, including:
the terms and conditions for its conclusion;
the reasons for the agreement’s entry into force;
a description of the parties’ rights and obligations under the agreement;
details of the procedures for concluding the agreement.
If the Commission considers that the agreement is not compatible with the EU acquis, it may decide to terminate the agreement without prejudice to its exclusive competence. If the agreement does not contain the necessary information, the agreement may be terminated.
In the event that the Commission decides to terminate an agreement, it must inform the other parties of the reasons for its decision and inform them of the reason for its termination. It may also decide to suspend the agreement until the other party has provided the necessary documentation to conclude it.
Where the Commission concludes that an agreement is incompatible with the acquis or with the principles of EU law, it has the right to withdraw from the agreement and to enter into negotiations on a new one. The Commission may also withdraw from negotiations if it considers the agreement to be incompatible with EU law.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 on specific provisions to be made available to the EU’s cohesion policy
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out specific rules for the funding of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation under the European regional development funds (ERCDFs).
It aims to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reduce the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, crossborder and mountain regions.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The ERDF supports projects that aim to tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions, such as: poor accessibility, especially in relation to information and communication technologies (ICT) connectivity and transport infrastructure, declining local industries, an inappropriate business environment, lack of networks among local and regional administrations, low levels of research and innovation and take-up of ICT, environmental pollution, risk prevention and negative attitudes towards neighbouring country citizens.
The funding is provided by the European Commission, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
. The ERDF is one of the four main pillars of the EU cohesion policy: the European cohesion policy, the Cohesion Fund, the Structural and Investment Funds (SIFs), the Regional Cooperation Fund (RDF), the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFFD) and EAFRD.
Programmes
The European Regional Development Funds (ERFDs) are funded by the EU countries’ cohesion policy priorities. They aim to support the harmonious development of their territories at different levels. They are divided into 4 priority areas:
transnational cooperation
cross-border cooperation
research and innovation
interregional research and development.
Cross-border research
Interregional collaboration
Research and innovation (R&I)
Research-intensive R&I programmes
The Regional Research and Innovation Framework (RIFs)
The RIFs are designed to support R&Is in the areas of research, innovation and entrepreneurship in the regions of the participating EU countries. They support the development of research facilities and research clusters, as well as the creation of research centres and R&D centres in the participating countries.
Cooperation in the fields of education and health
The EIFs aim to promote the integration of the labour market in border regions by encouraging the exchange of knowledge and experience between EU countries and other countries in order to improve the quality of education, health and social services in border areas.
Transnational cooperation is designed to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion priority priorities, and also to exploit the untapped growth potential of border areas (development of R & I facilities and clusters), while enhancing the cooperation process for the purpose of the overall harmonious growth of the Union.
Regional cooperation
The regional cooperation programmes under the EIFS are organised by the Regional Coordination Centre (RCC). The RCC is responsible for coordinating the activities of the RDFs under the RIFFs and for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the programmes. It is assisted by the RCC and the Commission.

Agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway on the surrender procedure for suspects and convicts (REACHING THE AGREEMENTS) — Declarations
Agreement concerning the surrender of suspects and convicted persons by the Member States of the European Union (EU) and Iceland (Iceland) and Norway (Norway)
SUMMARY OF:
Decision 2006/1021/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European EU and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on a surrender procedure between the Member countries of the EU, Iceland, Norway and Norway
Decisions 2006/12/EC and 2006/13/EC concluding the Agreement on the European Arrest Warrant for the purpose of prosecution or execution of sentence between Iceland and Iceland, and Norway, and on the Commission’s proposal for an EU-Iceland extradition agreement between the two countries
Agreements between the parties to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISIONS AND OF THE REGULATION?
The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the Council of Europe (now the EU).
The agreement aims to speed up the procedure for the extradition of suspected or convicted persons from the EU countries to the EU country where they have been arrested.
KEY POINTS
The EU countries are parties to a number of international conventions in the field of extradition, including the EU Convention on extradition of 13 December 1957 and the European Convention on the suppression of terrorism of 27 January 1977. The EU countries have uniform extradition laws with a common concept of extradition.
An EU country may refuse to extradite a suspect or convicted person to another EU country if there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in that country.
The surrender procedure is based on a warrant issued by the country where the requested person has been arrested and the decision on his or her surrender must be made by the judicial authority of the country of arrest.
A judicial authority in the country which issued the warrant must take the decision to surrender the requested suspect or convict to the competent authorities of the other EU country. The decision must be based on the following principles:
the person has the right to a fair trial;
the warrant has been issued by a country of nationality or ethnic origin,
the requested person is a national of an EU country and has been convicted of a criminal offence;
there is no risk of the person being subjected to torture or to other cruel or inhuman treatment and punishment in the other country;
no person who has been surrendered to a country where there is serious risk of death or is subject to torture is liable to be extradited to that country for the purposes of the execution of the warrant.
In the event of refusal to surrender, the person concerned must be informed of the reasons for the refusal and of the conditions under which the refusal may be made. The requested person may also refuse to surrender to the country for which the warrant was issued.
If the request for surrender is made by a person of a nationality other than that of the requested country, the country in which the request is made must inform the requesting country of the reason for refusal. The requesting country must also inform the other parties of the grounds for refusal and the reasons on which it may decide to refuse the surrender.
Where the requested persons has not been informed of reasons for refusal, the request may be refused on the grounds that:
he or she is a threat to public order or public security;
it is contrary to the principles of fundamental rights; or
there are grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime punishable by death or by imprisonment;
he/she is a danger to public security or public order, public security, public health or public safety, public order and public health, or is a risk to the public or private security, or to public health and public order.
Each EU country has the power to decide whether to grant or refuse to grant the surrender if it considers that the refusal is in the interest of the public interest, public policy, public safety or the protection of the general public or the public, or if the refusal would be contrary to public policy or the interests of the common interest of public security.
Under the agreement, the parties agree to improve, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the cooperation in the area of extradition between, on the one hand, the countries which have signed the EU convention on extradition, and the countries that have not signed the convention, by taking account of, as minimum standards, the terms of the Convention of 27 September 1996 relating to extradition between EU countries. The agreement does not prevent a country from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, the freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media and freedom fighters. It also does not preclude the exercise of the right of a judicial authority to apply its national law in the context of the implementation of this agreement.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 on the EU Ecolabels
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the criteria for the award of the EU eco-labels (ecolabels) to products that have a reduced environmental impact during their entire life cycle.
It aims to provide consumers with accurate, non-deceptive, science-based information on the environmental impact of products.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all products in the EU, including food and feed products, as well as unprocessed agricultural products that lie within the scope of the organic production and labelling of organic products. It does not apply to non-food products, such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, medical devices and cosmetics.
The criteria for awarding the ecolabs are based on the best environmental performance achieved by products on the European Union market. They must be based on scientific evidence, taking into account the latest technological developments.
Eligible products
Products must meet the following criteria:
have a minimum environmental performance of at least 0.5% by weight of the product during its whole life cycle;
have at least 1% by volume of the material used in the production, processing, packaging or transport of the products;
not use of hazardous substances (e.g. mercury, lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury, hexavalent chromium, hexafluorocarbons, hexamethyllead and hexamethylfluoridea, hexacarbons and hexavalentalfluoride;
be manufactured in a way that minimises the impact of these substances on the environment, health and the environment.
Products that fulfil all of these criteria are eligible for the Ecolabs. However, the European Commission may decide to exclude certain products from the list of eligible products if they do not meet the criteria. The Commission must inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons for this decision within 3 months of receiving a proposal for an application for an ecolabel. If the Commission considers that a product does not meet all the criteria, it may withdraw from the scheme.
In addition, the Commission may grant an award to a product that does not comply with the criteria set out in the regulation if it considers that the product has a significant environmental impact and that its environmental performance does not correspond to the criteria laid down in the legislation.
Awards are awarded to products which fulfil the criteria listed in Annex I of the regulation. The award is valid for a period of 5 years from the date on which the product is placed on the market. The period of validity of the award is determined by the Commission’s decision to grant the award.
Annex II sets out a procedure for the revision of the criteria and for the withdrawal of an award for products that do not conform with the new criteria. It is up to the Commission to decide whether to withdraw the award for a product which does not conform.
