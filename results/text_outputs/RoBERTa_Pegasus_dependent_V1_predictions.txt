EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 575/2014 establishing the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for the period 2014-2020 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets up the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for the period 2014-2020. KEY POINTS The EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) is the main funding instrument for asylum and migration at EU level. It supports EU countries’ efforts to develop, monitor and evaluate their asylum policies in the light of their obligations under EU law. It also supports EU countries’ efforts to implement safe and dignified returns of irregular migrants.

European fingerprint database European fingerprint database SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 on the European fingerprint database (Eurodac) WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It lays down rules for the transmission of fingerprint data to the European Union’s (EU’s) European fingerprint database (Eurodac). KEY POINTS The purpose of Eurodac is to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences, when there is a substantiated suspicion that the perpetrator of a terrorist or other serious criminal offence has applied for international protection. Authorities responsible for internal security may query Eurodac in cases where there is an overriding public security concern, that is, if the act committed by the criminal or terrorist to be identified is so reprehensible that it justifies a database that registers persons with a clean criminal record, and it concluded that the threshold for querying criminal databases must therefore always be significantly higher than the threshold for querying criminal databases. Requests for comparisons of data with Eurodac on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the idioscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene, must be made by a designated authority in an EU country. Requests for comparison of data with Eurodac on the basis of a latent fingerprint, which is the idioscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene, must be made by a designated authority in an EU country.

Noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports Noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EC) No 677/2011 on noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It aims to facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives, including health aspects, at the level of individual airports, while respecting relevant EU rules, in particular those laid down in Directive 2002/49/EC, and the legislation within each EU country. It also aims to enable the use of operating restrictions as part of the noise management process so as to enable the sustainable development of the EU’s air transport network. KEY POINTS Regulation (EC) No 677/2011 sets out the process for identifying and adopting noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports. The process is based on the ‘Balanced Approach’ methodology, which takes into account the health and environmental aspects of the noise situation at the airport, as well as the operational capacity of the airport. The objective of the Balanced Approach is to identify measures which could immediately alleviate the noise impact without substantially affecting the operational capacity of an airport.

It sets out the investment priorities for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the period 2014-2024. KEY POINTS The ERDF is one of the main instruments of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and is designed to support the development of the regions of the European Union (EU). The ERDF contributes to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions. Under that Article and the second and third paragraphs of Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the ERDF is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.

European Regional Development Fund — cross-border and transnational cooperation European Regional Development Fund — cross-border and transnational cooperation SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 on the European Regional Development Fund — cross-border and transnational cooperation WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out how the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can be used to support cross-border and transnational cooperation programmes. KEY POINTS The ERDF is one of the EU’s main regional development funds. It is designed to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions. Under that Article and the second and third paragraphs of Article 174EU, the ERDF is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 sets out specific provisions concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the ERDF, and defines the goals for those activities. The European Commission defines transnational cooperation areas having regard to actions needed to promote integrated territorial development. It is necessary to continue supporting or, as appropriate, to establish cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation with the EU’s neighbouring third countries, as such coopearation is an important regional development policy tool and should benefit the regions of the Member States which border third countries. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 sets out the resources allocated to each of the different components of the European territorial cooperation goal, while maintaining a significant concentration on cross-border cooperation, including each Member State’s share of the global amounts for cross-border and transnational cooperation, the potential available to Member States concerning flexibility between those components, and securing sufficient funding levels for outermost regions’ cooperation.

The regulation also applies to vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties, including vessels for which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting them to be without nationality. The regulation lays down the general rules and conditions for the application by the EU of the scheme adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) to control and enforce fishing activities in the waters of the NACA which lie beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the contracting parties (Denmark, France, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America). The regulation applies to vessels flying the flag of EU countries and operating in the waters of the NACA which lie beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the contracting parties (Denmark, France, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America). The scheme provides for control and enforcement measures applicable to vessels flying the flag of contracting parties and operating in the NACA, and arrangements for inspection at sea which include inspection and surveillance procedures and infringement procedures which must be implemented by the contracting parties. The scheme also comprises provisions to promote compliance by vessels flying the flag of a non-contracting party with the control and enforcement measures in order to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC. FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY? It has applied since 30 June 2009.
