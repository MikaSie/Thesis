Climate neutrality: a roadmap for a clean and more competitive Europe Climate neutrality: a roadmap for a clean and more competitive Europe SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out a framework for the irreversible and gradual reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and enhancement of removals by sinks regulated in EU law. It sets out a binding objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 in pursuit of the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. It also sets out a binding target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030. KEY POINTS The regulation sets out a binding objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 in pursuit of the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. It also sets out a binding target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030. The EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals regulated in EU law must be balanced within the EU at the latest by 2050, thus reducing emissions to net zero by that date, and the EU must aim to achieve negative emissions thereafter. The relevant EU institutions and the EU countries must prioritise swift and predictable emission reductions and, at the same time, enhance removals by natural sinks. The contribution of net removals to the EU 2030 climate target must be limited to 225 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The EU-wide carbon sink must be increased to a higher volume of its net carbon sink in 2030. The Commission must assess the consistency of EU measures with the climate-neutrality objective and the progress made by EU countries on adaptation. The Commission must also assess the consistency of EU measures with the long-term climate goal. The Commission must also assess the consistency of EU measures with ensuring progress on adaptation.

It establishes a new and reinforced programme for EU action in the field of health for the period 2021-2027. It aims to improve human health throughout the EU and to ensure a high level of protection of human health in all EU policies and activities. It aims to: improve and fostering health in the EU to reduce the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases; protect people in the EU from serious cross-border threats to health; improve the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicinal products and medical devices, and crisis-relevant products in the EU, and supporting innovation regarding such products; strengthen health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency; support integrated and coordinated work between EU countries; promote the implementation of best practices and promoting data sharing; reinforcing the healthcare workforce; tackle the implications of demographic challenges; advance digital transformation. KEY POINTS The programme is based on the One Health approach, which recognises that human health is connected to animal health and to the environment, and that actions to tackle threats to health must take into account those three dimensions. The programme supports: disease prevention and health promotion; addressing health determinants; improving mental health; and tackling the implications of demographic challenges. The programme also supports: the development, implementation and enforcement of EU health legislation; the provision of valid, reliable and comparable high-quality data for evidence-based decision-making and monitoring; the use of health impact assessments of other relevant EU policies; integrated work among EU countries, and in particular their health systems, including the implementation of high-impact prevention practices, supporting work on health technology assessment (HTA), and strengthening and scaling up networking through ERNs and other transnational networks, including in relation to diseases other than rare diseases, to increase the coverage of patients and improve the response to low prevalence and complex communicable and non-communicable diseases; supporting global commitments and health initiatives by reinforcing the EU’s support for actions by international organisations, in particular actions by the WHO, and fostering cooperation with non-EU countries. The programme is based on the Financial Regulation (EU) 2018/1046, which sets out the rules on grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts.

It aims to ensure that the EU’s prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in the euro area Member States and those non-euro area Member States who choose to participate in the Single Resolution Mechanism (SSM) and that those credit institutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality. KEY POINTS The regulation establishes a single resolution mechanism (SRM) for all banks and financial institutions established in the participating Member States. It enables the SRM to be applied to banks and financial institutions established in the participating Member States and subject to the supervision of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national authorities within the framework of the SSM. The SRM is interwoven with the process of harmonisation in the field of prudential supervision, brought about by the establishment of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) and the single rulebook on prudential supervision (Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8)). The regulation also establishes a single resolution fund (SRM) for all participating Member States. It is financed by bank contributions raised at national level and pooled at EU level in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and progressive mutualisation of those contributions (the ‘Agreement’). The regulation also establishes a Single Resolution Board (SRB) to take decisions in relation to significant entities or groups, entities or groups directly supervised by the ECB or cross-border groups. The SRM is based on the frameworks of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 and Directive 2014/59/EU. The SRM is a centralised power of resolution, entrusted to the Single Resolution Board and to the national resolution authorities. The SRM is interwoven with the process of harmonisation in the field of prudential supervision, brought about by the establishment of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) and the single rulebook on prudential supervision (Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8)).

It establishes a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between EU countries and non-EU countries on particular matters concerning the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations. It does not apply to agreements with non-EU countries if the EU has already concluded an agreement with the non-EU country concerned on the same subject matter. KEY POINTS Notification to the Commission Where a EU country intends to enter into negotiations in order to amend an existing agreement or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of this regulation, it must notify the Commission in writing of its intention at the earliest possible moment before the envisaged opening of formal negotiations. The notification must include, as appropriate, a copy of the existing agreement, the draft agreement or the draft proposal, and any other relevant documentation. The Commission must assess whether the EU country has a specific interest in concluding the agreement due to economic, geographic, cultural, historical, social or political ties between the EU country and the non-EU country concerned. If this is not the case, the Commission must assess whether all of the following conditions are met: the EU country concerned has provided information showing that it has a specific interest in concluding the agreement due to economic, geographic, cultural, historical, social or political ties between the EU country and the non-EU country concerned; on the basis of the information provided by the EU country, the envisaged agreement appears not to render EU law ineffective and not to undermine the proper functioning of the system established by that law; and the envisaged agreement would not undermine the object and purpose of the EU’s external relations policy as decided by the EU. If the EU country does not request the Commission to enter into discussions with it, it must give an opinion to the EU country concerned within 90 days of receipt of the opinion. If the EU country does not request the Commission to enter into discussions with it, it must give a reasoned decision on the application of the EU country within 130 days of the closure of the discussions.

It aims to create an online dispute resolution (ODR) platform to help consumers and traders resolve disputes arising from online sales and service contracts. It aims to improve the quality of online transactions and to boost consumer confidence in the digital dimension of the EU’s internal market. KEY POINTS The regulation applies to the out-of-court resolution of disputes concerning contractual obligations stemming from online sales or service contracts between a consumer resident in the EU and a trader established in the EU through the intervention of an ADR entity listed in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU and which involves the use of the ODR platform. The regulation establishes an ODR platform (ODR platform) which enables consumers and traders to submit complaints to an ADR entity. The platform provides an electronic complaint form which can be filled in by the complainant party, informs the respondent party about the complaint, identify the competent ADR entity or entities and transmit the complaint to the ADR entity, which the parties have agreed to use, in accordance with Article 9 of the regulation. The platform also provides an electronic case management tool free of charge, which enables the parties and the ADR entity to conduct the dispute resolution procedure online through the ODR platform. The platform also provides an electronic form by means of which ADR entities shall transmit the information referred to in point (c) of Article 10 of the regulation. The platform also provides an online guide about how to submit complaints through the ODR platform. The regulation establishes a network of ODR contact points which provide support to the resolution of disputes relating to complaints submitted through the ODR platform. The ODR contact points provide support to the resolution of disputes relating to complaints submitted through the ODR platform by fulfilling the following functions: if requested, facilitating communication between the parties and the competent ADR entity, which may include, in particular: assisting with the submission of the complaint and, where appropriate, relevant documentation; providing the parties and ADR entities with general information on consumer rights in relation to sales and service contracts which apply in the EU of the ODR contact point which hosts the ODR advisor concerned; providing information on the functioning of the ODR platform; providing the parties with explanations on the procedural rules applied by the ADR entities identified; informing the complainant party of other means of redress when a dispute cannot be resolved through the ODR platform. The regulation also establishes a network of ODR contact points which enable cooperation between contact points and contribute to the performance of the functions listed in the regulation. The regulation also establishes a database of information on ADR entities and their updates. The regulation also establishes a committee to assist the Commission in implementing the regulation.
