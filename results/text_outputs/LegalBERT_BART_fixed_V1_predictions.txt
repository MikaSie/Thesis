Summary 5:
Hosting service providers exposed to terrorist content must inform the competent authorities of the removal of the content or the disabling of access to the terrorist content in all EU countries.
ACT
Council Regulation (EU) 2017/852 of 25 November 2017 on hosting service providers and users’ trust in the online environment
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
   
 
It sets out the procedures for the identification and removal of terrorist content hosted on a hosting service provider’s premises.
KEY POINTS
The regulation defines ‘terrorist content’ as material provided by a content provider that is considered to be a threat to the safety or security of the European Union (EU).
To identify terrorist content, the competent authority of the EU country in which the content is hosted must issue a removal order.
The competent authority must then inform the hosting provider of the reason for the removal order and the time of its removal or disabling.
Hosting providers must ensure that:
the content they host is not terrorist content;
the information they provide is protected by the protection of personal data, including human oversight and verifications, to avoid any unintended or erroneous decision leading to their removal of or disabling access to content that is terrorist content.
If a hosting provider fails to comply with an order issued by an EU country, it may be subject to an effective remedy.
Procedure for cross-border removal orders
EU countries must exchange information, coordinate and cooperate with each other and, where appropriate, with Europol, with regard to removal orders, in particular to avoid duplication of effort, enhance coordination and avoid interference with investigations in different Member States.
A host provider must inform a competent authority within 3 working days of receiving an order to remove or disable terrorist content or to disable access to it in all the EU countries, indicating, in the template set out in the regulation, the time that the order was issued and the location where it was issued.
An EU country may also issue a non-exhaustive list of the countries in which an order has been issued or which it is likely to be issued in order to identify and remove terrorist content and to enable EU countries to share information on the content that has been removed or disabled.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?

EU anti-dumping rules — non-tariff measures against imports of certain goods from non-EU countries (Regulation (EU) No 182/2011)
EU anti dumping rules — nomenclature
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2011/48/EU on the application of the rules of the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It lays down the rules for the imposition of anti-duty (AD) duties on imports of some goods originating outside the European Union (EU).
It aims to protect the EU’s internal market from the dumping of products originating outside its territory.
It also aims to ensure fair competition in the EU market.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to imports originating from:
the EU countries;
the countries of the Western Pacific (WAP) and the South Pacific (SAP) regions; and
the Republics of Mongolia, North Korea, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Imports are subject to a duty on the export price of the product exported to the EU.
The duty is calculated on the basis of a fair comparison between the normal price and the normal value of the imported product.
Duty may be imposed on imports if:
there is reason to believe that the imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within such a market; or
the producers of the products are not producing enough to cover the costs of the import.
An investigation is launched by the European Commission. The Commission may decide to suspend or impose a duty if it considers that the import is causing injury or that the production of the goods concerned is being under-utilised or under-exploited.
If the Commission considers that an investigation is necessary, it may impose a provisional duty. The provisional duty may be suspended or imposed if there is reason that an undertaking is being breached, or in the case of breach or withdrawal of an undertaking, where the investigation which led to the investigation has not been concluded.
Provisional duties may also be imposed if the following conditions are met:
an import price is lower than that of the exporting country;
an export price is higher than the import price;
a producer is not producing the product for the importing country.
EU countries must notify the Commission of any import charges or indirect taxes that they have charged or refunded on the imports of the same product. The import charges and indirect taxes must be made subject to registration for a period of no more than 9 months.
Where the Commission finds that an importing country has not complied with the import duties, it must inform the EU countries of this. The EU countries must then inform the Commission and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The Commission may also decide to impose a definitive duty on imports that are not covered by the regulation. The definitive duty is the highest level of duty applicable to imports of a product from outside the EU that are covered by this regulation.
FROM WHEN DO THE DIRECTIVES APPLY?
Directives 2011/49/EU and 2011/52/EU have applied since 1 July 2011.

KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all active substances* and products containing active substances. It does not apply to active substances intended for use in food or animal feed.
Authorisation
EU countries must authorise active substances only when it is necessary to control that serious danger to plant health in their territory.
The EU countries must ensure that:
the active substance or plant protection product meets the criteria of a ‘foodstuff’ as defined in Article 2 of Directive 91/414/EEC (see summary);
the product has been tested or studied to determine whether it poses a risk to human health;
it meets the requirements of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
The competent EU country may refuse to authorise an active substance if it considers that it does not meet the criteria for a foodstuff. It must inform the European Commission and the EFSA of its decision.
Applying for an authorisation
An applicant must submit a dossier containing:
a list of the active substances, synergists* and adjuvants;
a description of the product;
an estimate of the risk of human exposure to the active substance, synergist* or adjuvant;
information on the safety of the products; and
a risk assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the plant protection system.
An EU country must examine the application and decide whether to grant or deny authorisation.
If an EU country decides to grant authorisation, the applicant must provide the EU country with all the information necessary to carry out the risk assessment. If the applicant does not provide the necessary information, the EU countries may refuse authorisation to the product.
Derogations
An application for authorisation may be refused if:
it does not comply with the essential safety requirements; or
it is likely to endanger human health or the environment; or or
there is a risk of serious adverse effects on the plant.
A derogation may also be granted if the applicant fails to provide the required information.

It does not apply to:
non-EU countries, such as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, which have jurisdiction to rule on the substance of the matter in accordance with the relevant rules of jurisdiction applicable.
The creditor must obtain a judgment or court settlement before the creditor can issue a preservation order.
If the creditor has not yet obtained a judgment and/or an authentic instrument, the creditor is entitled to issue a Preservation Order.

It must also contain:
the amount of the judgment and the court settlement;

An order may be refused if the creditor:
does not have the necessary funds to execute the order or if the order has not been executed;

is not enforceable.
A creditor may refuse to enforce the order if the debtor:
has not paid the amount due to the creditor or has not paid a security deposit or an alternative assurance;
has failed to pay the security or the alternative assurance or a mortgage.
In the event that the creditor fails to satisfy these conditions, he or she may ask the court of the country of origin to order that the order be executed.
Where the creditor does not have funds in his or her account or accounts, he/she may make a request for account information. The creditor may also do so in the absence of such a request.
When a creditor refuses to execute an order, the debtor has the right to appeal the decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The court of CJEU may, however, refuse to issue an order if it considers that the debtor does not meet the following conditions:
he/she is not a resident in the country where the order is to be executed,
the order has been executed by a person other than the creditor,
he or she has not provided the creditor with sufficient funds for the purpose of executing the order, or

Protected designs of origin (PDOs and PGI) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSPs) — the labelling of products linked to a geographical area
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — rules for protected designations and protected geographic indications
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules for the protection of trade marks, designations* and geographical indications (PGIs) on foodstuffs.
It aims to ensure fair returns for producers of goods linked to an EU geographical area by:
ensuring uniform protection of the names as an intellectual property right in the territory of the EU;
providing clear information on the value-adding attributes of the product to consumers.
KEY POINTS
Protection
The protection of PDOs and PGIs is based on a set of principles:
the protection of intellectual property rights (IP rights) is guaranteed by the EU countries;
the use of the protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication is permitted as long as it does not infringe on the rights of the producers of the products.
The EU countries must ensure that PDOs or PGIs are used only on products that are produced in the EU and that they do not appear on products which are produced outside the EU.
Labelling
PDOs or PGI’s must be accompanied by a product specification. The product specification must state the name of the producer and the geographical area where the PDO or PGI originates.
If a PDO is used as an ingredient in a product, the product must be labelled as ‘PDO’ or ‘PGI’.
A PDO, PGI or TSP must not be used on a product which is produced in a non-EU country and which is not produced in an EU country.
An EU country may require that a protected PDO be used for a product that is produced outside its territory.
EU countries must set up a quality scheme for PDOs, PGIs and TSPs. The quality scheme must be established by the competent national authority of the country in which the PDOs/PGIs originate. The EU country responsible for the quality scheme is responsible for ensuring that the protected PDOs / PGI are used for the intended purpose.

Fishing in EU waters of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (2014-2020)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules for fishing in European Union waters (EU waters) of the north and Baltic seas.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all stocks of species in the North and Baltic Seas (North Sea and Baltic Sea) which are covered by the EU fisheries policy.
It sets out the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and the maximum biomass (MBSY) that can be harvested by EU countries.
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the regulation.
EU countries must ensure that the MSY and MBSY are maintained at levels that are sustainable for the long-term.
Fisheries must take into account the difficulty of fishing all stocks at MSY at the same time, especially in situations where that leads to a premature closure of the fishery.
Management of by-catch stocks must be managed in a way that minimises the impact of the by-catches on the overall MSY.
In addition, EU countries must take account of the likely catch composition of vessels participating in mixed fisheries.
A management plan must be drawn up by the European Commission and the International Commission for the Law of the Sea (ICES).
The plan must contain a range of FMSY and biomass reference points, i.e. the maximum yield and maximum biomass of the stocks concerned. The ranges must be set at the level of MSY in normal use and, provided that the stock concerned is considered to be in a good state, an upper limit for certain cases.
An EU country must notify the Commission and ICES of the ranges and the capacity ceilings that it has set for its fisheries. The Commission must inform the European Parliament and the Council of its decision to adopt a delegated act.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?

Summary 133:
EU countries may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins.
EU countries can issue 2-euro commemorative coins to celebrate specific subjects.
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the issuing of euro coins in the European Union (EU).
It aims to ensure that euro coins are legal tender in all EU countries whose currency is the euro.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to euro coins:
circulation coins intended for circulation, which are intended to commemorate a specific subject as specified in Article 1h of the regulation;
collector coins* intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.
Issuance of circulation coins
The euro coin must comply with the regulation’s technical specifications, including the denominations and technical specifications.
Collector coins may be put on the market above face value if justified by the special quality of the coin, a special packaging or any additional services provided.
The issuances of collector coins are accounted for in the volume of coins to be approved by the European Central Bank, but on an aggregate basis rather than for each individual issue.
Importers of euro collector coins must ensure that they comply with all the technical specifications set out in the regulation.
They must not have a shaped edge with fine scallops or a ‘Spanish flower’ shape.
In order to avoid that fit euro circulation coins are destroyed by one EU country while there may be a need of such coins in another, EU countries should consult each other prior to the destruction of these coins. The decision whether to issue commemorative euro coins with a common design collectively issued by EU countries is taken by the Council.
Exemptions
The European Commission may exempt from the regulation certain types of coins from the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1082/2013 (see summary).
The Commission may also exempt certain pieces of euro commemorative coin from the requirement to comply with certain technical specifications (e.g. the design of the obverse of a coin must not be different from that of a regular coin).

Beneficies recipients in the European Union (EU) are entitled to receive benefits in kind when they are injured or unable to work.
ACT
Commission Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 496/2004 of 30 November 2004 on the access to social security benefits by persons in the territory of a debtor Member State.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rights of persons who have been injured or cannot work in another EU country.
It aims to ensure that people who have received social welfare assistance in one EU country during a period in which he was entitled to benefits under the legislation of another EU State are able to reclaim the benefits due to them.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all persons covered by the social security system in the EU.
Claimants must submit a claim to the institution of the EU country to which they were last compulsorily subject before the accident.
The claimant must provide the relevant information, such as the date of the accident, the place of residence and the amount of benefits paid.
If the claimant fails to provide the information, the institution designated by the competent authority of that EU country of residence may forward the claim to another institution. If the claimant does not provide all the information required, the first institution may refuse the claim on grounds of invalidity or the aggravation of such invalidity.
In the event that the claimant is unable to provide all of the information necessary to make a claim, the creditor institution may deduct the undue amount from the arrears or on-going payments owed to the person concerned regardless of the national social security branch under which the benefit is paid. The creditor institution is responsible for the payment of the benefits to the claimant under type A legislation.
Where the claimant has not provided all the necessary information, a claim must be submitted to the national institution of which he or she was last compulsorsily subject. The claimant must submit the claim within 18 months of the date on which the accident occurred.
When a claimant is not able to work, the claimant must be able to claim benefits under type B legislation. In the case of type C legislation, where the claimant was compulsorsy to work at the time when the accident took place, the person must be entitled to claim the benefits paid under type D legislation. However, in type E legislation, a claimant may not claim benefits if:
the claimant was not able or could not work at that time;
the person was not entitled to work before that period; or
the claim was made before the period of incapacity or the person was no longer able or capable to work;
there was a period of time during which the persons concerned were, because of their residence in the country of creditor EU State, eligible to receive benefit in kind in that territory at the expense of the debtor EU State. If a claimant was unable or could no longer work, he/she must claim benefits in type B or type C.
Creditors may charge interest on late payments and down payments on outstanding claims. They may also refuse to pay the full costs of benefits cost of treatment incurred by the insured person up to the amount by which the notional cost exceeds the actual cost.
Cooperation between authorities and institutions
EU countries must cooperate with each other in order to assess all relevant information and to consult the reports and any other documents relating to the accident or the invalidity of the claimant.
Each EU country must notify the claimant of the decision it has taken in accordance with the applicable legislation. EU countries must also cooperate with the European Commission to ensure the application of the basic regulation and the implementing regulation.

EU-Iceland agreement on extradition
EU-Ireland agreement on extraditable cooperation
SUMMARY OF:
Agreement on extradition between the EU and its Member States, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Iceland, on behalf of the European Union
Decision (EU) 2017/852 concluding the Agreement on extradition of persons between the European Economic Area (EEA) and Iceland
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to ensure that EU citizens who are the subject of an EU arrest warrant or an arrest warrant for a non-EU country are extradited to the EU.
The decision concludes the agreement between the EEA and the EU countries, Norway and Iceland.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must inform each other of their competent authorities when an EU country issues a European arrest warrant (EAW) for an EU citizen. The EAW may be issued for the purposes of prosecution or for execution of a custodial sentence or detention order.
An EU country may issue an EAW for an individual who is a national of another EU country. The EU country must inform the EU country which issued the EAW.
If two or more EU countries have issued EAWs for the same person, the decision as to which of the arrest warrants shall be executed shall be taken by the executing judicial authority with due consideration of all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of the offences, the respective dates of the warrant and whether the warrant has been executed for the purpose of prosecution.
A judicial authority may refuse to execute an execution warrant if it considers that:
the person is a flight risk or a danger to the safety of the EU; or
the arrest warrant has not been executed in accordance with the law of the country in which the person is resident.
In the event of a refusal to execute the arrest warrant, the person must be informed of the reasons for the refusal and of the legal remedies available to him or her. If the person has been convicted of a criminal offence, he or she must be given the opportunity to appeal against the decision.
Where a judicial authority considers that the person cannot be brought before a court, it may postpone or conditional surrender the person. The person may also be refused to surrender if:
he or she has committed a serious criminal offence or is suspected of having committed a significant number of criminal offences;
the country in question has not applied the extradition system applicable before the entry into force of the agreement.
