It lays down rules for the use of energy-efficient labels on products intended for sale in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
The regulation aims to ensure that labels on energy efficiency products sold in the EU are clearly visible and clearly distinguishable from other products on the market.
It does not apply to products intended to be sold in non-EU countries.
EU countries must ensure that the label is easily recognisable, simple and concise.
Labels must include the following information:
the energy efficiency class of the product;
the number of units of the model in which the product falls into the top two energy efficiency classes A and B and further technological development can be expected;
a description of how the product is designed to reduce its energy consumption;
how the product complies with the EU’s 2030 climate and energy policy framework.
The label must be clearly visible on the product packaging and on the packaging itself.
A product database must be established to monitor compliance with the regulation.
Manufacturers and importers must provide the Commission with a product database containing information on the energy efficiency of the products they place on the EU market. The Commission must review the label with a view to rescaling if it estimates that:
30 % of the units of models belonging to a product group sold within the Union market fall within the top energy efficiency category A or B, or if 50 % of units fall into either class A or class B, but further technological progress is expected; or
50 % or more units of a model belonging to the same product group sell within the EU.
If the Commission considers that a product does not conform to the requirements of the regulation, it may further rescale the label.

KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU countries whose currency is the euro. It does not apply to non-euro-area countries.
EU countries must provide the Commission with a flash estimate of the HICP every 2 years.
The Commission must adopt implementing acts specifying the breakdown of the flash estimate by currency and the sub-index weights for the different indices.
Each year, EU countries must update the index weights for each of the indices and provide a report to the Commission on the quality of the data provided.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATING ACT APPLY?
  
It has applied since 1 January 2019.

MAIN DOCUMINVENTION
Council Regulation (EC) No 596/2014/EU — Harmonised price index
REFERNomenclature of the European Consumer Price Index (HCPI).
KEY TERMSUMINARY
The harmonised consumer price index is a composite index based on a number of categories of goods, such as foodstuffs, clothing and footwear. It is not intended to be a cost-of-living index.
It does not take into account the effect of tax rates on products.
In addition, the index does not include the prices charged by social security systems, social security schemes and social assistance schemes.
This regulation does not affect the calculation of the euro’s value added tax rate (VAT) or the value of social security contributions to the general budget of EU countries, which are subject to the same tax rates as national VAT rates.
HARMONISED INDICATIONS
The legislation sets out the rules for harmonising the indices. These rules apply from 1 January 2021.
These rules apply to the following categories of products:
foodstuffs;
medicinal products;
personal protective equipment;
goods and services;
services;
housing and utilities;
telecommunications and internet access;
other services; and
services.
National authorities must ensure that:
the data provided by EU countries are accurate and comparable;
there is no distortion of competition between EU countries’ national indices;
the quality of data provided is comparable and comparable to those provided by other EU countries;
data provided by the Commission are reliable and up-to-date;
information provided by national authorities is comparable to the national indices provided by Eurostat and Eurostat;
national authorities are responsible for ensuring that the data they provide comply with the requirements laid down in the legislation.
WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLYING?
From 1 January 2020. EU countries had to transmit the data for the period 2016 to 2016 by 31 December 2018.
From 31 December 2019, the Commission had to submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the suitability of the OOH price index to integrate into the HicP coverage. This report must be made available to the Council and the Commission by 31 March 2020. The Commission must also present a report in the light of the fact that the Commission has adopted implementing acts on the compatibility of these two indices with the other EU statistics.
Amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/856
From 30 June 2018, the regulation was amended to take account of the introduction of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) price index. This means that the OECD price index will now be included in the index. The OHD price index, which is based on the average price of food and services in the euro area, will be integrated into the index starting from 31 December 2020 and will be used for the first time in the second half of 2021. This amendment will allow the OHD index to be used as a reference for the euro-area indices. The new OOH index will replace the previous ODI price index which had to be replaced by the ODI in the first half of 2020.
Repeal
From 2 January 2020, the regulations will be repealed and replaced by Regulation (Euratom) 2020/854.

Resolution of insolvent financial institutions — common rules for equity holders and creditors
Resolving insolvency
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 596/2008 — common principles for resolution of insolvencies of financial institutions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
 
It aims to ensure that equity holders of a failing financial institution (i.e. a financial institution which is insolvent) and their creditors are not disadvantaged in the event of its resolution.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down common principles and procedures for the resolution of failing financial institutions (CCPs).
It applies to all financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies and pension funds.
It does not apply to banks and insurance companies.
EU countries must ensure that:
CCPs are able to draw up and implement a recovery plan for their equity holders;
the creditor losses are not greater than the losses that they would have incurred under normal insolvent proceedings;
securities and other assets of a CCP are not subject to liquidation proceedings.
In addition, the regulation sets out rules for the use of the position allocation and loss allocation tools (PAILs), which are designed to allow equity holders to absorb losses first in resolution in a way that minimises the risk of legal challenge by equity holders, on the basis that their losses in resolution are greater than their losses that would have suffered under normal bankruptcy proceedings according to the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle.
A resolution plan must be drawn up by the competent authorities of the CCP and its parent undertaking. It must also include:
a recovery plan;
a valuation of the equity holders’s assets and liabilities;
an objective and scope of the loss allocation and position allocation tools;
information to be provided by the creditor to equity holders on the structure and structure of the recovery plan.
The creditor losses must be absorbed by the CCP as soon as possible and not later than 30 days after the end of the bankruptcy proceedings. The creditor losses should not be greater than those of the creditor.
Where the creditor is not a shareholder in a CCP, the creditor should be entitled to a fair share of the proceeds of the resolution proceedings. However, this may not be more than 10% of the total value of the assets.
If the creditor does not benefit from the benefits of a resolution plan, he or she is entitled to the full amount of the capital that the creditor would have received under normal proceedings. If the creditor has not benefited from the benefit of a restructuring plan, they are entitled to full recovery of their losses.

Each year, Eurojust adopts a budget for the period 2014-2020. The budget must be approved by the executive board and the Commission. It must also adopt the programming document and the annual work programme, which must be adopted by the College.
EU funding may be frozen if the Commission considers that the budget does not meet the needs of the Commission or the EU institution, bodies or bodies concerned.
Amendments to the regulation
In 2018, the regulation was amended by Decision (EU/2018/EU) 2018/852 to take account of the fact that the Commission is no longer a member of the Eurojust Executive Board and that it has been replaced by the European Judicial Network (EJN). This means that the European Parliamentary and Council Committee on the Protection of Civil Liberties and Fundamental Freedoms is now responsible for implementing the regulation.
This amendment was adopted by Council Decision 2013/1482/EU on behalf of the Council.
Decisions 2013/15/EU and 2013/16/EU have been amended several times, most recently in 2018.

For more efficient and effective border control, the EU needs to develop cooperation between its customs authorities. This is achieved through the creation of a common customs programme.
This decision establishes a European Union customs programme to promote cooperation between European Union countries and their customs authorities, which is aimed at:
improving customs cooperation in the area of customs control;
developing customs cooperation at the level of the Commission;
promoting customs cooperation among EU countries in the fields of transport, customs administration, customs customs and customs information and communication technologies (ICTs);
encouraging customs cooperation on transport security, customs information technology (ICT) and customs data protection.
In addition, the programme aims to promote the use of the Common Communications Network (CCN) for customs cooperation.

Regulation (EC) No 596/2004 on the application of the laws of the Member States relating to the use of active substances
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules for the application and authorisation of substances for the manufacture of plant protection products.
It aims to ensure that substances used in plants are safe and effective.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to substances used to protect plants against the adverse effects of pesticides. It does not apply to substances intended for use in foodstuffs, such as food additives, which are covered by Directive 91/414/EEC (see summary).
It does not cover substances used for the production of food additives.
EU countries may apply different criteria for the first approval of an active substance than for the second approval of a substance.
The substances covered by the regulation are:
active substances, safeners, synergists and co-formulants*;
safer substances*; and
co-formulaants* and synergists*.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for evaluating the applications for the approval of substances.
Examination
The competent authority of an EU country examines the application for authorisation and decides within 12 months of receiving it whether the application meets the requirements.
If the competent authority in that country considers that the substance meets the criteria, it authorises the substance to be placed on the market. If not, it withdraws the substance from the application. If the competent authorities in the EU country examining the application decide that the application does not comply with the regulation.
An EU country may refuse to authorise a substance if it considers that:
the substance does not meet the requirements for the protection of plants;
it is likely to increase the risk of adverse reactions to the substance;
there is a risk that a substance may be used in combination with a substance that is not intended for plant protection; or
there are differences in the composition of the substance and the safety profile of the product.
A substance may not be used as a replacement for a substance which is already authorised.
In addition, EU countries may not prohibit the import of substances from non-EU countries which are not covered by this regulation, provided that the substances are not used in products intended for human consumption.

Cross-border transport of euro cash: cash-in-transit (CIT) and cash-carried out by police in the EU (until 31 December 2020)
Transport of euro banknotes and coins by cash-transport companies
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 596/2006 — cross-border cash transport
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the security of euro-denominated cash in the European Union (EU).
It lays down rules for the transport of cash by CIT companies (cash-carriers) between EU countries.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to the transport arrangements for the cash-transfer from one EU country to another.
It does not apply to:
cash-transporting operations carried out by the national police forces of the EU countries;
transport operations involving the police of the host EU country;
high-value point-to-point transport by the police; or
cash transport by police of a non-EU country.
CIT vehicles must be equipped with a global navigation system (GNSSN) and a device that allows them to be tracked at a remote distance by police;
the police must be notified to the police in advance of the operation.
EU countries must ensure that the CIT vehicle is accompanied by a security staff and that the vehicle is equipped with weapons and ammunition.
National police forces may carry out inspections of the vehicle during the transport. Such inspections may also be carried out in the host country’s territory.
The Commission may decide to grant prior authorisation to CIT to carry out such inspections.
FROMBanks, the large retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to contract with a cash-handling company that offers the best price and/or service and to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank (NCB) branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another EU country. The Commission must decide whether to grant such a contract within 72 hours of receipt of a request from the bank or the retail sector.
In addition, the Commission may authorise CIT vehicles to be accompanied by police officers from the police force of the country in which the operation is being carried out. If the police are present, they must be informed of the nature and duration of the transport operation and of the security measures to be taken.
Where cash is transported by a CIT company, it must be transported under the authority of a national police force or by a police officer from the country where the operation takes place. The police may also take part in the operation if they consider that it is necessary to protect the safety of the public, the economy or the national security.
A CIT security staff must be trained in the use of weapons, ammunition, explosives and other weapons and must be provided with the necessary training and equipment to ensure that they are used only in the event of a serious threat to public order or security. In addition, national police officers must be given the necessary equipment and training.
When a cash transport operation is carried out for the purpose of the safekeeping of cash, the police must carry out a risk assessment to determine whether it is possible to detect, prevent or detect the presence of cash. If they believe that there is a risk that cash may be stolen, they may take the necessary measures to prevent the cash from being taken or to confiscate the cash.
If the police believe that the cash is being transported for the purposes of a criminal offence, they should inform the national authorities and inform the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission.
This regulation is without prejudice to the application of national rules that require:
national police forces to be notified of cash transport operations;
national authorities to be informed in advance;
custodians of cash to be armed;
cash to be transported by police to ensure the safety and security of the police and the security staff;
vehicles to be fitted with a GPS system;
carriers to be escorted by police.
BACKGROUND
The CIT sector is one of the most important sources of cash for the euro area and is a key provider of services to the banking sector. CIT is also a major source of revenue for the EU as a whole.
For more information, see:
‘CIT’ (European Commission).

Compulsory insurance for passengers in maritime accidents
Compulsion insurance for passenger accidents
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2016/852 on compulsory insurance for damage caused to passengers in the event of a maritime accident
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to improve the protection of passengers when travelling by sea.
It lays down rules for compulsory insurance under the Athens Convention on maritime accidents.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to the liability of the carrier and the performing carrier of a passenger ship or a vehicle accompanying a vehicle or live animals which are covered by a contract for the carriage of goods not governed by this convention.
The liability rules are based on the principle of a global limitation of liability. Insurance companies must only be liable for their part of the damage caused, while the carrier is not liable for the loss or damage caused by the negligence of the passenger.
Insurance companies must:
provide passengers with a certificate of insurance or other security to show that they have insurance;
ensure that the insurance is sufficient to cover the total amount of damage caused;
notify passengers of any damage to their luggage or to their personal property;
keep a list of the places of business where the insurance and other security is established;
inform passengers of the place of business and of the type of insurance they are entitled to receive compensation.
A State Party may authorise an institution or an organisation recognised by it to issue a certificate to issue the certificate.
Compulsary insurance must be provided that:
the liability is limited to:
damage caused by an accident caused by a passenger;
loss or damage to luggage;
damage or loss to personal property caused by damage to a vehicle, live animals or goods not covered by the carriage contract;
damages caused to the vehicle or to live animals.
EU countries must ensure that the certificate is issued by an institution recognised by the State Party to the Convention and that it is accompanied by a copy of the relevant national law.
In addition, EU countries must: ensure that insurance companies provide passengers with information on the type and nature of the insurance they have provided;
make sure that the information is provided in the most appropriate format;
use the most up-to-date information available;
take all necessary measures to ensure that passengers are provided with the information they need to make an informed decision on whether to claim compensation for damage or loss caused to their property.
Liability of carriers and performing carriers
Carriers and the carriers’ performing carriers are liable only for damage to passengers.
Performing carriers and their performing carriers may not be held liable for damage that is caused by negligence on the part of their passengers. The liability burden is on the claimant to prove fault or neglect on their part.
Defendants may also be liable if they fail to take the necessary preventive measures to prevent damage to the passengers’ personal property. In such cases, the claimant may seek compensation from the carrier.
Where damage is caused to a passenger’s personal property, the defendant is liable only if the damage was caused as a result of negligence by the carrier or the performing carriers. The carrier is also liable if it was negligent when it failed to provide the passenger with the necessary information to make a decision on the insurance.
Persons who have been injured or who have lost their property are also liable. However, the burden of proof lies with the claimant if it is proved that the negligence was due to the negligence or fault of the claimant.

Convention in the field of consumer protection
SUMMARY OF:
Decision 98/852/EC on the conclusion of the Convention in the area of consumer Protection
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION AND OF THE DECISION?
The convention aims to ensure that the courts of the European Union (EU) countries that are party to it have jurisdiction over judgments issued by a court in another EU country.
The decision approves the convention on behalf of the EU.
KEY POINTS
The Convention applies to all EU countries that have ratified the Convention. It does not apply to the EU countries which have not yet ratified it.
Jurisdiction
EU countries must ensure that their courts have jurisdiction to enforce judgments issued in their country of origin. The judgments must be classified and provided with an abstract.
Judges must be delivered in the country in which the judgment has been or is to be enforced. The judgment must contain the following information:
the nature of the judgment;
the judgment’s subject matter; and
the date of entry into force.
If the judgment is delivered in another country, the judgment may be enforced in that country, provided that that country has jurisdiction over the judgment.
Where a judgment has not been and is to enforce the judgment in the judgment must be brought before the court of the country where the judgment was delivered.
In proceedings in which a judgment was issued, the court hearing the action must apply Article 26 of the convention.
When a judgment is brought before a court of a country bound by the convention, that court must apply the convention in the case where it has been issued.
A judgment may also be brought against a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence or who is the subject of a civil or commercial offence. The court of that country must also have jurisdiction in that case. If the outcome of proceedings in that court depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition that court shall have jurisdiction.
Consumer contracts
The courts of an EU country that has not ratified the convention have jurisdiction when a consumer contract is entered into. The contract must be entered into by the consumer in writing and the consumer must be informed of the terms and conditions of the contract before the contract is signed. The consumer must also be provided with a copy of all the relevant documents.
