Online transmission of TV programmes and retransmission of TV programmes
Online transmission of TV programmes and retransmission of TV programmes
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/789 – laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes, and amending Council Directive 93/83/EEC
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It aims to enhance access to a greater number of television and radio programmes across the EU by facilitating the clearance of rights for the provision of online services that are ancillary to the broadcast of certain types of television and radio programmes, and for the retransmission of television and radio programmes.
KEY POINTS
The directive lays down rules that aim to enhance cross-border access to a greater number of television and radio programmes, by facilitating the clearance of rights for the provision of online services that are ancillary to the broadcast of certain types of television and radio programmes, and for the retransmission of television and radio programmes.
The directive applies to:
ancillary online services, which consist in the provision to the public of television or radio programmes simultaneously with or for a defined period of time after their broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, as well as of any material which is ancillary to such broadcast;
retransmissions of television or radio programmes originating in another EU country.
The directive provides for a mandatory collective management of rights for certain types of programmes for retransmission services and for the transmission of programmes through the process of direct injection.
The directive does not oblige broadcasting organisations to provide such services across borders or operators of retransmission services to include in their services television or radio programmes originating in other EU countries.
The directive does not oblige broadcasters to provide such services across borders or operators of retransmission services to include in their services television or radio programmes originating in other EU countries.
The acts of communication to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, and of making available to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, occurring when providing to the public:
radio programmes;
television programmes which are:
news and current affairs programmes; or
fully financed own productions of the broadcasting organisation,
in an ancillary online service by or under the control and responsibility of a broadcasting organisation, as well as the acts of reproduction of such works or other protected subject matter which are necessary for the provision of, the access to or the use of such online service for the same programmes shall, for the purposes of exercising copyright and related rights relevant for those acts, be deemed to occur solely in the Member State in which the broadcasting organisation has its principal establishment.
Point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the broadcasts of sports events and works and other protected subject matter included in them.
Member States shall ensure that rightholders may exercise their right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission only through a collective management organisation.
Where a rightholder has not transferred the management of the right referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 to a collective management organisation, the collective management organisation which manages rights of the same category for the territory of the Member State for which the operator of a retransmission service seeks to clear rights for a retransmission shall be deemed to have the right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission for that rightholder.
However, where more than one collective management organisation manages rights of that category for the territory of that Member State, it shall be for the Member State for the territory of which the operator of a retransmission service seeks to clear rights for a retransmission to decide which collective management organisation or organisations have the right to grant or refuse the authorisation for a retransmission.
Member States shall ensure that a rightholder has the same rights and obligations resulting from an agreement between an operator of a retransmission service and a collective management organisation or organisations that act pursuant to paragraph 2, as rightholders who have mandated that collective management organisation or organisations. Member States shall also ensure that that rightholder is able to claim those rights within a period, to be fixed by the Member State concerned, which shall not be shorter than three years from the date of the retransmission which includes his or her work or other protected subject matter.
Member States shall ensure that Article 4 does not apply to the rights in retransmission exercised by a broadcasting organisation in respect of its own transmission, irrespective of whether the rights concerned are its own or have been transferred to it by other rightholders.
Member States shall provide that, where broadcasting organisations and the operators of retransmission services enter into negotiations regarding authorisation for retransmission under this Directive, those negotiations are to be conducted in good faith.
Member States shall ensure that it is possible to call upon the assistance of one or more mediators as provided for in Article 11 of Directive 93/83/EEC where no agreement is concluded between the collective management organisation and the operator of a retransmission service, or between the operator of a retransmission service and the broadcasting organisation regarding authorisation for retransmission of broadcasts.
Member States may provide that the rules in this Chapter and in Chapter III of Directive 93/83/EEC apply to situations where both the initial transmission and the retransmission take place within their territory.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It applies from 10 July 2020.

Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/784 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure the smooth functioning of the digital single market in an open and democratic society by addressing the misuse of hosting services for terrorist purposes and contributing to public security across the Union.
It establishes a definition of ‘terrorist content’ for preventative purposes and provides for specific measures to address the dissemination of terrorist content online.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to providers of information society services that store and disseminate to the public information and material provided by a user of the service on request, irrespective of whether the storing and dissemination to the public of such information and material is of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature.
The regulation does not apply to providers of ‘mere conduit’ or ‘caching’ services, as well as to providers of domain name systems (DNS), payment or distributed denial of service (DdoS) protection services.
Definition of terrorist content
The regulation defines ‘terrorist content’ as material that incites or solicits someone to commit, or to contribute to the commission of, terrorist offences, solicits someone to participate in activities of a terrorist group, or glorifies terrorist activities including by disseminating material depicting a terrorist attack.
It also includes material that provides instruction on the making or use of explosives, firearms or other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) substances, or on other specific methods or techniques, including the selection of targets, for the purpose of committing or contributing to the commission of terrorist offences.
When assessing whether material constitutes terrorist content within the meaning of this regulation, competent authorities and hosting service providers take into account factors such as the nature and wording of statements, the context in which the statements were made and their potential to lead to harmful consequences in respect of the security and safety of persons.
The fact that the material was produced by, is attributable to or is disseminated on behalf of a person, group or entity included in the Union list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts and subject to restrictive measures constitutes an important factor in the assessment.
Specific measures
The regulation provides for a number of specific measures to address the dissemination of terrorist content online, including:
a requirement to preserve the removed content and related data for a period of 6 months in order to allow content providers sufficient time to initiate administrative or judicial review proceedings and to enable access by law enforcement authorities to relevant data for the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences;
a requirement to establish user-friendly complaint mechanisms and ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously and in full transparency towards the content provider;
a requirement to publish annual transparency reports containing information about action taken in relation to the identification and removal of terrorist content;
a requirement to put in place specific measures taking into account the risks and level of exposure to terrorist content as well as the effects on the rights of third parties and the public interest to information.
Competent authorities
The regulation requires the designation of competent authorities by the Member States. The competent authorities fulfil their tasks in an objective and non-discriminatory manner and do not seek or take instructions from any other body in relation to the exercise of the tasks under this regulation.
The Commission publishes a register listing the competent authorities designated under this regulation.
Removal orders
The regulation provides for a procedure and obligations resulting from removal orders requiring hosting service providers to remove or disable access to terrorist content, following an assessment by the competent authorities.
The competent authority submits the removal order directly to the contact point designated or established by the hosting service provider for the purposes of this regulation by any electronic means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the hosting service provider to establish the authenticity of the order, including the accuracy of the date and the time of sending and receipt thereof.
The competent authority should provide the hosting service provider with information on procedures and applicable deadlines at least 12 hours in advance of issuing for the first time a removal order to that hosting service provider.
Where the hosting service provider cannot comply with the removal order within one hour of its receipt, on grounds of force majeure or de facto impossibility, including for objectively justifiable technical or operational reasons, it should inform the issuing competent authority as soon as possible and comply with the removal order as soon as the situation is resolved.
The removal order should contain a statement of reasons qualifying the material to be removed or access to which is to be disabled as terrorist content and provide sufficient information for the location of that content, by indicating the exact URL and, where necessary, any other additional information, such as a screenshot of the content in question.
The competent authority should submit the removal order directly to the contact point designated or established by the hosting service provider for the purposes of this regulation by any electronic means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the hosting service provider to establish the authenticity of the order, including the accuracy of the date and the time of sending and receipt thereof, such as by secured email or platforms or other secured channels, including those made available by the hosting service provider, in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data.
It should be possible for the competent authority of the Member State where the hosting service provider has its main establishment or where its legal representative resides or is established to scrutinise the removal order issued by competent authorities of another Member State to determine whether it seriously or manifestly infringes this regulation or the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.
Penalties
The regulation provides for the possibility for the competent authorities to impose penalties on hosting service providers that fail to comply with the requirements of this regulation. The penalties may include fines and/or other penalties, such as the suspension or revocation of licences or authorisations.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 7 July 2021.

Regulation (EU) 2021/695 — the Horizon Europe Programme for research and innovation
Regulation (EU) 2021/695 — the Horizon Europe Programme for research and innovation
The Horizon Europe Programme is the new EU framework programme for research and innovation (R&I) for the period 2021-2027. It replaces the Horizon 2020 Programme, which ran from 2014 to 2020.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the Horizon Europe Programme for 7 years from 2021 to 2027.
KEY POINTS
The Horizon Europe Programme aims to:
strengthen the European Research Area (ERA) by improving the circulation of researchers and knowledge;
deliver on the EU’s strategic priorities and commitments;
support the EU’s values and the well-being of its citizens;
deliver scientific, technological, economic, environmental and societal impact in pursuit of these objectives.
The Programme will support the creation, better diffusion and transfer of high-quality and excellent knowledge and high-quality technologies in the EU, attract talent at all levels and contribute to full engagement of the EU’s talent pool, facilitate collaborative links and strengthen the impact of R&I in developing, supporting and implementing EU policies, support and strengthen the uptake and deployment of innovative and sustainable solutions in the EU’s economy, in particular in SMEs, and in society, address global challenges, including climate change and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), create jobs, boost economic growth, promote industrial competitiveness and boost the attractiveness of the EU in the field of R&I.
The Programme fosters all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, fosters market deployment of innovative solutions, and optimises the delivery of such investment for increased impact within a strengthened ERA.
The Programme will contribute to increasing public and private investment in R&I in the EU, thereby helping to reach an overall investment target of at least 3 % of the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development. Achieving that target would require EU countries and the private sector to complement the Programme with their own reinforced investment actions in research, development and innovation.
The Programme will benefit from complementarity with existing relevant European R&I roadmaps and strategies, as well as with important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs), where relevant, provided that related R&I needs are identified in the Programme’s strategic planning.
The Programme supports R&I activities in the field of social sciences and humanities (SSH). This entails advancing scientific knowledge in that domain and making use of insights and progress from SSH to increase the economic and societal impact of the Programme. Under the pillar ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’, SSH should be fully integrated across all clusters.
The Programme will support the EU’s industry in remaining or in becoming a world leader in innovation, digitisation and climate neutrality, in particular through investments in key enabling technologies that will underpin tomorrow’s business.
The Programme will support R&I in an integrated manner, respecting all relevant provisions in the framework of the World Trade Organization. The concept of research, including experimental development, should be used in accordance with the Frascati Manual developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), whereas the concept of innovation should be used in accordance with the Oslo Manual developed by the OECD and Eurostat, which follows a broad approach that covers social innovation and design. As in Horizon 2020, the OECD definitions regarding technological readiness levels (TRLs) should continue to be taken into account in the classification of technological research, product development and demonstration activities, and in the definition of types of action available in calls for proposals. Grants should not be awarded for actions where activities go above TRL 8. It should be possible for the work programme to allow grants for large-scale product validation and market replication for a given call under the pillar ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’.

 Digital Europe Programme
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/694 establishing the Digital Europe Programme and repealing Decision (EU) 2015/2240
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) for the period 2021-202Y. The DEP is a key component of the European Digital Strategy, which aims to transform and modernise European industry, public services and public administration.
KEY POINTS
              
The DEP has 5 specific objectives, which are:
high-performance computing (HPC) (1);
artificial intelligence (AI);
cybersecurity and trust;
advanced digital skills;
deployment and best use of digital capacities and interoperability.
The DEP supports the digital transformation of industry and the wider use of essential digital capacities, in particular in the fields of HPC, AI, cybersecurity and trust, and advanced digital skills.
The DEP is implemented through projects that reinforce and widen the use of essential digital capacities, such as HPC, AI and cybersecurity, and through European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs).
European Digital Innovation Hubs
The DEP establishes a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), which act as access points for the latest digital capacities, including HPC, AI, cybersecurity, as well as for other existing innovative technologies available in fablabs or citylabs. EDIHs act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation.
The network of EDIHs is established through an open and competitive process from among entities designated by Member States. The Commission takes the utmost account of the opinion of each Member State before selecting a European Digital Innovation Hub in the territory of that Member State. The Commission and the Member States should avoid the unnecessary duplication of competences and functions at Union and national level. There should therefore be adequate flexibility when designating the hubs and determining their activities and composition.
The network might be further enlarged through a subsequent open and competitive process.
The network of EDIHs should ensure broad geographical coverage across Europe and should contribute to the participation of the outermost regions in the Digital Single Market.
The European Commission sets up the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) in cooperation with Member States.

Summary 12:
 interoperability of electronic road toll systems and the exchange of information on failure to pay road fees
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/520 on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems and facilitating cross-border exchange of information on the failure to pay road fees in the Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure the interoperability of electronic road toll systems on the entire EU road network, urban and interurban motorways, major and minor roads, and various structures, such as tunnels or bridges, and ferries.
It also aims to facilitate the cross-border exchange of vehicle registration data regarding the vehicles and the owners or holders of vehicles for which there was a failure to pay road fees of any kind in the Union.
It introduces the European Electronic Toll Service (EETS) which aims to ensure the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the EU.
It does not apply to road toll systems which are not electronic within the meaning of point 10 of Article 2 of the directive.
It does not apply to small, strictly local road toll systems for which the costs of compliance with the requirements of the directive would be disproportionate to the benefits.
It does not apply to parking fees.
It does not apply to failure to pay parking fees.
It does not apply to failure to pay a road fee where the national law requires a notification to the user of the obligation to pay before a failure to pay a road fee can be established.
KEY POINTS

EU network of immigration liaison officers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1240 — on the creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to enhance the cooperation and coordination among immigration liaison officers* deployed to third countries by Member States, the European Commission and the European agencies by creating a European network of immigration liaison officers.
It also aims to ensure that immigration liaison officers better contribute to the functioning of a European network of immigration liaison officers by establishing a mechanism through which Member States, the Commission and European agencies can more systematically coordinate the tasks and roles of their liaison officers deployed in third countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation lays down rules to enhance cooperation and coordination among immigration liaison officers deployed to third countries by Member States, the Commission and European agencies, through the creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers.
It is without prejudice to the responsibility of Member State authorities, the Commission and European agencies for defining the scope and assignment of tasks and reporting lines of their respective immigration liaison officers, and to the tasks of immigration liaison officers within the framework of their responsibilities under Union and national law, policies or procedures, or under special agreements concluded with the host country or international organisations.
Tasks of immigration liaison officers
Immigration liaison officers shall carry out their tasks within the framework of their responsibilities determined by the deploying authorities and in accordance with the provisions, including those on the protection of personal data, laid down in Union and national laws and in any agreements or arrangements concluded with third countries or international organisations.
Immigration liaison officers shall carry out their tasks in accordance with fundamental rights as general principles of Union law as well as international law, including human rights obligations. They shall have particular consideration for vulnerable persons and take into account the gender dimension of migration flows.
Each deploying authority shall ensure that immigration liaison officers establish and maintain direct contacts with the competent authorities of third countries, including, when appropriate, with local authorities, and any relevant organisations operating within the third country, including international organisations, notably with a view to implementing this regulation.
Immigration liaison officers shall collect information, for use either at operational level, strategic level, or both. Information collected under this paragraph shall be collected in accordance with Article 1(2) and shall not contain personal data, without prejudice to Article 10(2). Such information shall cover the following issues in particular:
the European integrated border management at the external borders, with a view to managing migration effectively;
migratory flows originating from or transiting through the third country, including where possible and relevant, the composition of migratory flows and migrants’ intended destination;
routes used by migratory flows originating from or transiting through the third country in order to reach the territories of the Member States;
the existence, activities and modi operandi of criminal organisations involved in smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings along the migratory routes;
incidents and events that have the potential to be or to cause new developments with respect to migratory flows;
methods used for counterfeiting or falsifying identity documents and travel documents;
ways and means to assist the authorities in third countries in preventing illegal immigration flows originating from or transiting through their territories;
pre-departure measures available to immigrants in the country of origin or in host third countries that support successful integration upon legal arrival in Member States;
facilitating return, readmission and reintegration;
effective access to protection that the third country has put in place, including in favour of vulnerable persons;
existing and possible future legal immigration strategies and channels between the Union and third countries, taking into account skills and labour market needs in Member States, as well as resettlement and other protection tools;
capacity, capability, political strategies, legislation and legal practices of third countries and stakeholders, including, where possible and relevant, regarding reception and detention centres and the conditions therein, as relevant to the issues referred to in points (a) to (k).
Immigration liaison officers may render assistance, taking into account their expertise and training, in:
establishing the identity and nationality of third-country nationals and facilitating their return in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC, as well as assisting their reintegration, where relevant and possible;
confirming the identity of persons in need of international protection for the purposes of facilitating their resettlement in the Union, including by providing them, where possible, with adequate pre-departure information and support;
confirming identity and facilitating implementation of Union and national measures in respect of the admission of legal immigrants;
sharing information obtained in the course of their duties within networks of immigration liaison officers and with competent authorities of the Member States, including law enforcement authorities, in order to prevent and detect illegal immigration as well as combat smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings.
Notification of the deployment of immigration liaison officers
Member States, the Commission and the European agencies shall inform the Steering Board established in Article 7 of their plans for and actual deployment of immigration liaison officers, including a description of their duties and the duration of their deployment.
The activity reports referred to in point (c) of Article 8(2) shall include an overview of the deployments of immigration liaison officers.
Creation of local or regional networks of immigration liaison officers
Immigration liaison officers deployed to the same countries or regions shall constitute local or regional cooperation networks and cooperate, where and when appropriate, with liaison officers deployed by countries other than Member States. Within the framework of such networks, immigration liaison officers shall in accordance with Article 1(2), in particular:
meet regularly and whenever necessary;
exchange information and practical experience, in particular at meetings and via the secure web-based information exchange platform provided for in Article 9;
exchange information, where appropriate, on experience regarding access to international protection;
coordinate positions to be adopted in contacts with commercial carriers, where appropriate;
attend joint specialised training courses, when appropriate, including on fundamental rights, trafficking in human beings, smuggling of migrants, document fraud or access to international protection in third countries;
organise information sessions and training courses for members of the diplomatic and consular staff of the missions of the Member States in the third country, when appropriate;
adopt common approaches on methods for the collection and reporting of strategically relevant information, including risk analyses;
set up regular contacts with similar networks in the third country and in neighbouring third countries, as appropriate.
Immigration liaison officers deployed by the Commission shall facilitate and support the networks provided for in paragraph 1. In locations where the Commission does not deploy immigration liaison officers, immigration liaison officers deployed by European agencies shall facilitate and support the networks provided for in paragraph 1. In locations where neither the Commission nor European agencies deploy immigration liaison officers, the network shall be facilitated by an immigration liaison officer, as agreed by members of the network.
The Steering Board shall be notified without undue delay of the appointment of the designated network facilitator or where no facilitator is designated.
Joint deployment of immigration liaison officers
Member States may bilaterally or multilaterally agree that immigration liaison officers who are deployed to a third country or international organisation by a Member State shall also look after the interests of one or more other Member States.
Where two or more Member States jointly deploy an immigration liaison officer, those Member States may receive Union financial support pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 515/2014.
Steering Board
A Steering Board for a European network of immigration liaison officers is

Summary 17:
 European Electronic Communications Code
The European Electronic Communications Code aims to boost investment in very high capacity networks and to provide end-users with a better internet experience. It also aims to ensure the efficient use of radio spectrum and to make the internal market for electronic communications more predictable and more consistent.
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It establishes a European Electronic Communications Code. This code covers both the provision of electronic communications networks and services.
The directive covers all types of electronic communications networks and services, including those using radio spectrum.
The directive replaces 4 directives on the subject: the authorisation directive, the access directive, the universal service directive and the regulatory framework directive.
KEY POINTS
The directive establishes a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services in the EU. It aims to ensure that:
very high capacity networks are progressively rolled out across the EU;
end-users are provided with a better internet experience;
the radio spectrum is efficiently used;
the internal market for electronic communications is more predictable and consistent.
The directive defines 3 types of services which may partly overlap:
internet access services: these are services that enable subscribers or end-users to connect to a public communications network and access and exchange data using internet protocol technology.
interpersonal communications services: these are services that enable interpersonal and interactive exchange of information, covering services like traditional voice calls between two individuals but also all types of emails, messaging services, or group chats.
services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals: these are services that enable communications between a finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of natural persons, which is determined by the sender of the communication.
The directive also defines 3 types of networks:
fixed networks: these are networks which enable communications between end-users via a wired geography.
wireless networks: these are networks which enable communications between end-users via a wireless geography.
very high capacity networks: these are networks that are capable of providing at least 30 Mbps to each end-user, and which are promptly upgradeable to gigabit speeds.
The directive establishes a number of objectives for the national regulatory authorities. These are to:
ensure the availability of very high capacity networks across the EU;
ensure the availability of uninterrupted 5G coverage for urban areas and major terrestrial transport paths;
ensure that all households in each Member State have access to electronic communications networks which are capable of providing at least 100 Mbps and which are promptly upgradeable to gigabit speeds;
ensure that 5G coverage is available across the Union for the most important socio-economic drivers such as schools, transport hubs and major providers of public services, and highly digitised businesses.
The directive also establishes a number of principles that national regulatory authorities must respect. These are to:
ensure that the regulatory framework is technologically neutral;
ensure that the regulatory framework is market driven;
ensure that the regulatory framework is cost oriented;
ensure that the regulatory framework is risk based;
ensure that the regulatory framework is proportionate.
The directive establishes a number of principles that national regulatory authorities may respect. These are to:

Security of gas supply – EU legislation
SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLY – EU LEGISLATION
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It establishes a new legal framework to safeguard the security of gas supply in the EU. It replaces Regulation (EU) No 994/2010.
KEY POINTS
              
The security of gas supply in the EU is the responsibility of the EU, the Member States and the gas industry. It is achieved through the most cost-effective measures and in such a way that the gas market is not distorted.
The main objective of this regulation is to ensure an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the EU, in particular to protected customers in the event of difficult climatic conditions or disruptions of the gas supply.
The regulation defines risk groups based on the main gas supply sources and routes. It establishes a cooperation mechanism within each risk group to mitigate the identified risks and implement the most cost-effective measures for EU consumers. It also establishes a burden-sharing mechanism for solidarity measures.
The regulation also defines a new solidarity mechanism, which provides for solidarity between Member States to ensure gas supply to customers in the event of a crisis. This solidarity is a measure of last resort that applies only in an emergency and only under restrictive conditions.
The regulation requires Member States to ensure that gas customers are protected against the negative effects of a disruption of gas supply. It defines customers protected under the solidarity mechanism as households and certain essential social services.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for the Commission to request access to key gas supply contracts. It also establishes a mechanism for the Commission to assess the preventive action plans and the emergency plans.
The regulation establishes a common risk assessment mechanism to assess the risks to the security of gas supply. It establishes a common and national risk assessment mechanism to assess the risks to the security of gas supply.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for Member States to conduct tests in order to assess the emergency plans.
The regulation establishes a mechanism for Member States to update their preventive action plans and emergency plans.

Energy labelling: new rules for better energy efficiency
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It sets up a framework for the labelling of energy-related products and for the provision of standard product information on their energy consumption during use, in order to enable customers to choose more efficient products and reduce their energy consumption.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies to energy-related products placed on the market or put into service.
It provides for the labelling of those products and the provision of standard product information regarding energy efficiency, the consumption of energy and of other resources by products during use and supplementary information concerning products, thereby enabling customers to choose more efficient products in order to reduce their energy consumption.
The regulation does not apply to:
second-hand products, unless they are imported from a third country;
means of transport for persons or goods.
The regulation defines:
energy-related product (or product): a good or system with an impact on energy consumption during use which is placed on the market or put into service, including parts with an impact on energy consumption during use which are placed on the market or put into service for customers and that are intended to be incorporated into products;
product group: a group of products which have the same main functionality;
model: a version of a product of which all units share the same technical characteristics relevant for the label and the same model identifier;
model identifier: the code, usually alphanumeric, which distinguishes a specific product model from other models with the same trade mark or the same supplier’s name;
equivalent model: a model which has the same technical characteristics relevant for the label and the same product information sheet, but which is placed on the market or put into service by the same supplier as another model with a different model identifier;
making available on the market: the supply of a product for distribution or use on the EU market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge;
placing on the market: the first making available of a product on the EU market;
putting into service: the first use of a product for its intended purpose on the EU market;
manufacturer: a natural or legal person who manufactures a product or has a product designed or manufactured, and markets that product under its name or trademark;
authorised representative: a natural or legal person established in the EU who has received a written mandate from the manufacturer to act on its behalf in relation to specified tasks;
importer: a natural or legal person established in the EU who places a product from a third country on the EU market;
dealer: a retailer or other natural or legal person who offers for sale, hire, or hire purchase, or displays products to customers or installers in the course of a commercial activity, whether or not in return for payment;
supplier: a manufacturer established in the EU, the authorised representative of a manufacturer who is not established in the EU, or an importer, who places a product on the EU market;
energy efficiency: the ratio of output of performance, service, goods or energy to input of energy;
harmonised standard: standard as defined in point (c) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council;
label: a graphic diagram, either in printed or electronic form, including a closed scale using only letters from A to G, each letter representing a class and each class corresponding to energy savings, in seven different colours from dark green to red, in order to inform customers about energy efficiency and energy consumption; it includes rescaled labels and labels with fewer classes and colours in accordance with Article 11(10) and (11);
rescaling: an exercise making the requirements for achieving the energy class on a label for a particular product group more stringent;
rescaled label: a label for a particular product group that has undergone rescaling and is distinguishable from labels before rescaling while preserving a visual and perceptible coherence of all labels;
product information sheet: a standard document containing information relating to a product, in printed or electronic form;
technical documentation: documentation sufficient to enable market surveillance authorities to assess the accuracy of the label and the product information sheet of a product, including test reports or similar technical evidence;
supplementary information: information, as specified in a delegated act, on the functional and environmental performance of a product;
product database: a collection of data concerning products, which is arranged in a systematic manner and consists of a consumer-oriented public part, where information concerning individual product parameters is accessible by electronic means, an online portal for accessibility and a compliance part, with clearly specified accessibility and security requirements;
verification tolerance: the maximum admissible deviation of the measurement and calculation results of the verification tests performed by, or on behalf of, market surveillance authorities, compared to the values of the declared or published parameters, reflecting deviation arising from interlaboratory variation.
The supplier shall ensure that products that are placed on the market are accompanied, for each individual unit, free of charge, with accurate printed labels and with product information sheets in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant delegated acts.
The supplier shall deliver printed labels, including rescaled labels in accordance with Article 11(13), and product information sheets, to the dealer free of charge, promptly and in any event within five working days upon the dealer’s request.
Once a unit of a model is in service, the supplier shall request explicit consent from the customer regarding any changes intended to be introduced to the unit by means of updates that would be detrimental to the parameters of the energy efficiency label for that unit, as set out in the relevant delegated act. The supplier shall inform the customer of the objective of the update and of the changes in the parameters, including any change in the label class. For a period proportionate to the average lifespan of the product, the supplier shall give the customer the option of refusing the update without avoidable loss of functionality.
The supplier shall not place on the market products that have been designed so that a model’s performance is automatically altered in test conditions with the objective of reaching a more favourable level for any of the parameters specified in the relevant delegated act or included in any of the documentation provided with the product.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2017.

It establishes a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) and the house price index (HPI) at EU and national levels.
It replaces Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, which established a common framework for setting up harmonised indices of consumer prices.
The regulation takes into account the Commission's better regulation agenda and, in particular, the Commission communication of 8 October 2010 entitled Smart regulation in the European Union. In the statistical field, the Commission has set as a priority the simplification and improvement of the regulatory environment in statistics, as referred to in the Commission communication of 10 August 2009 on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) and the house price index (HPI) at EU and national levels.
The HICP is designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across EU countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in the EU.
Harmonised indices are used in the context of the Commission's macroeconomic imbalance procedure, as established by Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Price statistics of high quality and comparability are essential for those responsible for public policy in the EU, researchers and all European citizens.
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) uses the HICP as an index in order to measure the achievement of the ESCB's price stability objective under Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which is of particular relevance for the definition and implementation of the monetary policy of the EU under Article 127(2) TFEU. Pursuant to Articles 127(4) and 282(5) TFEU, the ECB is to be consulted on any proposed EU act in its fields of competence.

Dumped imports from non-EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1036/2016 — protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union
Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 — protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIMS OF THE REGULATION?
              
It codifies Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 which aims to ensure that dumped imports from countries outside the EU are not given unfair market advantages.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation defines ‘dumped imports’ as imports from non-EU countries which are sold at prices below those which prevail in the exporting country or, in the absence of such prices, in a third country.
The regulation provides that an anti-dumping duty may be imposed on any dumped product which causes injury to the domestic industry in the EU.
The regulation provides for the determination of dumping and of injury. In particular, the normal value shall normally be based on the prices paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, by independent customers in the exporting country.
The regulation provides for the termination of investigations or proceedings where the dumping is de minimis or the injury is negligible, and it specifies the method of calculating the level of measures in cases of sampling.
The regulation provides for the acceptance of undertakings which eliminate dumping and injury instead of imposing provisional or definitive duties. It also provides for the suspension of anti-dumping measures where there is a temporary change in market conditions which makes the continued imposition of such measures temporarily inappropriate.
The regulation provides for the termination of cases, irrespective of whether definitive measures are adopted or not, normally within 12 months, and in no case more than 15 months, of the initiation of the investigation.
The regulation provides for the imposition of provisional duties in cases where there is a danger of serious injury to the domestic industry, or where a threat of serious injury to the domestic industry is evident.
The regulation provides for the imposition of definitive duties in cases where injury is caused to the domestic industry.
The regulation provides for the reassessment of export prices and dumping margins where the duty is being absorbed by the exporter through a form of compensatory arrangement and the measures are not being reflected in the prices of the products subject to measures in the EU.
The regulation provides for the circumvention of anti-dumping measures in cases where practices, including mere assembly of goods in the EU or a third country, have as their main aim the circumvention of anti-dumping measures.
The regulation provides for the suspension of measures in cases where there is a temporary change in market conditions which makes the continued imposition of such measures temporarily inappropriate.

Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility
Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility
The Recovery and Resilience Facility (the Facility) aims to help EU countries address the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis and increase their resilience to future crises. The Facility is part of the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) initiative, which provides € 750 billion of new EU funds to support EU countries’ recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. The Facility is one of the main pillars of the NGEU initiative.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which provides financial support to EU countries to implement reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The Facility supports reforms and investments in the following areas:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Regulation also sets out the rules for EU countries to prepare and implement their national recovery and resilience plans.
KEY POINTS
The Recovery and Resilience Facility provides financial support to EU countries to implement reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The Facility supports reforms and investments in the following areas:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Regulation also sets out the rules for EU countries to prepare and implement their national recovery and resilience plans.
Recovery and resilience plans
To access the Facility, EU countries must prepare a national recovery and resilience plan (RRP) that sets out their reforms and investments to achieve sustainable growth and resilience. The RRP must be submitted to the Commission by 30 April 2021 at the latest.
EU countries may submit their draft RRP from 15 October 2020. The Commission assesses the RRP and informs the EU country of the outcome of that assessment. The Commission then adopts an implementing decision to approve or reject the RRP. The Council approves the Commission’s decision.
The Commission’s assessment is based on criteria set out in an annex to the Regulation. The assessment is based on 6 pillars:
green transition;
digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health;
economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, children and the youth.
The Commission assesses the extent to which the RRP:
is relevant, effective, efficient and coherent;
contributes to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights;
contributes to the implementation of the European Green Deal;
contributes to the implementation of the Digital Single Market;
contributes to the implementation of the European Pillar of Structural Reform;
contributes to the implementation of the European Semester;
contributes to the implementation of the European Industrial Policy Strategy;
contributes to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.
The RRP must also include an explanation of how it contributes to effectively addressing the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester, including fiscal aspects and recommendations made pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester, as well as challenges and priorities identified in the most recent Council recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area for Member States whose currency is the euro.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with National Reform Programmes, National Energy and Climate Plans, just transition plans, the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and the partnership agreements and operational programmes adopted under the Union funds.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP sets out measures that are relevant for the green and digital transitions.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP is consistent with the relevant objectives and priorities of the Multiannual Financial Framework.
The Commission assesses whether the RRP ensures that no measure for the implementation of reforms and investments included in that plan does significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the principle of ‘do no significant harm’).
The Commission assesses whether the RRP contains an explanation of the Member State’s plans, systems and concrete measures to prevent, detect and correct conflicts of interest, corruption and fraud, and to avoid double funding from the Facility and other Union programmes.

 Technical Support Instrument
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Technical Support Instrument (TSI) as a continuation of the Structural Reform Support Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2017/825.
The TSI is designed to assist national authorities in their endeavours to design, develop and implement reforms.
The TSI is a key tool to support the implementation of reforms by the EU countries in the context of the European Green Deal, the digital transition and the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights.
KEY POINTS
WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DOES THE TSI PROVIDE?
The TSI provides technical support to EU countries in a broad range of policy domains, which include areas related to public financial and asset management, institutional and administrative reform, judicial reform, business environment, the financial sector and improvement of financial literacy, markets for products, services and labour, education and training, gender equality, sustainable development, public health, social welfare and care, as well as early detection and coordinated response capabilities. Specific emphasis is placed on actions that foster the green and digital transitions.
The TSI also supports the preparation for membership of the euro area.
WHEN DOES THE TSI START?
The TSI runs from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027. It has a budget of €864 million for the 7 years it is in force.
WHAT TYPE OF SUPPORT DOES THE TSI PROVIDE?
The TSI provides technical support to EU countries in a broad range of policy domains, which include areas related to public financial and asset management, institutional and administrative reform, judicial reform, business environment, the financial sector and improvement of financial literacy, markets for products, services and labour, education and training, gender equality, sustainable development, public health, social welfare and care, as well as early detection and coordinated response capabilities. Specific emphasis is placed on actions that foster the green and digital transitions.
The TSI also supports the preparation for membership of the euro area.
HOW DOES THE TSI WORK?
EU countries wishing to receive technical support under the TSI submit a request for technical support to the European Commission, identifying the policy areas and the priorities for support within the scope of the TSI.
The Commission analyses the request for support based on the urgency, breadth and depth of the challenges identified, support needs in respect of the policy areas concerned, analysis of socioeconomic indicators and institutional and general administrative capacity of the EU countries concerned.
Based on that analysis and taking into account the existing actions and measures financed by Union funds or other Union programmes, the Commission and the EU countries concerned agree on the priority areas for support, the objectives, an indicative timeline, the scope of the support measures to be provided and the estimated global financial contribution for such technical support, which is set out in a cooperation and support plan.
The cooperation and support plan identifies, separately from other technical support, the measures linked to the recovery and resilience plans pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/241.
The cooperation and support plan is published on the Commission’s website.
The Commission provides technical support to EU countries upon request, in order to support the implementation of reforms undertaken at the initiative of EU countries, reforms in the context of economic governance processes, in particular those effectively addressing the country-specific recommendations or actions related to the implementation of Union law, and reforms in relation to the implementation of economic adjustment programmes.
The Commission establishes a work programme for the implementation of technical support. It may grant technical support in the form of grants, procurement, prizes and indirect implementation.
The Commission provides an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Regulation.
