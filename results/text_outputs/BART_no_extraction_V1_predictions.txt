EU Space Programme and European Union Agency for the Space Programme (ESA)
EU Space Programmes and ESA
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/696 establishing the EU Space Programme
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the EU’s space programme and ESA, the European Union agency for the space programme.
It aims to encourage scientific and technological progress in the space sector and to support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the EU, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), start-ups and innovative businesses.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU countries and the European Economic Area (EEA) Member States. It does not apply to:
the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and then Galileo and Copernicus;
European Space Agency (ESA);
EU countries’ access to the European launch facilities;
the EU Agency for Space Technology (ESA).
Objectives
The purpose of the regulation is to ensure the continuity of EU space initiatives and programmes and the services they provide. It also aims to promote the use and uptake of the data, information and services provided, as well as the development of downstream applications based on those data and services.
To achieve these objectives, ESA is responsible for:
ensuring that the EU benefits from an autonomous access to and efficient use of launch facilities and launch services;
providing the EU-wide public access to launch facilities, including the use of the European space infrastructure;
promoting the development and use of space data and information systems;
supporting the dissemination of information campaigns regarding the benefits of the programme;
developing and promoting space applications;
exercising synergies between the transport, space and digital sectors in order to foster the broader use of new technologies, such as e-call, digital tachograph, traffic supervision and management, autonomous driving and unmanned vehicles and drones, and to respond to the need of secure and seamless connectivity, robust positioning, intermodality and interoperability.
The ESA is governed by Article 189(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) which allows the EU to be a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the field of space.
Evaluation of ESA
ESA has been developing its own space initiatives since the end of the 1990s, namely the European geostatary navigation overlay service, then the European satellite navigation system, Galileo, and the EU space programme, which respond to both the needs of EU citizens and the requirements of public policies. It is therefore essential to ensure that ESA is able to rapidly adapt to the technological developments in the sector and that it remains competitive in the market.
EU Member States must ensure that:
ESA is autonomous in terms of access to its own launch facilities (e.g. the European Space Agency);
ESA operates in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 189 of the TEU;
ESA and the Member States have the right to request the European Commission and the entities responsible for the programme to establish a European launch facility for the purpose of providing the EU with access to space launch facilities.
In addition, ESA and ESA are responsible for providing the European public with information on the programme, including:
information on the EU programme and the ESA;
information campaigns on the benefits and future prospects of the ESA and the Union Space Programme;
data and information services provided by ESA, ESA, EU countries, the Commission and ESA.

European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe) — rules for the reporting of maritime transport information (European Union rules on the transmission of information between EU countries and the EU countries’ authorities and port service providers)
European Maritime single window environment (EMSWE) rules for reporting of marine transport information
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1239 establishing a European Maritime Single-Window environment and repealing Directive 2010/65/EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European maritime single-window (EMSWE) environment.
It aims to simplify and harmonise the reporting procedures for maritime transport operators* and to improve the functioning of the EU’s internal market and to meet the needs of citizens and businesses.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must accept the fulfilment of the reporting obligations of ships arriving in and departing from EU ports in electronic format and to ensure their transmission via a single window in order to facilitate and expedite maritime transport.
The regulation sets out rules for:
the use in every maritime National Single Window of common interface software for system-to-system exchanges of information, developed at EU level;
the harmonisation of the front-end interfaces of those national single-windows on the side of the declarants;
common interfaces of the national national single windows for data transmission between the national authorities and the providers of port services.
National authorities must:
ensure that the same data sets can be reported to each maritime national single window;
provide the same information for other transport modes;
make it available to other EU countries to the same way;
establish a common interface for the use of the maritime single window for the transmission and storage of similar information;
apply the rules laid down in the regulation to all EU countries.
In addition, EU countries must also:
make available to the European Commission and the European Maritime Information System Agency (EMSSA) the software for the electronic transmission of maritime data;
develop and maintain the interface module for each national single Window;
implement the rules for data storage and processing of information in accordance with the requirements laid down by the regulation.
EU states may not impose disproportionate administrative burdens on shipping companies, as they do not impose a disproportionate administrative burden on them.
Implementation of the regulation
The EU countries are responsible for integrating and managing the EMSWE interface module and for updating the software regularly and in a timely manner when new versions are provided by the Commission. The Commission must develop this module and provide updates when needed, since the development of digital technologies is moving fast and any technological solution could rapidly become outdated in the light of new developments.
Exemption from the obligation to develop and operate a manual interface for maritime data transmission:
national authorities and service providers are exempted from this obligation;
declarants do not have to develop, operate or operate a graphical user interface for electronic data transmission;
national service providers, such as Port Community Systems, are not required to provide the user with a graphical interface for their electronic data transmissions.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 25 July 2019. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 25 July 2021.
BACKGROUND

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out EU rules on the labelling of energy-related products.
It aims to improve the efficiency of these products and to encourage innovation and investment in energy efficiency.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all products placed on the EU market for the first time, including second-hand imported products, including products that are made available for a second or additional time. It does not apply to energy consumption of means of transport for persons or goods that are directly and indirectly regulated by other EU law and policies.
EU Member States must ensure that:
the energy consumption information on the energy label is accurate and comparable to that on the label of a comparable energy system;
the information on energy efficiency of the energy system is comparable to the information on comparable energy systems in other Member States.
The energy label must contain the following information:
a description of the product’s energy consumption and its energy efficiency;
an energy efficiency rating;
a list of energy efficiency values;
energy efficiency values.
Member States must:
ensure that the energy consumption values are comparable to those set out in the European Energy Information System (EISA);
make the information available to the public available on the European Commission's website;
European Energy Information Agency (EIA);
provide information to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions;
make sure that the information provided by the Member States is accurate, comparable and up-to-date.
National authorities must take the necessary measures to ensure that the legislation does not lead to divergent transposition by Member States and thus ensures a higher degree of harmonisation across the EU.
Exemptions from the scope of the regulation include:
products that are being sold for a limited period of time;
products which are not being sold to the general public;
electrical equipment that is not being used for the purpose of heating, cooling or air-conditioning;
motorised equipment that does not stay in the same location during operation.
Importers must ensure the following:
that the energy efficiency ratings and energy efficiency value of the products are comparable;
that they are available to consumers and that they are not misleading;
they provide the information that consumers need to make informed choices based on the information they have received on energy consumption.
In addition, Member States are required to:
take the necessary steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the information contained in the regulation;
establish a system of national authorities responsible for monitoring the compliance with the regulation and for the enforcement of the legislation;
apply the legislation in line with the principles of EU energy law.

Protection against dumped imports from non-EU countries
Protection of imports from countries not members of the European Union
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 on protection against dumping imports from outside the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, which had been substantially amended several times.
It aims to ensure that the EU’s anti-dumping rules are applied in line with Article VI of the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
all non-market-economy imports* into the EU from countries other than those covered by the 1994 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
It does not apply to imports originating in the EU and originating in non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries.
Importers must notify the European Commission of any imports they consider to be dumped.
The Commission must inform the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of the reasons for initiating and pursuing an investigation and the results of the investigation, including the establishment and treatment of the facts, the imposition of provisional measures and the imposition and collection of antidumping duties, the duration and review of the measures, and the public disclosure of information relating to the investigation.
Procedures
If an investigation is launched, the Commission must:
inform the EU countries and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) of its decision to launch an investigation;
the EU countries of any measures to be taken.
If the Commission concludes that an investigation has been launched, it must inform all EU countries, the EFTA and the other EU countries concerned.
EU countries must inform each other of the decision to initiate an investigation. The Commission must also inform the other countries of the reason for initiating the investigation and of the results thereof.
Duties
The European Commission may impose duties on imports of goods from the non-EEA if it considers that they are likely to cause material injury to the EU industry. The duties may also be imposed on imports originating from the EU or originating in an EU country.
Expiry
If a country considers that an import is likely to result in material injury or injury to its industry, it may submit a request to the Commission for an investigation to determine whether it is dumping. If the Commission considers that the import is not dumping, it can impose duties and/or a suspension of imports.
Where an investigation concludes that the imports are dumping, the EU country must impose duties or suspend imports for a period of 6 months. The period of suspension may be extended for a further 6 months if the Commission determines that the duties or suspension are not justified by the facts of the case.
In the event of a suspension or a reduction in imports, EU countries may impose additional duties or a suspension on the import of goods originating in another EU country or originating from an EFTA country. They may also impose additional tariffs or suspension measures on the imports originating or originating within the EU.

Protection against subsidised imports from non-EU countries (subsidies and countervailing measures)
Protection of EU consumers from imports of agricultural products from outside the EU (Subsidies & Countervailing Measures)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 on protection against subsidising imports from countries not members of the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, which had been substantially amended in 2009.
It aims to ensure that EU consumers benefit from the protection provided for in the Subsidies Agreement (see summary).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
subsidised imports* of agricultural and non-food products originating in the EU from countries other than the EU;
countervailable imports* originating in EU countries.
Who may lodge a countervailable complaint against these imports?
The European Commission may:
make a complaint on behalf of producers in a region of the EU, including the extent to which it should be supported by the EU industry;
make an application to the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) for a European Anti-Fraud Office (Annex 1A to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The Commission may also:
impose duties on imports originating in a country not covered by the agreement;
take measures to prevent or restrict imports originating from the EU of goods originating in that country;
from a country that has not been party to the agreement.
Applicants may also lodge a complaint against imports originating within the EU and originating in an EU country.
EU countries must:
ensure that EU citizens have the right to be informed of any measures taken by the Commission to prevent, restrict or restrict the import of goods from the country concerned;
provide the Commission with all the information it needs to make a decision on the application of the regulation;
notify the European Parliament and the Council of the measures they intend to take.
The EU countries must inform the Commission of all the measures that they have taken in response to a complaint, including:
the amount of the subsidy;
the nature and duration of the duties imposed on the imports;
any other information that may be necessary to determine whether the imports have caused material injury or are threatening to cause injury.
If the Commission considers that the imports are likely to cause material injury, it may impose duties on them. The Commission must inform EU countries of the reasons for this decision.
Duties may be imposed under certain conditions:
in the case of EU countries, the duties must be imposed in accordance with the general principles of the WTO Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994;
in cases where a market benchmark does not exist or is unreliable, the benchmark must be determined by adjusting the terms and conditions prevailing in the countries concerned on the basis of actual factors available in those countries. If this is not practicable because, inter alia, such prices or costs exist or are unreliable, then the appropriate benchmark is determined by resorting to terms or conditions in other markets.
In cases where the EU country concerned determines that a subsidy does not constitute a material injury and that a benefit is not likely to be conferred on the recipient enterprise, the Commission may impose a duty. The duties may be:
suspended for a period of 5 years;
restrictions imposed on imports of certain goods;
suspension of imports of some goods from certain EU countries;
provisional imposition of duties on certain goods imported from certain countries; and
restriction of certain imports of goods imported in certain cases.
Where a duty is imposed on an import from a country which is not a party to an agreement on subvention, it must be notified to the Commission.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?
 
   
It has applied since 30 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
  * KEY TERMS
* Subsidy: any form of income or price support provided by a government or a public body within the territory of a country to a recipient enterprise.
* Countervailable import: any type of subsidy that is counter-vailable under the WTO agreement on trade in goods and services.

Rail passengers’ rights and obligations: Regulation (EU) 2021/782 (recast)
Rail passengers' rights and obligation: Regulation(EU) 2020/852
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU)* 2021/783 on rail passenger rights
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of rail passenger services in order to increase the share of rail transport in relation to other modes of transport.
It repeals and repeals Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007.
KEY POINTS
Railpassengers are the weaker party to the transport contract and therefore are entitled to a higher level of consumer protection in the European Union (EU).
EU countries may grant exemptions from certain rules relating to non-discriminatory conditions of transport contracts, to the right to purchase rail tickets without undue difficulty, to railway undertakings’ liability in respect of passengers and their luggage, and to the requirement that railway companies provide adequate security in railway stations and on trains.
Exemption from certain obligations as regards the provision of through-ickets and re-routing
The regulation allows EU countries to grant exemptions to certain services that facilitate the use of rail services by persons with disabilities or persons with reduced mobility, as well as to rail services offered strictly for historic or touristic use. However, EU countries must ensure that these exemptions do not apply to essential rules, in particular not to those provisions relating to:
the right of the rail passenger to purchase a rail ticket;
the obligation of the railway company to ensure that passengers are adequately insured;
their luggage is adequately insured.
exemption from the obligation to provide through-tickets and to re-route passenger journeys
exemptions from the requirement to provide a through-ticket and to ensure a re-ticket in the event of a significant change in the route of a rail service.
The European Commission has adopted a number of amendments to the regulation. These amendments aim to improve consumer protection and to encourage an increase in rail travel, whilst having due regard in particular to Articles 11, 12 and 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). In view of those amendments and in the interests of clarity, the regulation has been recast.
Amendments to the Regulation
The Regulation repeals, repeals or clarifies certain provisions of the previous regulation. It also repeals:
Article 91(1) of the TFEU on the rights of rail passengers;
Article 13(2) of Article 91(3) of Regulation (European Parliament and of the Council on the carriage of goods by rail (see summary);
Article 11(4) of Articles 11(5) and 11(6) of Council Regulation on the transport of passengers (See summary).

Summary 30:
Protecting persons who report breaches of EU law
Protecting individuals who report violations of EU laws
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who disclose breaches of Union law
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to enhance the enforcement of public procurement rules and to ensure that whistleblowers are protected effectively against retaliation.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to acts and policy areas where there is a need to strengthen enforcement, under-reporting by whistleblowers is a key factor affecting enforcement, and breaches of European Union law can cause serious harm to the public interest.
EU countries must introduce effective, confidential and secure reporting channels for whistleblowers. These channels should be open to all persons who work for a public or private organisation or who are in contact with such an organisation in the context of their work-related activities. They should be able to disclose breaches, and should be protected against any form of retaliation. In addition, EU countries must ensure that the confidentiality of these channels is respected and that the information they provide is kept confidential.
Whistleblowers are entitled to:
the protection of their identity and anonymity;
the right to confidentiality and confidentiality of their information;
protection against any type of retaliation;
access to the confidentiality and secrecy of the information that they provide;
exclusion from the confidentiality or confidentiality of the confidential and confidentiality channels.
Exemptions from confidentiality
The legislation applies to the following areas:
contracting authorities and contracting entities in relation to the execution of works, the supply of products or the provision of services, as well as financial institutions;
financial institutions and investment firms;
investment firms and investment banks;
other entities in the financial services sector;
public procurement.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
From 26 November 2019. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 26 December 2019.
BACKGROUND
   
EU law on public procurement is fragmented across EU countries and uneven across policy areas. The consequences of breaches of the law with a cross-border dimension reported by whistleblowers illustrate how insufficient protection in one Member State negatively impacts the functioning of EU policies not only in that Member State, but also in other Member States and in the Union as a whole. In this context, the importance of providing balanced and effective whistleblower protection is increasingly acknowledged at both EU and international level.

‘Protecting whistleblowers’ on the European Commission’s website.

Recovery and resolution of central counterparties: EU framework for the recovery and recovery of counterparties (Regulation (EU) 2021/23) (European Commission)
Recovery, resolution and recovery procedures for central counterpartying (Regulations (EU, Euratom)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation(EU) 2020/23 on a framework for recovery and resolution (CCPs)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a framework to recover and resolve the insolvency of central counterparty (CCP) counterparties* in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
CCPs authorised in the EU;
the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB);

It applies to all CCPs authorised to clear financial and commodity derivatives, including listed and over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivatives, cash equities, bonds and other products such as repos. It does not apply to clearing of credit default swap (CDS) derivatives.
Rules for the resolution of CCPs
The resolution of a CCP’s insolvent counterparties is governed by the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 648/2012 on the prudential, organisational and conduct of the CCPs. These rules aim to ensure that when a CCP is in financial distress or is at the point of failure, it does not de-stabilise the entire EU financial market and damage growth across the wider economy. The resolution procedures are based on the following principles:
the CCP must honour its obligations created by the transactions;
it must provide adequate collateral from its members as margin and as contributions to default funds.
If a CCP fails to provide sufficient collateral, it may be subject to special proceedings for the purpose of preventing the disruption of the financial stability of the EU economy. However, the resolution procedures must not jeopardise the continuity of the economy.
The European Commission is responsible for:
monitoring the resolution procedure;
ensuring that CCPs comply with the requirements of the regulation;
assisting the ECB and the national authorities in the resolution process;
providing the ECB with the information it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the European financial system;
coordinating with the other EU countries and the EBA;
advising the ECB, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSA) and national authorities on the application of the rules.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?
   
 
It has applied since 1 January 2021. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 2023.
BACKGROUND
EU financial markets are pivotal for the functioning of modern economies. The more integrated they are, the greater the potential for efficient allocation of economic resources will be, potentially benefitting economic performance.

European Year of Rail (2021)
European year of Rail
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2020/2228 on a European Year of rail
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It establishes a European year of rail to mark the European Union’s commitment to becoming a climate-neutral Union by 2050.
It aims to promote sustainable and smart mobility in order to tackle climate change.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The decision applies to the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023. It does not apply to:
the EU countries’ national rail administrations;
the European Union Agency for Railways and the European Network of European Railways (ENERGY);
the Member States’ authorities responsible for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and for the management of the rail freight corridors.
Objectives
The aim of the decision is to encourage the use of rail for the transport of people, goods and capital in the EU. It also aims to improve the efficiency of the EU rail freight network and to promote the development of sustainable intermodal transport.
The objective of the European year is to promote a European railway area, which aims to create a single European rail area. The aim of this is to ensure that the rail sector has a dominant role in the European economy and that it is not only the main means of transport, but also the main mode of transport for the EU citizens and the economy as a whole of Europe.
In order to achieve this objective, the decision calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures:
to:
ensure that rail services are more affordable, accessible, cleaner and more energy-efficient;
encourage people to use sustainable transport modes, such as walking, cycling and public transport;
improve the quality and safety of rail services;
increase the frequency of passenger and freight services, particularly in rural areas and in remote regions;
strengthen rail safety and security;
promote the integration of rail into the economic and social cohesion of the whole of the Union;
make rail services more affordable and accessible to the general public;
facilitate access to rail services for the general population and to the rural areas;
provide the public with better information on rail services, including the availability of information on timetables, timetables and timetables;
develop and improve the capacity of the national rail networks;
implement measures to ensure the safety of passengers, freight and passengers;
support the development and maintenance of the trans-European transport network, including by:
improving the quality of the infrastructure;
ensuring the safety and reliability of the railway network;
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the freight and passenger services, in particular by improving the safety, security and security of the passenger services; and
promoting the development, maintenance and operation of rail infrastructure.
Implementing measures
The European Commission is responsible for implementing the decision. It must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council every 2 years on its implementation. The report must include a description of the measures taken to achieve the objectives set out in the communication on the European Green Deal. The Commission must also present a report on the progress made by Member States in implementing this decision.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The regulation applies from 21 January 2021. Member States must incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2021.
BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 crisis has hit the transport sector exceptionally hard. Despite operational and financial constraints, the sector has maintained crucial connections both for the transportation of people and of essential goods. This has been possible mainly thanks to the employees who have continued working under difficult and uncertain conditions.

Summary 40:
Minimum requirements for water reuse in the European Union (EU) (Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for Water Reuse
Maximum requirements for the reuse of treated waste water
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2000/60/EC — minimum requirements on water reuse
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out minimum requirements to be met by EU countries to ensure that treated wastewater* is reused whenever it is appropriate and cost-efficient.
It aims to facilitate the uptake of water reuse whenever appropriate.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to wastewater treated in urban wastewater treatment plants. It does not apply to wastewater discharged into surface water bodies or groundwater bodies.
EU countries may decide to extend the scope of the regulation to groundwater bodies and to other water bodies, subject to certain conditions.
The water resources of the EU are increasingly coming under pressure, leading to water scarcity and a deterioration in water quality. In particular, climate change, unpredictable weather patterns and drought are contributing significantly to the strain on the availability of freshwater, arising from urban development and agriculture. Water reuse is a promising option for many EU countries, but many of them do not have the resources to do so. This regulation sets out the minimum requirements that EU countries must apply to water reuse.
Requirements for EU countries
The legislation applies to:
water treatment plants and treatment plants;
water bodies and groundwater bodies;
treated waste water discharged into water bodies; and
water-saving irrigation techniques.
In addition to the regulation’s annexes, EU countries may adopt supplementary measures.
 such as the use of water-efficient technologies in industry and water-saving technologies in agriculture.
the reuse of wastewater in urban water treatment plants, water-efficiency measures in agriculture and water efficiency measures in industry.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLACE INTO FORCE?
 
   
It applies from 1 July 2020. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2023.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a series of actions to promote water reuse, including:
a communication of 2 December 2015 on ‘Closing the loop – an EU action plan for the circular economy’;
the communication of 14 November 2012 on the ‘A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources’.

Summary 51:
Combating money laundering by criminal law
Combating the money laundering problem
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2018/1673 on combating money laundering
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to combat money laundering and the related financing of terrorism and organised crime by means of criminal law.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must ensure that all offences that are punishable by a term of imprisonment as set out in this directive are considered predicate offences for money laundering. Moreover, to the extent that the application of those penalty thresholds does not already do so, EU countries should include a range of offences within each of the categories of offences listed in this Directive.
Where a category of offences, such as terrorism or environmental offences, includes legal acts of the EU, this directive should refer to those legal acts. Any kind of punishable involvement in the commission of a predicate offence as criminalised in accordance with national law should also be considered as a criminal activity for the purposes of this directive.
In cases where EU law allows EU countries to provide for sanctions other than criminal sanctions, this Directive should not require EU States to classify the offences in those cases as predicate offences. In that case, Member States should decide how to delimit the range of offence within each category.
Taxation and tax-related offences
In addition to tax offences, the directive applies to indirect tax crimes. These include:
the transfer of funds between accounts;
the exchange of information on tax payments;
any other form of tax evasion.
The directive also applies to:
money laundering offences committed by public office holders in line with their national legal traditions;
tax-related tax crimes committed by tax authorities;
non-tax related tax offences.
Member States should ensure that:
all tax offences are covered by this directive, including:
tax evasion;
falsification of tax information;
transfers of funds;
exchange of information between tax authorities.
Exceptions
The Directive does not apply to certain types of tax offences such as tax evasion, tax fraud, tax avoidance, tax evasion and tax evasion in relation to the proceeds of crime.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
The legislation entered into force on 1 January 2019.

Protecting the EU industry against injurious pricing of vessels
Protecting The EU Industry Against Injurious Pricing of Vessels
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 on protection against the sale of ships below their normal value
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules on the calculation of the ‘normal value’* of a vessel.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 385/96.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to any vessel sold below its normal value. It does not apply to:
the sale of a ship to a non-EU country for use in international trade;
the export of a similar vessel to an EU country;
ship-purchase transactions.
The normal value is calculated on the basis of a representative sale of the same vessel in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country.
EU countries must inform the European Commission of the normal value of the vessel when it is sold to an importer or to a buyer outside the EU. The normal value must not be lower than the value calculated in accordance with the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement (see summary).
The Commission must take all necessary steps to ascertain the validity of the accounting structure of the seller’s accounts and the accounting rules of the buyer.
If a vessel is sold at a price below the normal price, it must be investigated by the Commission. The Commission may also take action against the seller if it considers that the sale is likely to cause injury to the Union industry.
 or that the vessel is not to be at a loss.
In the event of a sale at a lower normal value, the EU country must notify the other EU countries of its intention to take action. The EU countries must also inform the Commission of their intention to do so.
Expiry procedure
A vessel may be subject to an investigation by the EU only when the buyer is a Union buyer, and provided the ship is not a military vessel. It is expedient to define the circumstances in which a domestic sale may be considered to be made at loss and may be disregarded, and in which recourse may be had to sale of such a vessel to a third country, or to another EU country, at a higher price.
Importers and importers must ensure that:
a ship is sold for a price that is not below the market price of the country in which it is registered;
it is not sold for less than the normal market price;
a vessel has been repaired or rebuilt for a higher market price than its normal market value;
there is no difference between the price paid for the repair or reconstruction of the ship and the price at which the vessel was sold.
Shipowners must be informed of the procedure to be followed in the case of any sale of vessels at a below-normal market price. They must also provide the Commission with a list of the vessels for which they are liable to be held liable for any damage caused by the sale at less than their normal price. In addition, the Commission must inform them of the measures to be taken in the event that they consider that a vessel has not been sold at the price set out in the regulation.
Where a vessel appears to have been sold for sale below its market price, the vessel must be inspected and, where appropriate, the owner must be notified of the reasons for its sale. The vessel must also be examined in the light of the information provided in the annex to the regulation and any other relevant information provided by the shipowner or importer.
Annex III to the 1994 anti-dumping agreement contains the basic principles of the Shipbuilding Agreement and the IPI Code. It sets out the procedure for the enforcement of the EU anti-injurious pricing rules.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULAR REGULATIONS APPLY?
   
 
Regulations (EU, EU) 2017/1036 and (EU), 2017/1139 have applied since 1 July 2017.
Regulated (EU).
BACKGROUND
The European Union has adopted a number of measures to protect the industry against the threat of anti-competitive conditions in the commercial shipbuilding and repair industry. These include:
measures to prevent and combat the abuse of subsidies and countervailing measures;
measures for the protection of the interests of shipowners and operators.
For more information, see:

* KEY TERMS
* Importers: any person, company or organisation that has a dominant position in the market for the sale or repair of vessels.

System of own resources of the European Union (SUEU)
System of its own resources
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 on the system of EU own resources and repealing Decision 2014/335/EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It sets out the EU’s own resources (i.e. the revenue that EU countries contribute to the EU budget) for the period 2021-2027.
It aims to better align these with EU policy priorities, to better reflect the role of the general budget of the EU (‘the Union budget’) in the functioning of the single market, to support the objectives of EU policies and to reduce Member States’ contributions based on gross national income (GNI).
KEY POINTS
The decision sets out:
a new category of own resource based on national contributions calculated on the quantity of non-recycled plastic packaging waste that is not recycled in each EU country;
a mechanism to adjust the contributions of Member States with a GNI per capita below the EU average.
The new own resource will be calculated on a weighted average of the national contributions of the Member States concerned. It will be based on:
the quantity of plastic packaging that does not recycle in each Member State, multiplied by the population of that Member State;
the percentage of the total volume of plastic waste not recycled.
Member States will be free to take the most suitable measures to achieve those goals, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
An adjustment mechanism with an annual lump sum reduction will be applied to contributions of EU countries with a GDP per capita in 2017 below the European average. The reduction will correspond to 3,8 kilograms multiplied by 3.8 kilograms. Member States will not be able to reduce their contributions more than 5 % of the GNI of their Member States. The adjustment mechanism will be in place for a period of 5 years. The Commission will put forward proposals for additional own resources in the light of the developments in the field of climate change.
In addition, the European Commission will submit a proposal to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of this decision.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
Council Decision (EU) 2020 /2053 has applied since 15 December 2020.
Amending Decision (Euratom) 2021/2027 has applied from 1 January 2021.
BACKGROUND
The EU budget is the main source of revenue for the EU. However, it is subject to strict budgetary discipline. To ensure adequate resources for the development of the policies of the Union, the EU must ensure that its policies are compatible with its policy priorities. This is why the European Council of 17 to 21 July 2020 concluded that over the coming years the Union would work towards reforming the system in order to introduce new own resources.

Summary 71:
Labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters (Regulation (EU) 2020/740 - fuel efficiency, safety and noise)
Labelling and safety of tyres
Labeling and safety information on tyres
SUMMARY OF:
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It aims to encourage end-users to purchase more fuel-efficient tyres by providing them with harmonised information on the rolling resistance* and noise* parameters of tyres.
It repeals Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
new tyres;
new types of tyres (C1 tyres, C2 tyres and C3 tyres);
new type of tyres designed specifically for the European Union (EU).
Tyres are characterised by a number of interrelated parameters. Improving one parameter, such as rolling resistance, may have an adverse impact on other parameters such as wet grip, while improving wet grip performance may have a negative impact on external rolling noise. To reduce the environmental impact of road transport, it is therefore appropriate to update the rules on tyre labelling to provide consumers with more relevant and comparable information on these parameters.
The European Commission has adopted a proposal to encourage tyre manufacturers to optimise all parameters beyond the current standards.

It aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to no net emissions of GHG by 2050.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all EU countries and the European Commission.
EU countries must:
ensure that GHG emissions are reduced to zero by 2050, i.e. no net GHG emission in the EU by 2050;
take the necessary measures to prevent GHG from being released into the atmosphere and to minimise the impact of climate change on human health, the environment and the economy;
implement the EU climate action plan for 2020-2030 (see summary), which sets out a number of measures to tackle climate change, including:
the EU climate and health observatory;
the European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT;
measures to adapt the EU to climate change and to the impacts of extreme weather events;
environmental measures to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital;
actions to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts.
In addition, EU countries are required to:
take action to reduce GHG greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum by 2020;
by 2020, the EU countries must have reduced GHGigaton emissions by at least 60 % from 1990 levels;
at least 80 % by 2030
by 2050, at least 80% by 80%;

By 2035, by 40 % for the energy sector
by 60 % for agriculture
by 50% for forestry
by 70% for fisheries
by 75% for agriculture and forestry
By 2050, by 60 % in all other fields
by 90 % for transport
by 100 % for energy
by 85% for other sectors.
By 2030, the regulation also requires EU countries to take the necessary steps to ensure that:
GHG emissions by 2050 are no more than 0.5 % of the total GHG emitted by the EU in 2050
by the end of the 2030s.
The European Commission has adopted a climate action strategy for the EU, which aims to transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, where there are no net CO2 emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The strategy is based on the EU Green Deal, which is part of the EU strategy on climate change. The European Green Deal also aims to protect and conserve the Union's natural assets, including its biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to protect citizens from environmental-related threats and impacts, including the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.

Better Law - Making: InterInstitutional Agreement among the European Union institutions
SUMMARY OF:
INTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL OF THE EU AND THE European Commission on better law-making
Decision (EU) 2017/852 on the conclusion, on behalf of the EU, of the Interinstitutional Agreement between EU institutions on Better Law-making (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, pp. 1-8)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREATION AND THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to simplify EU legislation and reduce the regulatory burden for citizens, administrations and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of the Union economy.
The decision marks the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement.
KEY POINTS
The three institutions recognise their joint responsibility in delivering high-quality Union legislation and in ensuring that such legislation focuses on areas where it has the greatest added value for European citizens, is as simple and as clear as possible, avoids overregulation and administrative burdens for citizens and administrations, especially SMEs, and is transposition and practical application.
In order to achieve this objective, the three institutions agree to pursue the aim of simplifying EU legislation, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality. They also agree to promote transparency in the legislative process and to ensure that EU legislation is comprehensible and comprehensible for the public and the public administrations.
EU legislation must be drafted in a way that is consistent with the EU’s general principles of transparency and fairness. It must be written in a language that is easily understood by the public, the public authorities and the EU institutions. The European Commission must gather all necessary expertise prior to adopting delegated acts. The Commission must also ensure that the analysis of the potential ‘European added value’ of any proposed EU action, as well as an assessment of the ‘cost of non-Europe’ in the absence of action at EU level, is fully taken into account when setting the legislative agenda.
National parliaments are responsible for the drafting of EU legislation. In this context, they recall the equality of both co-legislators as enshrined in the Treaties.
Public and stakeholder consultation, ex-post evaluation of existing legislation and impact assessments of new initiatives will help achieve the objective of better law making.
Implementation of the agreement
The 3 institutions undertake to cooperate in order to promote the objectives of the better-law-making agreement. They agree to:
ensure that the legislation is written in such a way as to be comprehensible to the public;
promote transparency and the rule of law in the EU legislative process;
encourage the use of the recasting technique for legal acts;
allow the public to participate in the decision-making process.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through EU acts
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a legal framework for the use of the internal market information system, IMI, to facilitate administrative cooperation between EU countries and between the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council.
It repeals Decision 2008/49/EC.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU acts governing the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital in the EU. It does not apply to:
the Schengen acquis;
the European Pillar of Social Rights (see summary);
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU); or
the Single Market Act.
Implementation
Implementing the regulation requires EU countries to exchange information with one another and with the Commission on the application of the EU acts listed in the annex to the regulation.
EU countries must ensure that the information exchanged in IMI complies with the security and confidentiality requirements laid down in Article 8 and 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union.
The information exchanged must be collected, processed and used for purposes in line with those for which it was originally collected and subject to all relevant safeguards.
IMI is a software application accessible via the internet, developed by the Commission in cooperation with the EU countries. It is used primarily for the exchange of information, including personal data, which would otherwise take place via other means, including regular mail, fax or electronic mail, on the basis of a legal obligation imposed on EU countries’ authorities and bodies in EU acts.
In order to overcome language barriers, the Commission must provide IMI users with any existing additional translation functionality that meets their needs, is compatible with the confidentiality and security requirements and can be offered at a reasonable cost.

The European Commission must:
ensure that personal data are only exchanged for the purposes for which they were originally collected;
not for any other purpose other than the purpose for which the personal data were collected and processed;
provide IMI operators with the information they need for the processing of EU acts;
make IMI available in all official EU languages, including those of the Member States and the Commission.
Where an EU act requires the Member State to exchange personal data for processing purposes, it must provide the Commission with the necessary information for this purpose. The Commission must also provide the user with the additional information it needs for IMI to be able to use the information it receives.
Access to IMI data
The Member States must allow the Commission to access IMI personal data only if it is necessary for the proper processing of a Union act. This information must be provided in a form that is easily understood and understandable by the user.
Member States must inform the Commission of any data protection restrictions imposed on IMI or on other means of communication, such as electronic mail or fax.
If the Commission considers that a Member State has not complied with the requirements of the regulation, it may suspend or restrict the access of IMI user data for a period of time.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?

Rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (EASA)
Rules for:
EU border surveillance operations at the sea border of other Member States or on the high seas
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 656/2014 — rules for border surveillance at the European sea borders
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules for EU-wide border surveillance* at the external borders of the EU.
It aims to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders including through border surveillance, while contributing to ensuring the protection and saving of lives.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
border surveillance operations carried out by EU countries at their external sea border;
operational cooperation with non-EU countries, including the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Europol) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA);
cooperation between EU countries and EMSA.
EU countries and the EMSA must comply with the rules laid down in the regulation.
Operational cooperation
Cooperation with neighbouring countries is crucial to prevent unauthorised border crossings, to counter cross-border criminality and to avoid loss of life at sea. To this end, border surveillance is not limited to the detection of attempts at illegal border crossings but equally extends to steps such as intercepting vessels suspected of trying to gain entry to the EU without submitting to border checks, as well as arrangements to address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during a border surveillance operation at sea and arrangements intended to bring such an operation to a successful conclusion.
The European Maritime, Land and Aerial Surveillance System (EMS) is responsible for the coordination of border surveillance activities at the maritime, land and aerial borders of EU countries. The EMSA is also responsible for assisting EU countries in circumstances requiring increased technical assistance at the EU external borders, taking into account the fact that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies and rescue.
When cooperation with third countries takes place on the territory or the territorial sea of those countries, the parties and the Agency should comply with norms and standards at least equivalent to those set by EU law.
Information exchange
The EMSA and the EU countries must ensure that:
the information exchange of information is based on situational awareness and situational awareness;
the sharing of information improves the information exchange capability between the European border control authorities;
information exchange improves the situational awareness of the information needed to prevent and discourage persons from circumventing the checks at border crossing points.
Cooperating with non–EU countries
The agency may cooperate with the competent authorities of third countries, in particular as regards risk analysis and training, and should facilitate operational cooperation between Member States and third countries.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 27 June 2014. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 27 June 2015.
BACKGROUND
 
  EU border management, asylum and immigration policy is governed by the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the EU Member States pursuant to Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFEU). Wherever necessary, EU acts adopted in the framework of those policies are to contain appropriate measures to give effect to that principle and promote burden-sharing including through the transfer, on a voluntary basis, of beneficiaries of international protection.
For more information, see:
‘Border management’ on the European Commission’s website.
* KEY TERMS
* EU border control: the operation of border controls in the field of immigration and asylum policy.
MAIN DOCUMENT
  The regulation sets out the rules for the border surveillance and maritime surveillance operations conducted by Member States at the border of the other EU countries (e.g. at sea, land or on land) in cooperation with EMSA, the European Customs Union (ECU) and Europol.

Conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing (Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 on certain measures for the purpose of the conservation of fishing stocks in the context of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the UNFSA)
Conservation and management of certain shared, straddling and highly migratory fish stocks (UNFSA).
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the conditions under which a country can be considered to be a non-Sustainable Fishing Country (NSFC) and subject to measures under the UNCLOS Convention.
It also defines the type of measures that may be taken with regard to NSCs.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
non-SFC countries that allow fishing activities that jeopardise the sustainability of the stock of common interest (i.e. fish stocks that are not continuously maintained at or above the levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield) or, if these levels cannot be estimated, when the stocks are continuously maintained within safe biological limits.
The Regulation defines the types of measures which may be adopted against a country allowing NSCS fishing. These include:
restrictions on the importation of fish products caught by vessels conducting fisheries on a common interest stock;
restriction of access to ports for those vessels;
preventing EU fishing vessels or EU fishing equipment from being used for fishing the stock under the control of the NSCF;
prohibition of the use of EU fishing gear;
EU fishing vessels and equipment from using the ports of the country allowing the fishing gear of that country.
EU countries may also impose measures against non-SSFCs that fail to cooperate with other countries and the EU in its management of the common interest.
National authorities may impose sanctions on a country that fails to cooperate in the management of a fishery involving a stock common interest to that country and to the EU. These sanctions may include the suspension of fishing rights, duties and interests of other countries or the EU, and the right to be heard and an opportunity to adopt corrective action.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATIONS APPLACE APPLY?
The regulations apply from 14 November 2012.
BACKGROUND
The UN Convention of the International Union for the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish stocks of 4 August 1995 requires the cooperation of all the countries in whose waters the stock occurs (the coastal States) and those countries whose fleets exploit that stock (the fishing States). This cooperation may be established in the framework of regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs), or, where RFMOs have no competence for the stock in question, by means of ad hoc arrangements among the countries having an interest in the fishery.
For more information, see:
Fishing in the EU (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Non-sFC: fishing activity that jeopardises the sustainable management of stocks.
* Sustainable fishing: fishing that is carried out without due regard to existing fishing patterns or the rights and duties of other EU countries and EU countries’ interests.

Summary 103:
EU generalised tariff preferences for developing countries (GSPs)
EU generalized tariff preferences: developing countries’ rights
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 — applying a scheme of generalised tariffs and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It applies a general tariff preference scheme to developing countries.
It repeals and repeals Council Regulations (EC, EC, EC) No 737/2008 and (EC), which had applied since 1 January 2009.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all developing countries which share a common developing need and are in a similar stage of economic development. It does not apply to countries which have completed their transition into a more developed economy and have not yet diversified their economy.
General arrangement
The general arrangement applies to the following countries:
those countries which are classified by the World Bank as high-income or upper-income countries, i.e. countries which attain higher levels of per capita income levels without the need for a transition to a more diversified economy;
developing countries which do not meet the development needs of the most vulnerable countries and which are not subject to any unjustified trade burdens;
the least-developed countries;
those developing countries subject to a special arrangement.
Special arrangements
The European Commission may adopt a proposal to extend the general arrangement for a period of 10 years from the date of application of the preferences provided for in this regulation, except for the special arrangement for the least developed countries, which will continue to apply without any expiry date. The proposal must comply with World Trade Organisation (WTO) requirements, in particular with the Decision on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries (the ‘Enabling Clause’), adopted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1979, under which WTO Members may accord differential and more favourable treatment.
Diversification of the EU’s external trade market
EU countries must diversify their economy through international trade, which can then be reinvested for the benefit of their own development and, in addition, for the diversification of their economies. The general arrangement provides for preferential access to the EU market for goods originating in the EU.
Vulnerable countries
The scheme applies to those countries which meet the following development needs:
the need to diversify its external trade markets;
to reduce poverty and promote good governance and sustainable development; and
to increase the share of EU exports to these countries in their total trade.
The Commission may, under certain conditions, apply a specific type of preferential tariff arrangement to vulnerable countries. This may be:
for goods originating from the EU;
for products originating from non-EU countries; or
for imports originating from EU countries. The Commission may also apply a general arrangement to certain goods originating outside the EU, such as agricultural products.
Exceptions
Certain countries may be excluded from the scheme if they do not fulfil the following conditions:
they are not a member of the World Trade Organization;
they do not have a high level of economic growth or diversification;
their economic needs are not sufficiently diversified to allow them to benefit from the general tariff preferences.
In addition, certain countries may not be eligible for preferential treatment under the general arrangements provided for under this regulation if they are:
not a Member of the WTO;
non-participating in the GATT;
not meeting the conditions laid down in the annex to the regulation;
have not diversified the EU economy sufficiently;
are subject to the conditions set out in the Annex to the Regulation.
If a country does not fulfil these conditions, it may be subject to an unjustified tariff burden. This tariff burden may be reduced or eliminated if the country meets the requirements laid down by the regulation.
Elimination of the special arrangements
A country which does not meet these conditions may not benefit from a special tariff arrangement under the scheme. However, if it meets the criteria set out by the European Commission, the EU may grant a special preferential arrangement to it under the same conditions as the other countries covered by this regulation. In addition, the Commission may grant special preferences to the countries which fulfil the criteria laid down under the regulation, as well as to the non-member countries which comply with the relevant WTO requirements.
Implementation of the regulation
The EU must submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee every 5 years on the implementation of this regulation and to the Committee of the Regions. The report must include a description of the measures taken by the EU to implement the regulation and the measures that have been taken to ensure the continuation of the scheme for the period 2006 to 2015.

BACKGROUND
The quality and diversity of the EU’s agricultural production is one of its important strengths. This is due to the skills and determination of Union farmers and producers who have kept traditions alive while taking into account the developments of new production methods and material.
However, citizens and consumers increasingly demand quality as well as traditional products. Agricultural product quality policy should therefore provide producers with the right tools to better identify and promote those of their products that have specific characteristics while protecting those producers against unfair practices.
For more information, see:
European Union quality schemes (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Organic products: products that are produced in accordance with the European Organic Farming Directive (see summary).
* Aromatized wines: wines that are aromatised with aromatics and which are intended for use in alcoholic drinks.
* Honey: honey derived from beeswax or honey-derived honey.

BACKGROUND
The financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 exposed important shortcomings in European financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. The crisis exposed shortcomings in the areas of cooperation, coordination, consistent application of EU law and trust between national supervisors.
In November 2008, the Commission mandated a High-Level Group chaired by Jacques de Larosière to make recommendations to strengthen European supervision. The report represented the reforms the experts considered were needed and on which work had to begin immediately. It recommended reforms to the structure and structure of supervision in the Union.

EU countries must ensure that workers wishing to move to another EU country can apply for employment, irrespective of their nationality, and that they are treated equally in terms of:
the conditions of employment;
the eligibility for housing;
living and working conditions;
compensation; and
the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
Employment and employment conditions
Employers must inform workers of the conditions under which they can employ them. They must also inform them of any discrimination they may face in relation to their employment, and of the rights and obligations that apply to them as a result of this discrimination.
The employer must inform the worker of the terms and conditions of his or her employment and of any action that may be taken against him or her in accordance with national law.
Housing and living conditions
Workers must be informed of their housing rights and the conditions of their employment. Employers must provide housing for workers who wish to live in another country.

EU trade mark — uniform protection for goods and services (EU-wide protection)
Union trade mark – uniform protection in all EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 on the European Union trade mark
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a uniform EU-wide system for the protection of trade marks.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 40/94, which created a system of trade mark protection specific to the EU.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to trade marks which are governed by a uniform Union law directly applicable in all the EU countries. It does not apply to:
national trade marks;
trade marks obtained only as an EU trade mark in one or more EU countries;
the rights conferred on proprietors of national trade marks by the laws of the EU country in which the trade mark is registered.
EU trade marks may be registered only as EU trade marks if they are:
obliged to be used as a distinctive trade mark or as a trade mark only in the EU;
conformity with the law of an EU country, i.e. the law applicable in that EU country;
use of a distinctive sign or trade mark which is clearly identifiable as belonging to an EU company;
recognition of the goods or services produced by the EU company.
Registration
The European Commission must submit a proposal to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (EEASC) for the registration of EU trade signs. The proposal must contain the following the following information:
the trade mark’s origin, meaning and purpose;
a description of the products and services it represents;
an indication of the origin, purpose and purpose of the product or service;
information on the rights conferred to the proprietor of a national trade mark.
If the Commission considers that the applicant has not complied with the requirements of the regulation, the applicant may apply for protection at EU level. However, the Commission must inform the applicant of the reasons for this decision. If the applicant does not comply with this decision, the application may be refused.
The applicant must submit an application to the Commission, the EESC and the EASC. The Commission then forwards the application to each EU country. If a country considers that an application is not compatible with its national law, it may refuse to register the application. The applicant must then submit a new application, which must contain all the information necessary for the Commission to determine whether the application is compatible with the national law of the country where the application has been lodged. If it is not, it must be sent to the competent authority of that country.
In the event of a dispute between the Commission and the applicant concerning the validity of the application or the application for protection, the European Court of Auditors may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EC. The Court will decide whether the case should be brought before the Court or not. The case will be heard by the European Trade Marks Committee.

It lays down rules on jurisdiction, recognition and applicable law in the area of insolvent proceedings.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
bankruptcy proceedings;
the winding-up of companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings and actions related to insolvent companies;
recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in such proceedings; and
the law applicable to insolvents’ assets.
Application of the regulation
EU countries must apply the rules laid down in Annex A to the regulation. In respect of the national procedures contained in the annexes, the regulation applies without any further examination by the courts of another EU country as long as the conditions listed in the regulation are met.

The European Commission has adopted a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000. The report concluded that the regulation is functioning well in general but that it would be desirable to improve its application in certain areas. It therefore adopted a proposal for a Regulation to be adopted in order to enhance the effective application of certain of its provisions. The proposal was accepted by the European Parliament and the Council.
Amendments to Regulation (EU countries’ national rules on insolventy proceedings
The Commission adopted a regulation amending the regulation in the light of a proposal from the European Economic and Social Committee of the Regions.

Liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents (Annex II of the Athens Convention on liability) (OJ L 131, 28.5.2009, pp. 24-28)
Liability for carriers of passenger ships in the case of accidents
Lack of liability for carriers by sea
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 392/2009 on the liability of carriers* of passengers* by sea as regards damage caused to passengers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules on liability for damage caused by a passenger ship to passengers travelling by sea.
It aims to ensure a proper level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
passenger ships registered in the European Union (EU) and registered in an EU Member State;
ships registered in a Member State other than the EU;
any vessel registered under the flag of an EU country.
Insurance arrangements
The insurance arrangements required under the regulation must take into account the financial means of the ship-owners and insurance companies. When setting insurance arrangements under this regulation, account should therefore be taken of the different classes of ship and of the seasonal nature of their operations.
The liability of the carrier of passengers is based on:
the carrier’s gross gross tonnage (GGT) and gross cargo weight;
the number of passengers and the number of persons on board.
the gross cargo tonnautical miles (GCT) of the vessel;
number of passengers on board and the gross cargo tonnes (GTCT);
the total number of tonnes of cargo.
In the carrier must make an advance payment to the insurance company in case of death or personal injury to a passenger.
An advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability. The insurance company must make the advance payment if it considers that a passenger is likely to die or be seriously injured. The advance payment must be made at the latest on departure.
If a passenger dies or is seriously injured on board, the carrier is liable for the death or injury. The carrier must also make a claim for the damage caused. Insurance companies must ensure that the insurance policy is affordable for small and medium-sized shipping companies operating national transport services.
Passenger rights
Passengers have the following rights:
an advance payment for the duration of their stay in the Member State in which they are registered;
a right to be informed of the rights conferred on them prior to their journey or, where that is not possible, at the earliest on departure;
an obligation to pay compensation for any damage caused during their stay.
Rights conferred on passengers
The Convention on the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 2002 (the Athens Convention), applies to international transport only. It does not apply to domestic transport.
EU Member States may decide whether to accede to or ratify the 2004 Protocol of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) relating to compensation for terrorism-related damage. However, they may decide to incorporate certain aspects of the Protocol into their national law.
Amendments to the regulation
Amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/852 amends the regulation to take account of the changes introduced by the IMO Guidelines on the implementation of the 2004 Athens Convention relating to the liability for damages caused by passenger ships. The amendments include:
a new definition of ‘passenger ship’ in the annexes to Regulation (EC), as well as the definition of the term ‘carrying passengers’;
new definitions of the terms ‘gross cargo weight’ and ‘total cargo’, as defined in Annexes II and III of the regulation;
more detailed definitions of gross cargo weights (GDT) and total cargo tonnes, as set out in the Annexes IV and V of the Regulation;
changes to the definitions of cargo weights and cargo tonnes;
rules on the types of cargo weighing more than 10 tonnes and the weight of the cargo, as laid down in Annex IV of Regulation (Euratom);
new rules on the type and quantity of cargo to be carried by the carrier and the amount of damage to the passenger ship.
Implementing Regulation (C) 2019/853 amends Regulation (e.g. Annexes V and VI of the Euratom) to the Regulation on the insurance arrangements for passenger ships and to the Insurance Rules for the carriage of passengers.

Summary 143:
European rail network for competitive freight
European rail system for freight
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 concerning a European rail network of international rail freight
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish international rail corridors* for the purpose of improving the conditions of use of the EU’s railway infrastructure.
It harmonises rules relating to those freight corridors.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
international rail freight corridors* which meet specific needs in one or more clearly identified segments of the freight market, i.e. the trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and/or the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) corridors;
the European rail traffic management system (ERTMS)* corridors; and
the interconnections with the rail infrastructure of European non-EU countries.
EU Member States must encourage the establishment of these international freight corridors, as well as projects aimed at encouraging the development of those corridors, within the framework of the Cohesion Fund, research and development programmes and the European Investment Fund for Railways (EIFRD).
The European Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council every 5 years on the implementation of the regulation. The report must include information on the following:
the number of freight trains carried out in the corridor;
traffic volume and the number of passengers carried out on the corridor.
Annex II to the regulation sets out the rights and obligations of the infrastructure managers.
The Commission must publish the results of the studies carried out under this regulation.
.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
   
It entered into force on 1 January 2011.
BACKGROUND
The EU has opened up the rail freight market to competition since 1 January 2007. However, market mechanisms have not been and are not sufficient to organise, regulate and secure rail freight traffic. To optimise the use of railway infrastructure and ensure its reliability it is useful to introduce additional procedures to strengthen cooperation on allocation of international train paths for freight trains between infrastructure managers between Member States.

For more information, see:
EU securities settlement rules (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
Central securities depository (CSD): a central bank that holds securities and securitised securities.
Central counterparties: banks that provide securities settlement services.

European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) — Investment for growth and jobs goal and specific provisions concerning the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal (Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013)
European regional development fund (ERFD) — investment for growth, jobs and innovation goal
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the types of activities that can be supported by the ERDF under the investment priorities of the EU’s investment priorities for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
It repeals Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The ERDF is the main instrument of the European Union (EU), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMF).
It is designed to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the EU. The ERDF contributes to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
Types of activities eligible for ERDF funding
EU countries must designate one or more categories of regions to be eligible for funding under the European territorial cooperation goal. These categories are:
research and innovation, information and communication technologies (ICT), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promoting a low-carbon economy;
carbon economy.
In addition, activities (e.g. energy efficiency investments in district heating networks, smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems and measures aimed at reducing air pollution) are eligible for support, even if one of the indirect effects of such activities is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or if they are listed in the national plan referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.
Cohesion Fund funding
The EU countries must ensure that:
the ERDF supports research and innovation (R & ICT) and SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) activities;
the investment priorities relating to the shift towards a low carbon economy (i.e. promoting the creation of jobs and growth of the SME sector);
investments in the areas of energy efficiency and smart energy transmission systems.
The European Territorial Cooperation goal (ETCo)
The ETFCo goal is a common objective of the ERFD, the ESF and the EMF. It aims to:
contribute to the EU strategy for smart and sustainable growth, thus ensuring greater concentration of ERDF support on the priority of the Union;
increase the contribution of regions with less than 75 % of GDP per capita to the overall ERDF programming;
provide support to regions with a GDP of 75 % or less per capita in line with the specific needs of EU countries’ national strategies;
support the development of islands and islands with a population of less than 2 000 inhabitants, as well as regions with more than 25 % of the GDP of an EU country in terms of their contribution to the total ERDF programme.
Scope of the regulation
The regulation defines the type of activities which can be funded under the ETFO goal. It does not apply to activities that are not listed in Annex I of the EEFO directive, such as:
energy efficiency investments;
energy distribution networks;
smart energy distribution systems;
measures aimed at improving the efficiency of energy markets;
transport infrastructure;
environmental protection measures;
agriculture and rural development.
Exemptions
In order to avoid excessive financing, activities that do not contribute to achieving the EU's investment priorities are excluded from the scope of this regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
   
 
It has applied since 20 December 2013.
BACKGROUND
The ErDF was established under Article 176 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Europe (TFEU).

European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) — specific provisions for the support from the European Regional Development fund to the European territorial cooperation goal
European Regional development fund (ErdF) — special rules for the European Territorial Cooperation goal
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on specific provisions relating to the EU’s territorial development goal
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out specific rules concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the ERDF, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation sets out the scope, geographical coverage, financial resources, thematic concentration and investment priorities, programming, monitoring and evaluation, technical assistance, eligibility, management, control and designation, participation of non-EU countries, and financial management.
European territorial cooperation
The ERDF supports cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation in order to contribute to the harmonious development of the EU's territory at different levels.
Cross-border cooperation aims to tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions, such as: poor accessibility, especially in relation to information and communication technologies (ICT) connectivity and transport infrastructure, declining local industries, an inappropriate business environment, lack of networks among local and regional administrations, low levels of research and innovation and take-up of ICT, environmental pollution, negative attitudes towards neighbouring country citizens and the untapped growth potential in border areas (development of cross-boundary research facilities and clusters, labour market integration, cooperation among education providers, including universities or between health centres), while enhancing the cooperation process for the purpose of the overall harmonious growth of the Union.
Transnational cooperation should aim to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion policy priorities, and also include maritime cooperation not covered by crossborder cooperation programmes, including urban-raging cooperation, as well as research-intensive cooperation between urban regions and urban regions.
Interregional co-operation should enhance the effectiveness of territorial cooperation programmes by encouraging the exchange of experience and knowledge between regions and universities, research institutes and other institutions, and by promoting cooperation between research centres and universities.
Research and innovation
The European Research and Innovation (R&I) Framework (ERIF) aims to encourage research and innovative research and development (R & I) activities in the regions of the Member States and regions of other Member States. It also aims to improve the knowledge-based approach to R & I, and to promote the integration of R&I in the European labour market.
Cooperation between the regions and the universities, universities and other research institutions
The aim of the ERIF is to encourage the exchange and exchange of best practice in the fields of research, innovation and knowledge-intensive research and the creation of research clusters. The ERDF provides financial support for the implementation of these programmes.
Programmes
The programme authorities, programme authorities and authorities in participating Member States, at local, regional or national level, as appropriate, are responsible for:
programming the programmes;
monitoring and evaluation the programme;
assisting the European Commission in implementing the programme.
Financing
The budget for the programme is allocated according to the criteria set out in the regulation. It is divided into 4 categories:
the general ERDF budget;
the regional regional development fund budget; and
the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) budget.
Participation of the Commission
The Commission is responsible for administering the programme for the period 2014-2020. The Commission must submit a report to the national parliaments every 3 years on how the programme has been implemented and the results of the evaluation. The report must include information on the number of beneficiaries, the number and type of projects funded, the total number of projects financed and the total amount of financial resources allocated.
The report must also provide information on:
participation of EU countries in the programme,
the number of countries and regions participating in the project and the number or type of grants received;
how the programme was implemented, and
results of the evaluations.

The regulation applies to:
jurisdiction of the transmitting or receiving agency or one agency to perform both functions, for a period of 5 years;
the service of a document on the party’s authorised representative in the country where the proceedings are taking place regardless of the place of residence of that party.
Requests for service
The request for service must be made in the official language of the EU country in which the document is to be served. It must be accompanied by a standard form, to be completed in that language or in another official language accepted by the country in question.
The receiving agency must inform the addressee in writing using the standard form that he may refuse to accept a document to be transmitted in a language other than that of the receiving agency within one month of receipt by the sending agency or within one week of receiving agency.
In exceptional cases, the sending and receiving agencies may refuse service of the document to the addingressee if the following conditions are met:
the document is not understood by the returning agency within a week of receipt;
it has not been served within a month of receiving the document.
the sending agency has not transmitted the document within a year of receiving it;
there is no obligation to transmit the document in another language than the one it has been transmitted in.
EU countries may designate one or more agencies to carry out both functions. This designation may, however, be renewed every five years.
Transmission and service
EU country authorities must ensure that:
judicial and other legal documents are transmitted directly and by rapid means between local bodies designated by the EU countries;
they are transmitted in the standard forms set out in the annexes to the regulation;
transmission is carried out in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 61 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(5), second indent, of the Convention on the Service of Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters (Council of Europe Convention of 1997).

Summary 169:
EU-Iceland agreement on the surrender procedure (2006-2020)
EU-Ireland agreement on:
the surrender procedure
SUMMARY OF:
Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the extradition procedure between the EU and Iceland and Norway
Decision 2006/852/EC on the signature, on behalf of the EU, and provisional application of the Agreement between the Union and Iceland on the European Arrest Warrant
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters between EU countries and Iceland.
The decision approves the signature and the provisional application by the EU of the agreement.
KEY POINTS
The EU and the EU countries are parties to a number of international conventions in the field of extradition, including the European Convention on extradition of 13 December 1957 and the Convention on the suppression of terrorism of 27 January 1977.
In accordance with the provisions of this agreement, the surrender for the purpose of prosecution or execution of sentence shall be based on the principles of fundamental rights and in particular the EU Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
A judicial authority of the country where the requested person has been arrested shall have to take the decision on his or her surrender. This decision must be subject to sufficient controls.
An arrest warrant shall not be issued on grounds of nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, political opinion or any other objective reason. Nor shall the warrant be issued for reasons of punishing a person who has been convicted of a crime or who is likely to be punished by the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Iceland and Norway have uniform extradition laws with a common concept of extradition. However, Iceland has expressed their wish to enter into an agreement enabling them to expedite arrangements for handing over suspects and convicts with the EU. The European Union also considers it desirable to have such an agreement in place.
EU countries are obliged to ensure that the extradition system between, on the one hand, the EU country and Iceland, and on the other hand, Norway, is based on minimum standards, taking account of the terms of the Convention of 27 September 1996 relating to extradition.
When an arrest warrant is issued, it must be executed by the competent authorities of the requesting country. The central authorities may provide practical and administrative assistance in the execution of the warrant, but may not be involved in the decision-making process of the requested country.
No person should be surrendered to a country where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death sentence, torture, other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. The requested country may refuse to execute the warrant on the grounds of the following reasons:
a person has not been informed of the reasons for refusing to surrender;
the person is a national of another EU country; or
the requested person is of a particular ethnic, racial or religious origin.
If a person is refused to surrender on the basis of the above reasons, the request may be referred to the competent authority of that country. In this case, the requesting EU country must inform the other EU countries of the reason for the refusal. If the requested EU country considers that the refusal is justified, it may, under certain conditions, refuse to issue the warrant. In such cases, the country which has issued the warrant must notify the other parties of its reasons for refusal.
Where the request for surrender is refused, the requested party must be informed of these reasons in writing. The request may also be made in the form of a request for a judicial declaration. The requesting party must also be informed, in writing, of the conditions under which the warrant is to be executed. In the case of the refusal of a person to surrender, the person concerned must be provided with all the necessary information, including: the nature of the offence, the nature and duration of the sentence, the circumstances of the arrest warrant, and the circumstances under which it was issued.
Any person who refuses to surrender must be given the opportunity to appeal against the decision of the judicial authority. The person who is refused the right of appeal, in particular, to be heard in a court of law and to be represented by an independent lawyer. In addition, if the person is found to be a danger to public order or to public security, the right to a lawyer must be taken into account when the decision is taken.
This agreement does not prevent a country from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, the freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media and freedom to engage in other forms of media. It does, however, prevent the granting of judicial authorisation to an individual who has not complied with the conditions laid down in the agreement to be granted an authorisation.
