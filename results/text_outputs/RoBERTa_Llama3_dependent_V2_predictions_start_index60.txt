FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 May 2021.
BACKGROUND
The unprecedented measures taken in response to the exceptional situation caused by COVID-19, which is beyond the control of Member States, have caused significant disturbances to economic activity which are reflected in a steep decline in gross domestic product and a significant impact on employment, social conditions, poverty and inequalities. In particular, those measures have disrupted supply chains and production and caused absences from the workplace. In addition, the provision of many services has become very difficult or impossible. At the same time, consumer demand has dropped. Many businesses are experiencing liquidity shortages, and their solvency is at risk, while the financial markets are very volatile. Key sectors like travel and tourism are particularly hard hit.
The crisis caused by COVID-19 has spread quickly in the Union and in third countries. A sharp contraction of growth in the Union is foreseen for 2020. Recovery risks being very uneven in different Member States, increasing the divergence between national economies. The different fiscal abilities of Member States to provide financial support where it is needed most for recovery and the divergence between Member States’ measures endanger the single market as well as social and territorial cohesion.
A comprehensive set of measures is needed for economic recovery. That set of measures requires substantial amounts of public and private investment to set the Union firmly on the path towards a sustainable and resilient recovery, create high-quality jobs, support social inclusion and repair the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 crisis, whilst supporting the Union’s green and digital priorities.
As this Regulation is an exceptional response to temporary but extreme circumstances, the support provided under it should only be made available for the purposes of addressing the adverse economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis or the immediate funding needs to avoid a re-emergence of the COVID-19 crisis.

Sanctions in the preventive part of the SGP
If the Council adopts a decision establishing that a Member State has failed to take action in response to a recommendation from the Commission, the Commission shall recommend that the Council require the Member State in question to lodge an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission amounting to 0.2 % of its GDP in the preceding year.
The Council may decide to reduce or cancel the deposit on the basis of a reasoned request from the Member State concerned. The Commission may also recommend reducing or cancelling the deposit on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances.
If the Council decides that the situation giving rise to the Council recommendation has come to an end, the deposit and the interest accrued thereon shall be returned to the Member State concerned.
Sanctions in the corrective part of the SGP
If the Council decides that a Member State has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit, the Commission shall recommend that the Council impose a fine on the Member State amounting to 0.2 % of its GDP in the preceding year. The fine shall be converted into a non-interest-bearing deposit if the Member State has already lodged an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission.
The Commission may also recommend reducing or cancelling the fine on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request from the Member State concerned.
If the Council decides to abrogate some or all of its decisions, the non-interest-bearing deposit shall be returned to the Member State concerned.
Sanctions concerning the manipulation of statistics
The Council may decide to impose a fine on a Member State that intentionally or by serious negligence misrepresents deficit and debt data relevant for the application of Articles 121 or 126 TFEU or for the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU.
The fines shall be effective, dissuasive and proportionate to the nature, seriousness and duration of the misrepresentation. The amount of the fine shall not exceed 0.2 % of GDP of the Member State concerned.
The Commission may conduct investigations necessary to establish the existence of the misrepresentations. It may decide to initiate an investigation when it finds that there are serious indications of the existence of facts liable to constitute such a misrepresentation.
The Commission shall fully respect the rights of defence of the Member State concerned during the investigations.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 11 concerning:
detailed criteria establishing the amount of the fine;
detailed rules concerning the procedures for the investigations, the associated measures and the reporting on the investigations;
detailed rules of procedure aimed at guaranteeing the rights of the defence, access to the file, legal representation, confidentiality and provisions as to timing and the collection of the fines.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has unlimited jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Council imposing fines under the regulation. It may annul, reduce or increase the fine so imposed.
The sanctions imposed pursuant to Articles 4 to 8 of the regulation are of an administrative nature.
The interest earned by the Commission on deposits lodged in accordance with Article 5 and the fines collected in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 shall constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 TFEU, and shall be assigned to the European Financial Stability Facility. When the Member States whose currency is the euro create another stability mechanism to provide financial assistance in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole, the interest and the fines shall be assigned to that mechanism.

 Strategic Innovation Agenda 2021-2027 for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is an EU agency that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship in Europe by supporting the development of new ideas and the creation of innovative products, services and business opportunities. The EIT is an important pillar of the European Union’s research and innovation programme Horizon Europe. The EIT aims to boost the innovation capacity of Europe by supporting the development of new ideas and the creation of innovative products, services and business opportunities. The EIT does this through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together universities, research institutes, companies and entrepreneurs to develop new ideas and innovative solutions to major global challenges. The EIT also supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS). The EIT supports the KICs in developing and implementing their multiannual strategies, which define their priorities and activities for the period from 2021 to 2027. The EIT is based in Budapest and has a network of 5 co-location centres across the EU.
WHAT DOES THE STRATEGIC INNOVATION AGENDA DO?
It sets out the priority fields and the strategy of the EIT for the period from 2021 to 2027.
It also reflects Regulation (EU) 2021/695, and, in particular, the key role of the EIT as part of Pillar III ‘Innovative Europe’ of Horizon Europe, and its contribution to addressing global and societal challenges, including established targets and commitments to climate objectives and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to Pillar I ‘Excellent Science’ and Pillar II ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’ of Horizon Europe.
It builds on the lessons learnt over the previous years of operation of the EIT and the results of a wide consultation process with key stakeholders.
It contributes to tackling global and societal challenges, including the SDGs by following the principles of the Paris Agreement adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (2), and to achieving a net-zero greenhouse gas economy by 2050 at the latest.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the KICs, including through the involvement of new partners in other sectors, countries and regions, in order to address disparities in innovation capacity and to enhance knowledge and innovation diffusion across the EU.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the RIS, which is intended to act as a catalyst for innovation and knowledge transfer by providing support for the KICs’ activities and by promoting the development of innovation ecosystems across the EU.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the integration of the knowledge triangle, integrating higher education activities in the innovation value chain, which is a distinctive feature of the EIT compared to other innovation instruments.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture and the creation of new businesses.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the promotion of the EIT label, which is awarded to the KICs’ education programmes and which is expected to have a more structuring effect at all levels (individual, programme and institution).
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the promotion of the EIT as a one-stop shop for innovation, which facilitates the access of European Innovation Council (EIC) beneficiaries to the KICs’ innovation ecosystems and relevant actors of the knowledge triangle.

 swordfish — multiannual recovery plan
SUMMARY
The aim of this Regulation is to implement the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Mediterranean and Black seas. This recovery plan was adopted by the ICCAT at its 2016 annual meeting in Vilamoura, Portugal.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that Mediterranean swordfish are fished in a sustainable way, in order to allow the stock to recover.
KEY POINTS
The recovery plan sets out a number of measures for the fishing industry and recreational fisheries.
Fishing effort
A limit is placed on the number of fishing vessels allowed to fish for Mediterranean swordfish, depending on the type of fishing gear used.
The fishing season
A closure period is set, during which no fishing may take place for Mediterranean swordfish. This period is from 1 January to 31 March of each year. In addition, a closure period is set for longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from 1 October to 30 November of each year.
Minimum conservation reference size
The minimum conservation reference size for Mediterranean swordfish is 100 cm.
Technical characteristics of the fishing gear
The hook size of the fishing gear used to catch Mediterranean swordfish is limited to 7 cm in height.
Landings and transhipments
Landings and transhipments of Mediterranean swordfish must take place in designated ports, and the vessels carrying them must be authorised to do so.
Inspections
The Commission, or a body designated by it, may assign Union inspectors to the ICCAT scheme for joint international inspection, which is set out in Annex III to this Regulation.
Recreational fisheries
Only ‘rod and line’ vessels may be authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish in recreational fisheries.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 15 July 2018.
BACKGROUND
Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is a large migratory species that is found in the Mediterranean and Black seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. It is an important commercial species and is also highly prized in recreational fisheries.
Mediterranean swordfish has been overfished over the last 30 years and its current status does not allow it to produce the maximum sustainable yield in the short term. In order to allow the stock to recover, a multiannual recovery plan was adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its 2016 annual meeting in Vilamoura, Portugal.
This Regulation implements this recovery plan into Union law.
For further information, please see the factsheet on the ICCAT recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish.

 Multiannual financial framework 2014–2020
SUMMARY
The multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘MFF’) is set out in Regulation (EU) No 966/2012. This regulation determines the ceilings for expenditure and revenue for the general budget of the European Union (EU) for the period 2014-2020.
What is the MFF?
The MFF sets out the ceilings for expenditure and revenue for the general budget of the European Union (EU) for the period 2014-2020. It also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF.
The MFF is a seven-year planning and programming tool for the EU. It ensures a stable and predictable framework for the implementation of the EU budget and for the planning of EU policies.
The MFF consists of:
—
a set of expenditure ceilings for each of the headings of the EU budget (smart and inclusive growth, sustainable growth: natural resources, security and citizenship, global Europe and administration);
—
an own-resources ceiling, which limits the total amount of own resources that can be collected from the EU countries.
The MFF also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF. These instruments are the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the global margin for commitments for growth and employment, in particular youth employment.
What is the purpose of the MFF?
The MFF is a seven-year planning and programming tool for the EU. It ensures a stable and predictable framework for the implementation of the EU budget and for the planning of EU policies.
The MFF sets the annual ceilings for expenditure for the different headings of the EU budget. These ceilings are based on the EU’s priorities and objectives. They are used to determine the appropriations for expenditure (commitments and payments) for each of the headings.
The MFF also sets the own-resources ceiling, which limits the total amount of own resources that can be collected from the EU countries.
The MFF also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF. These instruments are the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the global margin for commitments for growth and employment, in particular youth employment.
When does the MFF apply?
The MFF applies from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
Revision of the MFF
The MFF may be revised in compliance with the own-resources ceiling set in Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom.
The Commission may present a proposal for revision of the MFF in the event of unforeseen circumstances that cannot be dealt with within the ceilings established as part of the MFF. It may also present such a proposal in the event of enlargement of the EU, of the revision of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), or of the reunification of Cyprus.
The MFF may also be revised in the event of:
—
an implementation of the budget;
—
measures linking effectiveness of funds to sound economic governance;
—
a revision of the TFEU;
—
an enlargement of the EU;
—
a reunification of Cyprus.

Summary 86:
 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making
SUMMARY
Better law-making is the aim of this Interinstitutional Agreement. The agreement was signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 13 April 2016. It sets out a number of measures which the three institutions will take to improve the quality of EU legislation.
WHAT DOES THIS AGREEMENT DO?
It sets out a number of measures which the three institutions will take to improve the quality of EU legislation.
KEY POINTS
The three institutions agree to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
In exercising their powers and in compliance with the procedures laid down in the Treaties, and recalling the importance which they attach to the Community method, the three institutions agree to observe general principles of Union law, such as democratic legitimacy, subsidiarity and proportionality, and legal certainty.
They further agree to promote simplicity, clarity and consistency in the drafting of Union legislation and to promote the utmost transparency of the legislative process.
The Commission will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council respectively, both before and after the adoption of its annual Work Programme (the Annual Programming – Commission Work Programme and interinstitutional programming).
Following the adoption of the Commission Work Programme and drawing on it, the three institutions will exchange views on initiatives for the coming year and agree on a joint declaration on annual interinstitutional programming (the joint declaration), to be signed by the presidents of the three institutions.
The three institutions will monitor, on a regular basis throughout the year, the implementation of the joint declaration.
To that end, the three institutions will participate in debates on the implementation of the joint declaration in the European Parliament and/or the Council during the spring of the year in question.
The Commission Work Programme will include major legislative and non-legislative proposals for the following year, including repeals, recasts, simplifications and withdrawals.
The Commission will take due account of, and respond to, the co-legislators' positions.
The Commission will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of its Work Programme for the year in question.
The three institutions agree on the positive contribution of impact assessments in improving the quality of Union legislation. Impact assessments are a tool to help the three institutions reach well-informed decisions and not a substitute for political decisions within the democratic decision-making process. Impact assessments should cover the existence, scale and consequences of a problem and the question whether or not Union action is needed.
The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality should be fully respected, as should fundamental rights.
Impact assessments should also address, whenever possible, the ‘cost of non-Europe’ and the impact on competitiveness and the administrative burdens of the different options, having particular regard to SMEs (‘Think Small First’), digital aspects and territorial impact.
The Commission will carry out impact assessments of its legislative and non-legislative initiatives, delegated acts and implementing measures which are expected to have significant economic, environmental or social impacts.
The European Parliament and the Council will, when they consider this to be appropriate and necessary for the legislative process, carry out impact assessments in relation to their substantial amendments to the Commission's proposal.
The Commission may, on its own initiative or upon invitation by the European Parliament or the Council, complement its own impact assessment or undertake other analytical work it considers necessary.
The three institutions are responsible for determining how to organise their impact assessment work, including internal organisational resources and quality control.
Public and stakeholder consultation is integral to well-informed decision-making and to improving the quality of law-making.
Without prejudice to the specific arrangements applying to the Commission's proposals under Article 155(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission will, before adopting a proposal, conduct public consultations in an open and transparent way, ensuring that the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation. The Commission will in particular encourage the direct participation of SMEs and other end-users in the consultations. This will include public internet-based consultations.
The results of public and stakeholder consultations shall be communicated without delay to both co-legislators and made public.
Ex-post evaluation of existing legislation
The three institutions confirm the importance of the greatest possible consistency and coherence in organising their work to evaluate the performance of Union legislation, including related public and stakeholder consultations. The Commission's evaluation planning will respect the timing for reports and reviews set out in Union legislation. Where appropriate, such requirements can include measurable indicators as a basis on which to collect evidence of the effects of legislation on the ground. The three institutions shall inform each other in good time before adopting or revising their guidelines concerning their tools for Better Law-Making (public and stakeholder consultations, impact assessments and ex-post evaluations).
The Commission will provide, in relation to each proposal, an explanation and justification to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding its choice of legal basis and type of legal act in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal.
The three institutions agree that the choice of legal basis is a legal determination that must be made on objective grounds which are amenable to judicial review. The Commission shall continue to fully play its institutional role to ensure that the Treaties and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union are respected.
The three institutions underline the important role played by delegated and implementing acts in Union law. It is the competence of the legislator to decide whether and to what extent to use delegated or implementing acts, within the limits of the Treaties.
The three institutions have agreed on a Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and on the related standard clauses (the Common Understanding), annexed hereto.
In accordance with the Common Understanding and with a view to enhancing transparency and consultation, the Commission commits to gathering, prior to the adoption of delegated acts, all necessary expertise, including through the consultation of Member States' experts and through public consultations.
Experts from the European Parliament and from the Council shall systematically have access to the meetings of Commission expert groups to which Member States' experts are invited and which concern the preparation of delegated acts.
The Commission may be invited to meetings in the European Parliament or the Council in order to have a further exchange of views on the preparation of delegated acts.
The Commission will carry out its role as facilitator by treating the two branches of the legislative authority equally, in full respect of the roles assigned by the Treaties to the three institutions. The three institutions will keep each other regularly informed throughout the legislative process about their work, about on-going negotiations among them and about any stakeholder feedback that they may receive, via appropriate procedures, including dialogue between them.
To that end, in the context of the legislative process, they will facilitate mutual exchange of views and information, including by inviting representatives of the other institutions to informal exchanges of views on a regular basis.
The European Parliament and the Council will, in the interest of efficiency, ensure a better synchronisation of their treatment of legislative proposals.
The three institutions agree to coordinate efforts to accelerate the legislative process while ensuring that the prerogatives of the co-legislators are respected and that the quality of legislation is preserved.
The three institutions acknowledge the importance of ensuring that each Institution can exercise its rights and fulfil its obligations enshrined in the Treaties as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements.
The three institutions

 Citizens’ Initiative Regulation
SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 on the citizens’ initiative
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the procedure for the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI), a new right that gives European citizens the opportunity to ask the European Commission to propose new EU legislation.
KEY POINTS
Who can organise an ECI?
Citizens of one EU country cannot organise an ECI alone, but must form a committee of at least 7 citizens from 7 different EU countries.
Citizens must be of the age to vote in European Parliament elections.
Organisers may be individuals or organisations, such as political parties or non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
How does the ECI work?
The procedure is in 4 steps:
1. Organisers form a committee and submit the proposed ECI to the European Commission via an online register. The Commission then checks that the ECI meets the legal requirements and decides whether to register it.
2. The Commission registers the ECI if it meets the legal requirements and publishes it on the register.
3. The organisers then collect the necessary number of statements of support from citizens.
4. If the minimum number of statements of support is reached, the Commission examines the ECI and presents its conclusions to the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission then decides whether to present the ECI to the European Parliament and the Council.
How many signatures are needed?
At least 1 million signatures from at least 1 million citizens from at least 1 quarter of EU countries.
The number of signatures needed is degressively proportional to the population of each EU country. The minimum number of signatures required in each EU country is set out in an annex to the regulation.
