Summary 5:
Dissemination of terrorist content online: removal orders and sanctions
Distribution of terrorist material online: removing orders
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/302 on the removal of websites hosting terrorist content
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that hosting service providers and users’ trust in the online environment can be restored by removing terrorist content.
It sets out rules to prevent and combat the dissemination of such material.
KEY POINTS
The regulation establishes a definition of ‘terrorist content’ for preventative purposes, consistent with the definitions of relevant offences under Directive 2017/541 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2009/23/EC.
Hosting service providers have the right to submit, within 48 hours of receiving either a removal order or information concerning terrorist content, a reasoned request to the competent authority of the EU country where the hosting service provider has its main establishment or where its legal representative resides or is established to scrutinise the removal order.
The competent authority must then determine whether the content is terrorist content and, if so, whether it should cease to have legal effects.
If it finds that the content does not comply with the regulation’s terms and conditions, it may issue an order to remove the content or to disable access to it.
Where it is impossible to identify the Member State in which the content was disseminated, the host service provider must notify the contact point in the country where they have their main establishment, place of residence or where their legal representative is established, and transmit information concerning that terrorist content to Europol for appropriate follow-up.
When a Member State finds that a Member States’ competent authorities have not identified the Member States concerned, it must inform the contact points in those Member States and send the relevant information to the European Anti-Fraud Office (Europol).
The contact points must:
assess the content and its compatibility with the content of the service providers’ own terms of service;
ensure that the provider has the necessary technical and organisational safeguards to prevent any unintended or erroneous decision leading to the removal or disabling of access to content that is not terrorist content;
implement safeguards, where appropriate, including human oversight and verifications, to avoid any unintended and erroneous decision resulting in the removal, disabling or blocking access to the content that does not meet the conditions of service.
Implementing measures
Member States must ensure that their competent authorities carry out their tasks under this regulation in an objective and non-discriminatory manner while fully respecting fundamental rights. They must also ensure that:
the content and related data are preserved;
the removal order and the information provided by the service provider is reviewed within 24 hours of receipt;
a reasoned request is made to the relevant authority of that Member State to review the order and to determine whether it is valid;
an EU country may impose penalties for infringements of this regulation if it considers that the infringements are likely to lead to a breach of the rights of its nationals or of its legal representatives.
In addition, Member States may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU of the Treaty on European Union (TFEU), to impose sanctions on hosting services providers and content providers that fail to comply with this regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGUMENT APPLY?
   
It has applied since 7 June 2018 and had to become law in the EU Member States by 7 June 2023.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has published a report on the application of the regulation to date.

Summary 23:
Dumping of products from non-EU countries to the EU — EU countries’ national markets
Dumping on products originating in non-European countries to be sold in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — dumping and injury to the Union’s industry
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for the imposition of duties on imports of certain products originating outside the European Union (EU).
It aims to protect the interests of the EU industry by preventing the dumping of these products by EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all imports of goods originating in the European Economic Area (EEA) from the EU countries of origin.
Importers may be subject to duties if:
they are:
exporting products of the same general category of products to a country other than the EU country of origin;
they have a legitimate interest in selling the same products in the domestic market of that country;
the export price of the products is below the normal value of those products in that country.
The dumping margin is the amount by which the import price exceeds the export price.
Provisional or definitive measures may be imposed by the Commission on the basis of a complaint from an exporter or producer of a product originating in an EU country to the country of importation of a similar to that of the country in question.
Duties may also be imposed on imports originating in another EU country, provided that:
the actual amounts applicable to production and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, for the exporters or producers in question are not less than the amount for profit normally realised by other exporters and producers on sales of products originating from the same country in the same category of goods in that same country, are not more than the actual amounts for profit;
there is a significant difference in the level of trade between the exporting countries and the EU as a whole.
Exemptions
The Commission may grant exemptions to exporters, producers or other interested parties if the following conditions are met:
an adequate amount of information has been provided by the exporter, producer or producer in question, or by a representative of an interested party, is available to the Commission;
a sample of the relevant products has been taken into account in the calculation of the dumping margin;
exporters or producers have been given the opportunity to submit information and make comments in accordance with Article 5 of the regulation;
any other reasonable method of investigation has been used to establish the amount of the duty for profit.
If the Commission considers that an adequate undertaking has not been offered promptly or the situations set out in Article 8(9) and (10) apply, it may impose a provisional or definitive duty in respect of the whole EU. The Commission may also decide to impose a definitive duty on a specific EU country if it considers that the measures have had an adverse effect on the EU’S industry.
Investigations may be initiated on the initiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State or any interested party on the grounds that the import of a particular product is likely to have an adverse impact on the Union industry or that the EU interest calls for intervention to prevent such injury.
An investigation may be opened if the Commission is satisfied that the imports of a specific product originate in a country that is not a member of the EEA or that there is a substantial difference between the import prices of the imported product and the export prices of that product in the relevant EU country. If the investigation is opened, it must be concluded within 6 months of the date of initiation of the investigation.
In the event of a failure to conclude the investigation, the Commission may reopen the investigation to examine whether the measure has had effects on the abovementioned prices.
Disputes may be settled by a settlement of the dispute between the EU and the exporting country or between the importing country and the producer of the product.
Where a dispute is settled by an agreement between the two parties, the dispute may be referred to the Court of Justice of the EC.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
The legislation has applied since 1 July 2017.

Summary 24:
Countervailing duties on imports from non-EU countries — rules on the application of the EU’s anti-dumping and countervailing measures
Countervailable duties on imported imports from countries other than the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 on protection against dumped imports
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to protect the EU agricultural sector against the alleged dumping of goods from countries not members of the European Union (EU).
It lays down rules on how the European Commission may impose countervailable tariffs on imports of agricultural products originating from outside the EU.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to imports originating in the EU and exported to the EU from countries that are not EU members.
It does not apply to imports from the EU countries’ own territory.
Importers may use a quantity of home market inputs equal to, and having the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs as a substitute for them in order to benefit from this provision if the import and the corresponding export operations both occur within a reasonable time period, not to exceed 2 years.
The Commission may decide to impose a duty on imports if it considers that the imports constitute a threat to the economic interests of the producer or the EU as a whole. The Commission may also impose a definitive duty if it believes that they constitute a risk to the economy of the country in which the imports are made.
Duties are calculated on the basis of:
the cost of the imports;
the price of the inputs;
a market benchmark for the inputs in the importer is set by the EU country of origin or export.
the market benchmark does not exist in the country where the imports originate or export
the amount to a percentage of the total value of the goods imported.
Where the Commission considers that imports from a non-member EU country are not being dumped, it may impose a provisional duty on the imports. If the definitive duty is lower than the provisional duty, the duty shall be recalculated.
Procedure
If the Commission finds that imports are being dumped or that are likely to be dumped, the Commission may apply a countervailed duty. The duty may be imposed on imports originating or exported from the country of the origin or the country exporting the goods.
An investigation may be initiated by the Commission to determine whether or not the alleged subsidies are ‘specific’ within the meaning of Article 4(2) and (3) of the regulation.
If a complaint is made by a producer or an importer, the complaint must be made to the Commission within 5 working days of the date on which the Commission decides to impose the duty.
A complaint may be made by the producer, importer or a user of the imported goods if:
it is likely to result in a loss of income or injury to the producer; or
the producer or importer has not been able to obtain a comparable commercial loan which the firm could actually obtain on the market.
Disputes may be settled by a dispute settlement procedure.
In the event of a dispute, the dispute resolution procedure may be referred to the European Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Mechanism (EACSM).
The EACSM is composed of representatives of the producers, importers and their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations. It is responsible for:
reviewing the application and application of this regulation;
providing the Commission with all the information it needs to make a decision;
assisting the Commission in its investigations;
advising the Commission and the other EU countries in the case of disputes.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
Directive 2014/60/EU on the protection of the agricultural sector from the dumping of products originating or exporting from the countries of origin and/or export (codified version) has applied since 1 July 2014.
Regulations (EU, EFTA and EFTA countries) had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2016.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a number of measures to protect its agriculture sector against dumping. These include:
Protection against dumping of agricultural goods originating in or exported by non-members of the Union (Protection Against Dumping of Agricultural Goods) — see summary;
Protected imports — see overview;

Summary 30:
Reporting of breaches of EU law that are harmful to the public interest (EU environmental acquis)
Reporting breaches of Union law — EU environmental aquis
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2017/943 on the protection of whistleblowers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to protect whistle-blowers who report breaches* of EU environmental protection laws.
It seeks to ensure that EU countries’ competent authorities deal with reports of serious breaches or breaches of essential provisions falling within the scope of this directive as a matter of priority, without prejudice to the timeframe as set out in the directive’s Article 3(2) of the EU acquis.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to breaches of environmental protection law, including:
the procurement rules involving defence or security aspects;
the European Union (EU)-wide rules on the sale of goods, services and intellectual property rights; and
the EU-wide rules governing the use of trade secrets.
EU countries must ensure that:
reporting persons have the necessary grounds to believe that a breach constitutes an imminent or manifest danger to public interest, such as where there is an emergency situation or a risk of irreversible damage; or
the breach may constitute a low prospect of the breach being effectively addressed, due to the particular circumstances of the case.
Reporting persons normally feel more at ease reporting internally, unless they have reasons to report externally. However, the directive does not apply to the protection granted to workers when reporting breaches of European employment law (e.g. the right to collective agreements and collective agreements).
Reporting people may be subject to certain conditions, including the following:
a breach may be disclosed if:
there is a risk to public health or safety;
it may constitute an imminent danger to the safety of the public;
there may be a high risk of retaliation or there is a high prospect of irreparable damage.
National authorities must:
ensure that reporting persons have access to the competent authorities’ databases;
assess whether a breach is likely to be serious;
have the necessary resources to deal with the breach;
handle the report in a timely manner;
make available to the reporting person all the necessary information in order to investigate the breach.
If a person reports or publicly discloses information on breaches falling within this directive, and that information includes trade secrets, and where that person meets the conditions of this Directive, such reporting or public disclosure shall be considered lawful under the conditions laid down in Article 3 of the directive (EU acquis).
The person who makes the report may be subjected to a number of restrictions, including a ban on the publication of the information or the disclosure of the name of the person who made the report.
The reporting person may be prevented from disclosing the name or contact details of the persons responsible for the breach or the person responsible for investigating the breach if they:
have a legitimate interest in protecting the safety or the health or the environment of the reporting persons;
may not disclose the identity of the perpetrator or the persons involved in the breach, in particular if they have a right to do so under national law;
are subject to a ban or banishment from the territory of the Member State in which the breach took place.
Where a Member State considers that the breach is serious, it may close the procedure regarding a reported breach on account of it being clearly minor or on account the report being repetitive, or if the report does not deserve priority treatment.
Penalties
The Directive provides for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties applicable in respect of reporting persons where it is established that they knowingly reported or publicly disclosed false information.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
The legislation entered into force on 1 July 2017. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2018.

Reclaimed water quality requirements for agricultural irrigation — minimum requirements for urban waste water treatment plants for agricultural use
Reclaimed waters used for irrigation
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/852 — minimum water reuse requirements for water reuse
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to encourage the sustainable use of water.
It sets out minimum requirements to be met by reclamation facilities for the reuse of treated urban wastewater for agricultural purposes.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to treated municipal wastewater from urban waste treatment plants that are reused, in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC, for the purpose of agricultural irrigation.
The reclamation facility operator is responsible for the quality of the reclaimed water at the point of compliance.
Reclamation facilities must have a permit issued by the competent authority of the EU country in which they are located. The permit sets out the obligations of the operator and, where relevant, of any other responsible parties.
EU countries must notify the European Environment Agency (EEA) of the reclamation plant operator’s name, the type of water treatment plant and the type and quantity of waste water to be reused, as well as the number of people and animals to be exposed to the risk of contamination.
In order to effectively protect the environment and human and animal health, the operator must draw up, publish and update, on a regular basis or following a request from the EEA, a water reuse risk management plan to ensure that the water is in compliance with the minimum requirements. The plan should include information and awareness-raising campaigns to raise public awareness of the importance of water reuse and the need to take preventive measures to reduce the risk to human, animal and plant health and the environment.
If the water does not comply with the water reuse minimum requirements, EU countries must take the necessary measures to ensure it is treated in a way that does not endanger human or animal health or the environment, and that the risk can be managed with a view to reducing the impact of an incident on the environment or human or plant health.
Where the water source is not a water body used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption or a relevant safeguard zone designated pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC, the water must be treated in an urban wastewater treatment plant.
To ensure that water reuse is carried out in a manner that minimises the risks of contamination, the facility operator must:
ensure that the treated water is treated and disinfected in an appropriate treatment plant;
provide the relevant authorities with the necessary information and information on the re-use of the treated wastewater;
implement a risk-management plan to minimise the risks associated with the use of reclaimed water;
take the necessary preventive measures, such as use of personal protective equipment, handwashing and personal hygiene, to reduce human and plant exposure to the water, and to prevent the contamination of foodstuffs and animal feed;
establish a risk management system to assess the impact on human, plant, animal or human health of any incident that may occur;
monitor the water treatment process and the results of the monitoring and monitoring of the water re-treatment process;
assess the risk management process and draw up a risk assessment plan to assess whether the water treated in the treatment plant meets the minimum minimum requirements;
draw up a report on the water-recovery risk management plans and the risk assessment process to assess how the water has been managed;

use an acquirer outside their own EU country to acquire the funds on behalf of the payee;
use a payment card to make a payment in another EU country.
Provide the acquirer with the funds to make the payment in the other than the one in which the payment is made in the country in which it is made.
Scope of the regulation is limited to the use of a specific payment instrument (e.g. debit card, credit card or internet payment).
It does not cover:
the issuing of payment cards jointly by issuers and payment card schemes and revenue from processing, licensing and other fees providing revenue to the schemes;
the use of the payment card infrastructure for the processing of payment transactions or related activities;
any agreed remuneration, including net compensation, with an equivalent object or effect of the interchange fee, received by an issuer from the payment scheme, acquirer or any other intermediary in relation to payment transactions and related activities.

Eurojust — rules for the operation of the European Union’s criminal justice system (Eurojust)
Eurojust – rules forthe operation of Eurojust
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on the legal framework for the organisation of the Eurojust Criminal Justice System
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for Eurojust, the EU institution responsible for preventing and combating crime in the EU.
It aims to ensure that Eurojust is independent of any EU institution, body, office or agency that has the competence to carry out its tasks.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies that are responsible for investigating, investigating, prosecuting or investigating criminal offences, as well as to non-EU countries and international organisations.
The European External Action Service (EEAS) is responsible for the management of the EEA and Eurojust.
Decision 2008/852/JHA established Eurojust in 2008. It is an independent body under the responsibility of the Council of the EU, the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the European Police and Criminal Investigation Office (Europol).
The EEA is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and has a budget of €1 billion. It works closely with the EU countries’ national law enforcement authorities (NHSs) in order to prevent, investigate, prosecute and prosecute criminal offences.
EU countries have the right to request Eurojust to provide them with information on criminal offences in their territory.
In order to investigate and prosecute crime, Eurojust can:
provide Eurojust with information to the NHSs and Europol;
ensure Europol has direct access to information provided by Eurojust;
request Europol to have indirect access, on the basis of a hit/no-hit system, to Eurojust information provided to Europol, without prejudice to any restrictions indicated by the Member State, EU body, Office or agency, third country or international organisation that provided the information in question.
Europol has the right, under certain conditions, to request information from Eurojust if it is necessary for the legitimate performance of tasks covered by the competence of the other EU institution or body, body or office.
EEA countries may, in exceptional cases, refuse to cooperate with Eurojust or Europol if they consider that the information they provide could be used to commit a criminal offence in another EU country.
National authorities may refuse to comply with a Eurojust request if they believe that the request would harm national security, public policy, public health, public safety, public order or public health or if it would be contrary to the interests of the national authorities concerned. They may, however, refuse the execution of the request, justifying its position in every case.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
The legislation entered into force on 12 December 2018.
BACKGROUND
The EU institution is one of a number of international organisations that work together to combat crime, including the United Nations Office for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OPTO).

Ensuring the protection of the EU’s maritime industry against injurious pricing in the EU and non-EU countries by means of a trade defence mechanism (Regulation (EU) 2016/1036) (codified by Regulation (EU, 2016/1136)
Ensuing the protection for the Union's maritime industry from injurious prices in the European Economic Area (EEA)
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EEA) No 1036/2016 on the application and implementation of trade defence measures to combat injurious price discrimination in the field of maritime trade
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules to protect the interests of the European Union (EU), the EU countries’ maritime industry and the European Commission (the European Economic and Social Committee (EEC) against the unfair pricing of vessels exported to the EU by non-members of the EEA.
The regulation codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 182/2011, which had been amended several times.
KEY POINTS
Scope
It applies to the sale of like vessels in the domestic market of the exporting country, or export sales to a third country, at prices below unit production costs (fixed and variable) plus selling, general and administrative costs, and may be treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price.
It defines the export price and the adjustments which should be made in those cases where a reconstruction of that price from the first open-market price is deemed necessary.
Importers must notify the Commission of the price at which the vessel was sold to an independent buyer or is resold in the condition in which it was originally sold, on any reasonable basis.
An investigation may be initiated if the sale is at a price below the normal value of the vessel, or if the vessel is not resold to a buyer in the same condition as it was sold in the original sale.
If the price is below normal value, the complaint must be made to the competent authorities of the importing country or the EU country.
A complaint may be made by the shipbuilder, the buyer or any other interested party.
Investigations
The Commission may open an investigation if:
the sale of a like vessel is below the price of a comparable vessel in the market of an EU country;
the vessel is imported into the EU at a lower price than the market price of that vessel in that country; or
the shipbuilder or the buyer is an exporter of a similar vessel to that of the same vessel.
Where the price to price comparison is not possible, the investigation must be concluded no later than 1 year from the date of initiation of the sale or the date on which the comparable vessel was delivered.
Disclosure of confidential information
If a complaint is made, the Commission must disclose all information, made available by any party to an investigation, as distinct from internal documents prepared by the EU or its Member States, which is relevant to the presentation of their cases and not confidential within the meaning of Article 13 of the regulation, and is used in the investigation.
In the event that the Commission considers that the information provided by the complainants is not relevant to its investigation, it may suspend the investigation or terminate the investigation without prejudice to the complaint.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
The legislation entered into force on 16 February 2016.
BACKGROUND
   
 
The EEA has been working towards a common approach to combating injurious trade pricing in maritime trade since 2013.

Summary 56:
Supply chain due diligence of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas — EU system for traceability and traceability
Suppliers of minerals originating in conflict areas must ensure that they source, at least partially, from those areas.
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/852 — supply chain due-diligence of minerals coming from conflict areas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that suppliers of minerals to the EU supply chain are responsible for the sourcing of these minerals.
It sets out a system to trace back the origins of the minerals they source.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to the supply chain of minerals that come from:
conflict areas;
high-risk regions;
sustainable development areas; and
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).
It does not apply to minerals originating from the EU’s external borders.
Importers must:
check whether suppliers source minerals from the conflict areas covered by the regulation;
ensure that they have carried out due diligence checks;
check that the suppliers have complied with their supply chain obligations;
assess the security of their supplies;
conduct ex-post checks on the suppliers’ compliance with the regulation.
EU countries must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for applying the regulation, including EU countries’ competent authorities, to carry out the checks.
The Commission must draw up a list of global responsible smelters and refiners covered by supply-chain due diligence schemes.
This list must be drawn up taking into account of the information supplied by the EU countries and the information submitted by EU countries to the Commission. The Commission must keep that list up-to-date and update it every 3 years.
In addition, the Commission must identify those companies that source minerals that source at least part of their supply from conflict affected and high risk areas, in particular by drawing upon information provided by the owners of supply chain* diligence schemes recognised pursuant to Article 8.
If the Commission considers that a supplier has not complied with its due diligence obligations, it must inform the European Commission of the reason for the omission or omission of a mineral from the list of companies covered by this regulation and of the measures taken by the Commission to identify the companies responsible for sourcing minerals from these areas. If the Commission determines that a company does not comply with its obligations, the company may be subject to a ban on the supply of the mineral or to a suspension of its supply chain for at least 5 years. The ban may be lifted if the company is found to have fulfilled its obligations under this regulation or if it has been found to be in breach of its obligations in another EU country.

Information on fuels and tyres
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 on the labelling of tyres on new heavy-duty vehicles
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down minimum requirements for the fuel efficiency and wet grip of tyres.
It sets out the minimum requirements to be met by re-treaded tyres for new heavy duty vehicles.
KEY POINTS
Fuel efficiency
The regulation sets out minimum fuel efficiency requirements for tyres fitted on new vehicles. It does not apply to tyres that are already placed on the market.
Wet grip is the ability of a vehicle to brake on wet surfaces, such as snow, ice or mud, without having to brake at all.
External rolling noise is the noise produced by tyres on the road when the vehicle is being driven. It is caused by the friction of the tyres against the road surface and by the vibrations of the wheels.
The European Commission has adopted delegated acts in order to supplement this regulation by introducing new information requirements for re-readed tyre types, provided that a suitable testing method is available.

Summary 96:
Preservation of a debtor’s bank account in a cross-border case
Preserved bank accounts
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — a system for the preservation of a bank account
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out a system to enable a creditor to recover debts from a debtor in an EU country where the debtor has an account in another EU country.
It aims to improve the protection of the personal data of the debtor in the event of the loss of that bank account.
KEY POINTS
   
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU countries which are bound by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
It does not apply to EU countries that have jurisdiction to rule on the substance of the matter.
The creditor may request a preservation order from the court of the EU country in which the debtor is domiciled in order to recover his or her bank account or to which he or she is a permanent resident.
A creditor may also request an order from a court in a non-EU country to:
restore the bank account to the debtor or to the bank with which he/she has a direct or indirect connection; or
transfer the funds to the account of the creditor in the country of origin.
Implementation
The order must be served on the debtor within 3 working days of receipt of a declaration from the bank in which it is issued.
If the creditor is satisfied that the debtor‘s bank accounts have been preserved, the creditor may release the funds and transfer them to an account designated for preservation in the creditor.
Where the creditor has a bank with a direct connection with the debtor, the order may be issued by the court in that country, or by the bank designated as coordinating entity for the purpose of the preservation in a given case.
Creditors may request that the information needed to identify the debtor's bank account be obtained from the designated information authority of the country to which the creditor believes the debtor holds an account. If the creditor does not have access to this information, the court may refuse to issue the order.
When a creditor is not satisfied that all the conditions and requirements for issuing the order are met, the debtor may ask the court to issue an order to restore the funds.
In the event that the creditor fails to fulfil the information requirement, he/her/it may ask for the information to be transmitted to the competent enforcement authority of that country. If that request is refused, the bank is authorised to release funds preserved and to transfer those funds to another bank for the purposes of paying the creditor's claim, if all the following conditions are met:
the bank is specifically indicated in the order in accordance with point (j) of Article 19(2);
the law of the enforcement country allows for such release and transfer; and
there are no competing orders with regard to the accounts concerned.
Requests for information
The court must transmit the request for information to the information authority in the relevant EU country of enforcement by the end of the third working day following receipt of the declaration showing that amounts have been conserved. The court must then inform the debtor of any subsequent implementation of the national order granted. The debtor may also appeal against any decision of the court rejecting, wholly or in part, his application for a Preservation Order.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
The Regulation entered into force on 1 July 2017.
BACKGROUND
 
  * KEY TERMS

Summary 97:
Search and rescue in the event of a distress situation in the territorial sea or contiguous zone of the Schengen acquis (SAR)
Search and rescues in the area of the maritime domain
SAR
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 on the coordination and cooperation between EU countries’ search and rescue authorities and the competent authorities of non-EU countries in the sea
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the coordinated and coordinated search-and-rescue operations carried out by EU countries and their participating countries in order to rescue migrants who are in distress at sea.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
the territorial sea and contiguous zones of the European Union (EU), i.e. the sea in which the EU has its external borders;
the maritime domain in which it has its own external borders.
It does not apply to non-European Union (Nordic) countries, Iceland, Norway or the Kingdom of Finland.
The purpose of border surveillance is to prevent unauthorised border crossings, to counter cross-border criminality and to apprehend or take other measures against those persons who have crossed the border in an irregular manner.
Interception of stateless vessels
If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a stateless vessel is carrying persons intending to circumvent the checks at border crossing points or is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea, the host EU country or the neighbouring participating EU country in whose territorial sea that vessel is intercepted may authorise one or more of the measures laid down in this regulation.
Coordination and cooperation
The participating EU countries must cooperate with each other and with the International Coordination Centre (ICC) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to identify a place of safety for the rescued persons.
Each participating country must have at least one person with basic first aid training.
If a vessel is found to be in distress, the participating country and the host country must provide the responsible rescue coordination centre with information on the vessel’s operating efficiency and the situation where the vessel is likely to be found in distress. The participating country may then instruct the participating unit accordingly through the ICCOS.
When a vessel in distress is found in the contiguous zone, it must be rescued as soon as possible.
Where a vessel has been found to have been in distress for more than 24 hours, the competent national authorities of the participating countries must inform the participating units of any contact with ICOS and of the course of action taken by them.
Rescue of rescued persons
The rescued persons must be brought to a place where they can be delivered to safety. If that is not possible, disembarkation must take place in the host or neighbouring country.
Participating countries must ensure that:
each participating unit has at least 1 person with first-aid training;
each unit must have an operational plan for the operation;
participation in the operation must include details adapted to the circumstances of the sea operation concerned.
In the case of search and recovery operations, participating units must inform ICOS of any information that indicates that the operating efficiency of a vessel may be impaired to the extent that a severe distress situation is likely;
if information is received which indicates that an operating efficiency is likely, the responsible rescuers must identify a safe place to be located and, when the responsible centre designates such a place, they shall ensure that disembarkation is carried out rapidly and effectively.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the tasks of the European System of Supervisors (ESAs), the European Union’s (EU) financial supervision body, which is responsible for supervising financial institutions across the EU.
It aims to strengthen the role of the ESAs in preventing and resolving financial crises.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all financial institutions in the EU, including banks, insurance companies, pension funds and credit rating agencies.
The ESAs are responsible for:
supervision of the financial system of the EU as a whole;
assessment of the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments;
monitoring the financial activities of EU countries’ financial institutions;
providing advice to the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council.
Evaluation

Duties
The EBA, the EBA and the ESA must:
ensure that financial institutions comply with the relevant EU law;
take all necessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under EU law.
In order to ensure efficient and effective supervision and a balanced consideration of the positions of the competent authorities in different EU countries, the authority must be able to settle disagreements in cross-border situations between those competent authorities with binding effect, including within colleges of supervisors.
Dispute settlement
The competent authorities concerned may, in accordance with the procedure set out in the third and fourth subparagraph of Article 44(1) of the regulation, take specific action or refrain from action in order to settle the matter, with binding effects for the relevant authorities concerned.
If a dispute cannot be settled within the conciliation phase, the competent authority may take a decision requiring them to take specific actions or to refrain from taking specific action.
Where a decision taken by the competent national authority impinges on its fiscal responsibilities, it may notify the authority and the Commission within 2 weeks of notification of the decision.
Resilience
The authority must assess whether a financial institution has the necessary resilience to deal with market developments and, if so, whether it should be allowed to continue to carry out its activities. If it considers that the financial institution does not have the resilience to meet its obligations, it must take the necessary action, including suspending its activities, to prevent it from continuing its activities or to halt its operations.
Sanctions
The Authority may impose sanctions on financial institutions that fail to comply with EU law, including:
suspension of their activities;
restrictions on their access to the financial markets;
banishment of their operations;
prohibition of the use of certain financial instruments;
the suspension of the activities of certain other financial institutions.

Enforcement of cross-border infringements of consumer rights — EU countries’ coordinated action mechanism
Enforcement mechanisms — EU country’s coordinated action mechanisms
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The regulation aims to ensure that EU countries have coordinated action to prevent and combat widespread infringements by traders of consumer goods and services.
It sets out a system of cooperation between EU countries and the European Commission to investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of such infringements.
KEY POINTS
Scope
This regulation applies to all EU countries, except Denmark, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (1).
It does not apply to EU countries that do not participate in the Schengen acquis (the single market).
The European Commission has the power to issue external alerts to the competent authorities of the relevant Member States and the Commission of suspected infringements covered by this regulation and to provide the necessary information available to them.
EU countries must notify the Commission if they have a reasonable suspicion that a widespread infringement with a Union dimension has occurred.
The Commission must then notify the other EU countries concerned within 1 month of receiving the notification.
Coordinated action
The competent authorities must notify each other of the information they have received, including:
the identity of the trader responsible for the alleged infringement,
the acts or omissions committed by the trader
the nature of the infringement
the extent to which the infringement had an impact on consumers
the number of consumers affected by the infringement and
the effects of the infringements
the name and contact details of the EU country concerned.
If the Commission receives a request for information, it must inform the relevant authorities in the relevant EU country of the country in which the suspected infringement has occurred and provide them with the information that is necessary to prove that the infringement has taken place.
Where the Commission has reasonable suspicion of an infringement, it should notify the competent authority in the country where the infringement took place and provide it with all the information it has requested.
A coordinated action may also be launched if the Commission considers that an EU country is likely to obtain information or to bring about a cessation or a prohibition of the alleged infringements in a manner that is at least as efficient and effective as the instructing authority would have done.
An EU country may designate a coordinator to coordinate the coordinated action and designate a designated body to assist in the investigation and the prohibition of infringements under this regulation. The designated body is responsible for:
providing the Commission with information on the alleged widespread infringement;
coordinating with the other competent authorities, the single liaison offices, the European Consumer Centres, consumer organisations and associations, and, where appropriate, trader associations;
ensuring that the designated body has the necessary expertise;
promoting cooperation between the Commission and the EU countries on the enforcement of the regulation;
assisting the Commission in the coordination of other activities contributing to investigation and enforcement, such as the exchange of information and the sharing of best practice.

SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
The regulation sets out rules to ensure that the debtor’s assets are preserved in the territory of the EU country in which the company or group of businesses has been insolvent.

KEY POINTS
Scope
This regulation applies to:
the main and secondary proceedings;
the group coordination proceedings.
The main proceedings may be opened by the court of an EU country which has jurisdiction over the debtor.
the court of a non-EU country may open a type of proceedings as listed in Annex A of the regulation, provided that the conditions for opening the proceedings are fulfilled and that that that type is the most appropriate for the interests of the local creditors and coherence between the main and the secondary proceedings
the proceedings may only be opened if the debtor is insolvent in a country other than the one in which opened the proceedings

The court of the country where a debtor is domiciled may decide to open the proceedings in a different EU country if the creditor has not been able to prove that they have the assets of the company in question.
Where a debtor has failed to pay its creditors, the court in that country has jurisdiction in the case of the main proceedings. The court of that country may order that the creditor be paid the amount due to the creditor in respect of the assets that have been lost or that have not been returned to the debtor in the course of the proceedings. If the creditor does not have the funds to pay the creditor, the creditor may ask the court to order the creditor to pay that amount. The creditor may also request that the court order the payment of the creditor's assets in the other EU country to be paid by the creditor.
Decision-making procedure
The decision of the first court to open proceedings should be recognised in all other EU countries without those EU countries having the power to scrutinise that court's decision. The decision should be published in the national newspapers of that EU country where the proceedings have been opened.
In addition, the decision should also be published, at the request of the bankruptcy proceedings practitioner, in a court other than that of the court which delivered that decision.

Regulation 2014/65/EU — common requirements for the establishment, operation and supervision of securities settlement* systems
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The regulation sets out common rules on the establishment and operation of a securities settlement system (CSD) in the EU.
It aims to ensure that securities settlement services are provided by a single EU-wide network of CSDs (i.e. a single market for securities settlement).
It also sets out the conditions for their authorisation and recognition by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
KEY POINTS
Scope of the regulation
It applies to:
CSDs established in EU countries or in non-EU countries;
third-country CSDs that provide services outside the EU;
non-banking-type ancillary services provided by CSDs.
Scope
A CSD must establish procedures that facilitate settlement of transactions in financial instruments referred to in the regulation’s Annexes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, N and N.
The rules apply to the following services:

It sets out the rules for the allocation of resources from the EU’s regional development funds to the EU territorial cooperation goals.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out how the ERDF is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
The ERDF supports integrated actions to tackle the economic, environmental, climate, demographic and social challenges affecting urban areas, while taking into account the need to promote urban-rural linkages.
In order to achieve these objectives, the regulation defines three thematic objectives:
Investment for growth and jobs — at least 5 % of the total ERDF resources at national level are to be allocated to the Investment for Growth and jobs goal;
Innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development (i.e. actions that aim to develop sustainable urban strategies to address the social, economic and environmental challenges that affect urban areas and to improve the quality of life in urban areas;
Sustainable growth — at national and local level, through the creation of sustainable cities, sub-regional or local bodies responsible for implementing sustainable urban policies and strategies;
Integrated actions for sustainable urban areas — at local and regional level, where cities, regional or local authorities are responsible for the selection of operations in accordance with Article 123(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1303/2013, or, where appropriate, in the case of urban authorities, for tasks relating, at least, to the selection and implementation of these actions.
Regional cooperation goal — at EU level, at national or local level:
at least 50 % of ERDF funding at national levels shall be allocated for two or more of the thematic objective set in out in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of the regulation (see summary);
in less developed regions: at least 12 % will be allocated in line with the investment for growth or jobs goal, and at least 10 % of its resources will be devoted to the investment objectives set out in point 5 of the second paragraph of this regulation (See summary).
Innovation — at European level, the European Commission will designate a managing authority responsible for selecting the urban areas where integrated actions for Sustainable Urban Development will be implemented, and the indicative amounts for those actions will be set in the Partnership Agreement with a minimum of 5% of the resources allocated at national for that purpose. The managing authority will then formally record its decision in writing.

Where a judgment has been declared enforceable by a court of a country bound by the convention, the court of that country has jurisdiction over that judgment.
Judgments may be enforced in any EU country where they have been or are to be enforced. The judgment may also be enforced by the courts of a non-EU country if the judgment has not been enforced in the country in which it has been enforced.
If the judgment is not enforceable, the judgment may be brought before an appellate court in another EU country.
A judgment may not be enforced if the party against whom enforcement is sought fails to appear before the appellate court for an appeal brought by the applicant, or if the appeal is brought by a person who is not a citizen of the party to the contract.
