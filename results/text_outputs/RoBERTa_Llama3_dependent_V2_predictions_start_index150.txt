Summary 155:
 safety and transparency in the settlement of financial transactions
SUMMARY
SETTLEMENT OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Settlement of financial transactions plays a key role in the financial markets. It is the process that transfers ownership of securities from the seller to the buyer.
The settlement process is complex and involves several players, such as banks, investment firms, central securities depositories (CSDs) and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs). In the absence of uniform rules, this has led to a fragmentation of the settlement process across the EU. This Regulation aims to ensure the safety and transparency of the settlement process for financial transactions in the EU.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules on the settlement of financial transactions and on the activities of CSDs, which operate securities settlement systems.
KEY POINTS
Settlement of financial transactions
The Regulation lays down rules on the settlement of financial transactions in order to ensure the safety and transparency of the settlement process.
The Regulation applies to the settlement of all financial instruments, such as transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, unless otherwise specified in the Regulation.
The Regulation requires CSDs to ensure the timely settlement of securities transactions and the integrity of the securities issue. The Regulation also requires CSDs to monitor settlement fails, which are transactions that have not been settled on the intended settlement date. It also establishes rules for the buy-in and the sell-out procedures to address settlement fails.
Activities of CSDs
The Regulation also lays down rules on the activities of CSDs. CSDs must provide certain core services, which consist of settlement, implying the operation of a securities settlement system, notary and central securities accounts maintenance services.
CSDs must also provide certain ancillary services, such as custody, safe custody and sub-custody services, which contribute to enhancing the safety, efficiency and transparency of the securities markets.
The Regulation also lays down rules on the authorisation and supervision of CSDs. CSDs are subject to authorisation and supervision by competent authorities in the EU. The competent authorities are responsible for ensuring that CSDs comply with the requirements of the Regulation. They may impose administrative penalties and other measures in the event of non-compliance with the Regulation.
The Regulation establishes a system of recognition for third-country CSDs, which are CSDs established outside the EU. Third-country CSDs that intend to provide certain services or to set up a branch in the EU must be recognised by ESMA. The Regulation also lays down rules on the application of the prudential requirements applicable to CSDs.
The Regulation contains rules on the capital requirements of CSDs and of credit institutions that are part of the same group of undertakings as a CSD.
The Regulation lays down rules on the law applicable to proprietary aspects in relation to the securities held in the accounts maintained by CSDs.
The Regulation provides that CSDs may provide services in other Member States, including through setting up a branch. It lays down rules on the authorisation and supervision of CSDs operating in other Member States.
The Regulation establishes a system of recognition for third-country CSDs that intend to provide certain services or to set up a branch in the EU.
The Regulation lays down rules on the cooperation between competent authorities.

Summary 158:
 European territorial cooperation goal
SUMMARY
This Regulation establishes the scope of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal and lays down specific provisions concerning that goal.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the scope of the ERDF with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal and lays down specific provisions concerning that goal.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The European territorial cooperation goal covers cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
The scope of the ERDF with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal includes:
cross-border cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions in different Member States;
transnational cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions within the same Member State;
interregional cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions in different Member States.
Cross-border cooperation
The regions to be supported for cross-border cooperation are the NUTS level 3 regions* of the European Union along all internal and external land borders other than those covered by programmes under the external financial instruments of the Union, and all NUTS level 3 regions of the Union along maritime borders separated by a maximum of 150 km.
The Commission adopts a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the list of cross-border areas to receive support, broken down by cooperation programme.
Transnational cooperation
The European territorial cooperation goal also covers transnational cooperation programmes, which aim to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion policy priorities, and which also include maritime cross-border cooperation not covered by cross-border cooperation programmes.
Interregional cooperation
The European territorial cooperation goal also covers interregional cooperation programmes, which aim to reinforce the effectiveness of cohesion policy by developing and testing new approaches and good practices in the fields of territorial development and cooperation.
Resources for European territorial cooperation goal
The outermost regions* are allocated not less than 150 % of the ERDF support they received in the 2007-2013 programming period for cooperation programmes.
Each Member State receives an allocation from the ERDF, broken down by cooperation programme, for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. Member States may use the flexibility between the components of the European territorial cooperation goal, and are encouraged to allocate at least 80 % of their allocation to cross-border cooperation.
Thematic concentration and investment priorities
At least 80 % of the ERDF allocation to each cross-border cooperation and transnational cooperation programme must be concentrated on a maximum of four of the thematic objectives set out in the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
The ERDF must also support cooperation between the Union and its neighbouring third countries, including through specific arrangements, in order to offset the higher administrative costs.
Cooperation programmes
Cooperation programmes must:
set out the objectives of the cooperation programme;
set out the priority axes and their objectives;
set out the actions to be implemented;
set out the indicators to be used to measure the progress of implementation;
set out the management and control systems;
set out the arrangements for the involvement of partners.
Monitoring and evaluation
The managing authority must submit annual implementation reports to the Commission, which must include information on:
the implementation of the cooperation programme;
the progress in preparation and implementation of major projects and joint action plans.
The Commission must assess the implementation reports and, if necessary, decide on the need for an interim review meeting.
Indicators for the European territorial cooperation goal
For common and programme-specific output indicators, baselines must be set at zero.
Technical assistance
The amount of the ERDF allocated to technical assistance must be limited to 6 % of the total amount allocated to a cooperation programme.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
              
The European territorial cooperation goal covers cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
Cross-border cooperation aims to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reduce the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
Transnational cooperation aims to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion policy priorities, and aims to also include maritime cross-border cooperation not covered by cross-border cooperation programmes.
Interregional cooperation aims to reinforce the effectiveness of cohesion policy by developing and testing new approaches and good practices in the fields of territorial development and cooperation.

BACKGROUND
The European Commission's ‘Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond — A Blueprint for an integrated European energy network’ communication of 2011 called for a new energy infrastructure policy to optimise network development at European level for the period up to 2020 and beyond, in order to allow the Union to meet its core energy policy objectives of competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
The Commission has identified 12 strategic trans-European energy infrastructure priorities, the implementation of which by 2020 is essential for the achievement of the Union's energy and climate policy objectives.
The European Council of 4 February 2011 underlined the need to modernise and expand Europe's energy infrastructure and to interconnect networks across borders, in order to make solidarity between Member States operational, to provide for alternative supply or transit routes and sources of energy and to develop renewable energy sources in competition with traditional sources.
The European Council of 18 June 2011 called for the development of the Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) in order to contribute to the development of the internal market in energy and to the security of energy supply.
The European Council of 24-25 May 2012 called for a new European industrial policy, which includes a new energy infrastructure policy.

Summary 161:
 2014-2020 direct payments: EU countries to get better value for their money
EU countries are to get better value for their money from direct payments to farmers from 2014 to 2020. The reform will ensure that the money goes to those farmers who need it most, while helping to protect the environment and rural areas.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for direct payments* to farmers under the common agricultural policy (CAP) from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
KEY POINTS
The reform of the CAP introduced in 2013 provides for a gradual reduction in direct payments and for the introduction of ‘greening’*, a new set of rules for farmers.
Direct payments
Direct payments are divided into 2 categories:
basic payments for farmers and
coupled support for young farmers, small farms and farms in less-favoured areas.
The basic payment scheme
Under the basic payment scheme, each farmer receives a flat rate for the area of his or her holding, regardless of the type of crops grown. This replaces the single payment scheme, which is abolished from 2014.
The basic payment scheme is a key instrument for the convergence of direct payments per hectare in the EU. It will be progressively adjusted to take account of the differences in the cost of production between Member States.
To ensure that the support is better targeted, Member States may decide not to grant direct payments to certain natural and legal persons unless such persons can demonstrate that their agricultural activity is not marginal.
EU countries may also decide to grant a reduction of direct payments to large beneficiaries. The proceeds of the reduction of payments to large beneficiaries are to be made available as support for rural development measures financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
The basic payment scheme is subject to certain conditions:
the payment is granted only to farmers who are active in farming;
the payment is granted only to farmers who are established in the EU;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not exceeded the ceiling fixed by the EU country;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not exceeded the ceiling fixed by the EU country for young farmers, small farms or farms in less-favoured areas.
Young farmers, small farms and farms in less-favoured areas
Farmers who are young, small or in less-favoured areas receive a coupled support, which is based on the area of their holding. The support is calculated as a flat rate per hectare of eligible land.
The support for young farmers is granted only to farmers who are under 40 years old, who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
The support for small farms is granted only to farmers who are not young and who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
The support for farms in less-favoured areas is granted only to farmers who are not young or small and who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
EU countries may decide to grant a reduction of direct payments to large beneficiaries. The proceeds of the reduction of payments to large beneficiaries are to be made available as support for rural development measures financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
EU countries may decide to transfer funds from their direct payments ceiling to their support assigned for rural development.
The EU country may decide to use part of its direct payments ceiling to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in areas with specific natural constraints.
EU countries may decide to use part of their direct payments ceiling to support the production of protein crops.
The EU country may decide to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in areas with specific natural constraints.
EU countries may decide to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in the following areas:
the outermost regions*;
the smaller Aegean islands*;
the mountainous regions*;
the islands*;
the regions suffering from serious difficulties*.

The service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU
The service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU
SUMMARY:
This Regulation establishes an area of freedom, security and justice in civil and commercial matters in the European Union (EU). It covers the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a system for the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU. It provides for the transmission of judicial documents between the agencies designated by the EU Member States for this purpose. It also provides for the service of judicial documents in the Member States in which they are to be served.
KEY POINTS
The Regulation applies to the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters between Member States. It does not apply to revenue, customs or administrative matters or to liability of the State for actions or omissions in the exercise of state authority (acta iure imperii).
The Regulation does not apply where the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.
Each Member State designates the public officers, authorities or other persons competent for the transmission of judicial or extrajudicial documents to be served in another Member State and those competent for the receipt of judicial or extrajudicial documents from another Member State.
The designation has effect for a period of 5 years and may be renewed at 5-year intervals.
Each Member State provides the European Commission with the following information:
the names and addresses of the receiving agencies;
the geographical areas in which they have jurisdiction;
the means of receipt of documents available to them; and
the languages that may be used for the completion of the standard form.
The Commission is notified of any subsequent modification of such information.
The Commission publishes the information communicated in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Regulation provides for the transmission of judicial documents directly and as soon as possible between the agencies designated pursuant to Article 2.
The documents to be transmitted are accompanied by a standard form which is completed in the official language of the Member State addressed or in another language which that Member State has indicated it can accept.
The documents and all papers that are transmitted are exempted from legalisation or any equivalent formality.
The applicant is advised by the transmitting agency to which he forwards the document for transmission that the addressee may refuse to accept it if it is not in one of the languages provided for in Article 8.
The applicant bears any costs of translation prior to the transmission of the document.
On receipt of a document, a receiving agency sends, as soon as possible and in any event within 7 days of receipt, a receipt to the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means of transmission using the standard form set out in Annex I.
If the request for service cannot be fulfilled on the basis of the information or documents transmitted, the receiving agency contacts the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means in order to secure the missing information or documents.
If the request for service is manifestly outside the scope of the Regulation or if non-compliance with the formal conditions required makes service impossible, the request and the documents transmitted are returned, on receipt, to the transmitting agency, together with the notice of return using the standard form set out in Annex I.
A receiving agency receiving a document for service but not having territorial jurisdiction to serve it forwards it, as well as the request, to the receiving agency having territorial jurisdiction in the same Member State if the request complies with the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) and informs the transmitting agency accordingly using the standard form set out in Annex I. That receiving agency informs the transmitting agency when it receives the document, in the manner provided for in paragraph 1.
The receiving agency serves the document or has it served either in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed or by a particular method requested by the transmitting agency, unless that method is incompatible with the law of that Member State.
The receiving agency takes all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within 1 month of receipt.
The receiving agency informs the addressee that he may refuse to accept the document at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within 1 week if it is not either in a language which he understands or in the official language or one of the official languages of the place of service. This rule also applies to service by diplomatic or consular agents, service by postal services and direct service. It is established that the service of the refused document can be remedied through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.
The receiving agency continues to take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document also in cases where it has not been possible to effect service within the month, for example, because the defendant has been away from his home on holiday or away from his office on business.
Where according to the law of a Member State a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant is that determined by the law of that Member State.
The receiving agency informs the addressee in writing using the standard form that he may refuse to accept the document at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within 1 week if it is not either in a language which he understands or in the official language or one of the official languages of the place of service. This rule also applies to service by diplomatic or consular agents, service by postal services and direct service. It is established that the service of the refused document can be remedied through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.

WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a common procedure for the assessment and authorisation of food additives, enzymes and flavourings in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
This regulation sets out the stages of the procedure for updating the list of authorised substances and the role of the parties involved.
The European Commission (the EU’s executive body) sets up the procedure and, where necessary, seeks the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
The EFSA provides an independent scientific assessment of the risks that the substances pose to human health.
The Commission then takes a risk management decision based on the opinion of the EFSA and other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration.
The Commission publishes a list of authorised substances.
The procedure can be started either by the Commission or following an application by an interested party.
The Commission informs the Member States and, where applicable, requests the opinion of the EFSA.
The EFSA delivers its opinion within 9 months of receipt of a valid application.
If the EFSA requests additional information, the procedure may be extended.
The Commission submits a draft regulation to the Committee for Food Safety, which then takes a decision within 24 months.
The Commission may decide not to proceed with a planned update if it judges that such an update is not justified.
The Commission updates the list of authorised substances.
The Commission may request additional information on risk management issues from applicants.
The Commission decides whether the information provided is sufficient and whether it should proceed with the update.
The Commission may decide not to proceed with the update.
The Commission publishes the list of authorised substances.
The procedure ends with the adoption of a regulation updating the list of authorised substances.
The Commission may decide not to proceed with a planned update if it judges that such an update is not justified.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 20 January 2009.
BACKGROUND
This regulation complements the sectoral food laws on food additives, enzymes and flavourings, which establish the criteria for authorising these substances.
It completes the regulatory framework concerning the authorisation of the substances by laying down the stages of the procedure, the deadlines for those stages, the role of the parties involved and the principles that apply.

Summary 175:
 control scheme for fishing vessels in the Convention Area
SUMMARY
The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a scheme of control and enforcement applicable to fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area which lies beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties (the Regulatory Area). The scheme provides for control and enforcement measures applicable to vessels flying the flag of Contracting Parties and operating in the Regulatory Area, and arrangements for inspection at sea which include inspection and surveillance procedures and infringement procedures which must be implemented by the Contracting Parties.
The scheme also comprises provisions to promote compliance by vessels flying the flag of a non-Contracting Party with the control and enforcement measures in order to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC. The Regulation incorporates the NEAFC scheme into Union law.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The Regulation applies to:
the landing or transhipment of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party;
fishing vessels flying the flag of a non-Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area;
EU fishing vessels and fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area.
Monitoring measures
The Commission must be informed by the end of each year of the vessels authorised to fish in the Regulatory Area, as well as any subsequent amendments. It must forward this information to the NEAFC Secretary.
Vessels flying the flag of a Member State must carry on board:
a valid fishing licence;
a fishing logbook or an electronic logbook;
a valid catch certificate.
EU vessels may only engage in transhipment operations or joint fishing operations with vessels flying the flag of a Contracting Party and vessels of a non-Contracting Party granted the status of a cooperating non-Contracting Party by NEAFC.
Inspections at sea
NEAFC inspectors may board a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Contracting Party at any time, day or night, and without prior notice being given to the vessel. The vessel must provide the inspectors with any assistance which is required. The duration of an inspection must not exceed 4 hours, or the time it takes to haul in the net and to inspect the net and the catch, whichever is longer.
The Commission or the body designated by it must send to the NEAFC Secretary before 1 January each year details of the plan, including the names of the NEAFC inspectors and special inspection vessels as well as the types of aircraft and their identification details (registration number, name, radio call-sign) which Member States are assigning to the Scheme during that year.
Port state control of fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party
Member States must designate and notify the Commission of ports where the landing or transhipment of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party are permitted.
When the master of a fishing vessel carrying fish intends to call into a port to land or tranship fish, he must notify the competent authorities of the Member State of the port he wishes to use no later than three working days before the estimated time of arrival.
Landing or transhipment operations may only start after authorisation has been given by the competent authorities of the port Member State. Such authorisation shall only be given if the confirmation from the flag state has been received.
Each Member State must carry out inspections of at least 15 % of landings or transhipments in its ports during each reporting year.
Infringements
The Regulation applies to EU fishing vessels and to fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area.
The Commission or the body designated by it must forward the information to the NEAFC Secretary.
Reporting and follow-up of infringements
The Commission or the body designated by it must compile a Union report on the basis of the reports of the Member States.
Reporting of non-Contracting Parties’ activities
The Commission or the body designated by it must send a global report on non-Contracting Parties’ activities to the NEAFC Secretary by 1 March each year.
Confidentiality
The Commission or the body designated by it may grant access to the inspectors to the databases, registers and other information held by the Commission or the body designated by it, or by the Member States, which are relevant for the purpose of carrying out the inspection and surveillance procedures, provided that such access is granted on a case-by-case basis and that the confidentiality of the information is preserved.

 Ecolabel for environmentally friendly products
The EU Ecolabel is a voluntary scheme that aims to encourage the marketing of products and services that are environmentally friendly throughout their life cycle. It is awarded to products and services that have a high level of environmental performance, verified by an independent body.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It establishes a framework for the EU Ecolabel scheme, which is intended to promote products and services that have a high level of environmental performance.
It sets out the conditions under which the EU Ecolabel may be used, in particular the conditions for the award of the label and the market surveillance and control of its use.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The EU Ecolabel scheme covers products and services that are supplied for distribution, consumption or use in the EU, whether in return for payment or free of charge.
It does not apply to medicinal products for human use or for veterinary use, or to any type of medical device.
Criteria
EU Ecolabel criteria are based on the environmental performance of products, taking into account the latest strategic objectives of the EU in the field of the environment.
In determining such criteria, the following are considered:
the most significant environmental impacts, in particular the impact on climate change, the impact on nature and biodiversity, energy and resource consumption, generation of waste, emissions to all environmental media, pollution through physical effects and use and release of hazardous substances;
the substitution of hazardous substances by safer substances, as such or via the use of other substances.
EU Ecolabel criteria include requirements intended to ensure that the products bearing the EU Ecolabel function adequately in accordance with their intended use.
The Commission decides, taking into account the outcome of a study and the opinion of the European Union Ecolabelling Board (EUEB), for which group of food and feed, if any, the development of EU Ecolabel criteria is feasible.
Development and revision of EU Ecolabel criteria
The EUEB may initiate and lead the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria. In this regard, consortiums consisting of more than one interest group are favoured.
The party which initiates and leads the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria produces the following documents:
a preliminary report;
a proposal for draft criteria;
a technical report in support of the proposal for draft criteria;
a final report;
a manual for potential users of the EU Ecolabel and competent bodies;
a manual for authorities awarding public contracts.
The Commission decides, taking into account the outcome of the study and the opinion of the EUEB, for which group of food and feed, if any, the development of EU Ecolabel criteria is feasible.
Award of the EU Ecolabel and terms and conditions of its use
The EU Ecolabel may be awarded by a competent body to a product or service only if it complies with the relevant EU Ecolabel criteria and the assessment requirements.
To be awarded the EU Ecolabel, the product or service must first be registered. The competent body may reject the application if the operator fails to complete the documentation within 6 months after such notification.
If the product complies with the EU Ecolabel criteria and the assessment requirements, the competent body shall assign a registration number to the product. The operator may place the EU Ecolabel on the product only after conclusion of the contract.
The EU Ecolabel may be used on the products for which the EU Ecolabel has been awarded and on their associated promotional material.
The right to use the EU Ecolabel does not extend to the use of the EU Ecolabel as a component of a trademark.
Market surveillance and control of the use of the EU Ecolabel
The competent body shall, as appropriate, undertake on-site verifications or assign an authorised agent for that purpose.
The user of the EU Ecolabel shall allow the competent body which has awarded the EU Ecolabel to the product to undertake all necessary investigations to monitor its on-going compliance with the product group criteria and Article 9.
Where, after giving the user of the EU Ecolabel the opportunity to submit observations, any competent body finds that a product bearing the EU Ecolabel does not comply with the relevant product group criteria or that the EU Ecolabel is not used in accordance with Article 9, it shall either prohibit the use of the EU Ecolabel on that product, or, in the event that the EU Ecolabel has been awarded by another competent body, it shall inform that competent body.
The competent body shall without delay inform all other competent bodies and the Commission of that prohibition.
Ecolabelling schemes in the Member States
In order to harmonise the criteria of European ecolabelling schemes (EN ISO 14024 type I), EU Ecolabel criteria shall also take into account existing criteria developed in officially recognised ecolabelling schemes in the Member States.
Promotion of the EU Ecolabel
The Commission shall promote the EU Ecolabel via the EU Ecolabel website providing basic information and promotional materials on the EU Ecolabel, and information on where to purchase EU Ecolabel products, in all EU languages.
Exchange of information and experiences
In order to foster consistent implementation of this Regulation, competent bodies shall regularly exchange information and experiences, in particular on the application of Articles 9 and 10.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 3 July 2013.
BACKGROUND
The EU Ecolabel scheme was first established in 1992. In 2009, the Commission launched a public consultation on the EU Ecolabel scheme and on the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.
In 2011, the Commission adopted a communication on a Roadmap for Sustainable Chemicals and a legislative proposal on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) amendment regulation.
The aim of the amendment was to address the lack of information on the risks of certain substances, to improve the functioning of the authorisation and restriction processes, and to ensure a better functioning of the process of authorisation and restriction of certain substances. It was also intended to improve the functioning of the process of registration of substances and the evaluation of their effects on human health and the environment.
