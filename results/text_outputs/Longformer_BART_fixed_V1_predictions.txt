Importation of goods from non-EU countries to the EU: rules on the investigation and enforcement of duties
Imports of goods to the European Union (EU) — rules on investigations and enforcement
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on the implementation of measures to combat cross-border trade in goods
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that EU countries’ imports of goods are subject to an effective and proportionate level of import duties.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC, No 1223/2009.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to goods imported from:
the EU’s single market economy;
the market economy third country;
third countries of the Western Balkan countries;
non-euro area countries.
Importers’ rights
EU countries must ensure that the import of goods is subject to a duty on the value added tax (VAT) calculated on the basis of the value of the goods imported. This value must be based on representative sales in the ordinary course of trade in the exporting country. It must be calculated in accordance with the customs duties applicable to imports from the importing country.
Duty:
provisional and definitive duties
Provisional duties may be imposed on imports of the product concerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the regulation.
Defensive duties may not apply to imports of products manufactured by companies listed in Annex I of the regulation, as amended by Regulation (EU, EC, EC) No 1101/2013 (see summary).
Duties
The Commission may also impose definitive duties on imports from third countries if it considers that the goods are likely to pose a threat to public health, public security, public order or the environment.
The investigation procedure
An investigation into an import is carried out by the Commission. The investigation is open to all interested parties, including the companies involved in the import. The Commission decides on the outcome of the investigation on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including:
exchange of information,
the economic situation of the importing and exporting countries,
exports and exports of the products concerned,
customs procedures,
trade in goods and services between the exporting and importing countries, and
the level of protection of intellectual property rights.
If the Commission concludes that a product is likely to present a risk to public security or public order, it may impose import duties on the import or export of that product. It may also decide to impose import taxes on the export of the same product to the exporting or importing country, depending on the circumstances of the case.
Expiry of import duty
A decision to terminate the investigation may be terminated by the European Commission on the grounds that the investigation has not yielded a satisfactory result.
Reviews and refunds
An EU country may request a review or a refund of the import duties it has imposed. The review or refund must be carried out within 9 months of the conclusion of an investigation.
In addition, the Commission may review or issue a refund to the importing or exporting country in the case of a failure to comply with the conditions laid down in the investigation. The European Commission may issue a decision to suspend the importation of a product or to suspend its export for a period longer than 9 months.

It applies to the importation, export performance and use of imported goods by EU countries or exporters.
Importers and importers must inform the European Commission of any subsidies they have received.
The Commission may launch an investigation to determine whether these subsidies or injury have been caused by the import of goods. The investigation must cover both subsidisation* and injury. It must be launched within 60 days of receiving a request for information from an interested party. The Commission may decide to open an investigation if it considers that there has been a substantial increase in the level of subsidies and/injury caused by these subsidies.
In the event of an increase in imports, the Commission may impose provisional duties on the imports. The provisional duties must be imposed no earlier than 60 days from the initiation of the proceedings but no later than 9 months from the end of the investigation.
Where the Commission considers that an importation or export performance has been affected by a subsidisation or injury, it may impose a provisional duty on the import or export of the imported goods. It may also impose a duty on imports of the goods if there is a significant increase in export performance.
Provisional duties may be imposed on imports if there are significant increases in the export performance or use of imports.
EU countries and exporters must not seek or accept from the Commission any subsidy or injury resulting from imports of their goods. They must instead inform the Commission of the reasons for this decision.
If the Commission concludes that there is no evidence of a subsidy or an injury, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the facts available.

Reporting of breaches of EU law: protection of whistle-blowers (Directive 2018/852/EU)
Reporting breaches of Union law: protecting whistleblowers
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2018/884 on the protection of whistleblowers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure that persons reporting to institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the EU benefit from the same level of protection as those reporting to the European Commission.
It sets out minimum standards of protection for those who report breaches of European Union law that are harmful to the public interest.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to all persons who report to the EU institutions or bodies. It does not apply to third parties, such as external reporting platform providers, external counsel, auditors, trade union representatives or employees’ representatives.
EU institutions and bodies must ensure that those who make a public disclosure of a breach are protected against any form of retaliation. This includes:
public disclosure in cases where, despite internal and external reporting, the breach remains unaddressed, for instance if the breach was not appropriately assessed or investigated, or no appropriate remedial action was taken.
Public disclosure in the event of a serious breach of the law:
the disclosure must be made by a person who is well placed to report directly to the organisational head of the organisation concerned. In smaller entities, this function could be a dual function held by a company officer well placed by a chief compliance or human resources officer, an integrity officer, a legal or privacy officer or a chief audit executive, a chief financial officer, or a member of the board of directors.
The disclosure must also be made to a third party. Such third parties could be external reporting platforms providers, outside the organisation’s internal reporting channels and procedures.
Reporting to external reporting channels: the disclosure must not affect such external channels or procedures, where they exist, but should ensure that the same minimum standards are applied throughout the EU. The directive does not affect internal reporting systems and procedures that exist.
Persons making public disclosure should qualify for protection in the case of:
a breach that is harmful to public interest;
the breach is not properly assessed and investigated;
there is no action taken to remediate the breach;
an internal or external reporting channel or procedure exists that does not adequately assess or investigate the breach.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
From 1 January 2019.
BACKGROUND
   
The European Commission has published a report on the implementation of the directive.
For more information, see:
‘Reporting of EU breaches of law’ on the Commission's website.
* KEY TERMS
* ‘Whistleblower’: an individual or group of individuals or groups of individuals who, through their reporting, expose and prevent breaches of the laws of the Union and who have a key role in exposing and preventing such breaches and in safeguarding the welfare of society.

It sets out the EU’s strategy for the European Union (EU).
It aims to transform the EU into a climate-neutral society by 2050.
KEY POINTS
The EU is the only transport mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990. This has been achieved mainly thanks to the employees who have continued working under difficult and uncertain conditions. However, the situation in rural areas and in remote and rural areas means that the networks that guarantee the provision of basic services to the population are often fewer in number and less well-developed. This is why the EU needs to modernise and modernise its rail system.
The European Green deal is a new growth strategy that aims to tackle climate change by 2050, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. It also aims to ensure that the EU is a climate neutral society by 2030.
Railways are a key element of this strategy. They contribute to the growth of the EU economy and to the sustainable development of the economy. They are also a major source of jobs and economic activity, as they provide the means of transport for many of the most deprived people in the EU.
However, the EU, as well as the transport sector, which is one of the main sources of income and employment in the country. The EU. This means that it is important for the development of economic growth and jobs in the rural areas, which are often excluded from the EU budget.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the rail system and to reduce its carbon emissions and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. To this end, the European Commission has adopted the European Year for Railways (Euratom 2020).
The year 2021 will represent the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the Union, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services, on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the Union and on providing the European EU Agency for Railwayways (ERA) with additional tasks that aim to lower technical barriers.
By 31 March 2021, the Commission will inform the European Parliament and the Council of its plans for the implementation of the European year.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The decision applies from 1 January 2021.
BACKGROUND
 
The 2020 EU Green Deal is part of the broader European growth strategy, which also includes the European 2020 Agenda for Europe (see summary) and the European Climate Action Plan.
For more information, see:
EU Green Deal (European Commission).

The regulation applies to all fishing vessels flying the flag of the European Union (EU).
Purse seine vessels flying EU flag are prohibited from fishing in:
the overlap area;
the 4°S area; and
the 50°W area.
EU countries must notify the International Association for the Conservation of Tropical Tunas (IATTC) and the World Conservation Council (WCPFC) prior to fishing in these areas. The IATTC Secretariat forwards the information to the Commission by 30 June.
Before fishing in this area, flag EU countries must inform the WCPFC and the ICTC under which of the two conservation and measures adopted by those organisations the vessels flying their flag shall operate when fishing in that overlap area. The Commission then forwards that information to its Secretariat, which forwards it to the International Commission for the Protection of Marine Living Resources (ICPHR).
If a country considers that a vessel flying its flag is fishing in an area covered by the ICTY, it must suspend its fishing activities in that area until the end of the closure period for that fishing activity.
In the event that a whale shark is deliberately encircled in the purse seine net, the master of the vessel must ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure its safe release; and report the incident to the EU country, including the number of individuals concerned, details of how and why the encirclement happened, where it occurred, and an assessment of the life status of the animal(s) on release (including whether any were released alive but subsequently died). The vessel’s refrigeration equipment in the sealed well must be rendered inoperative.
If silky sharks are unintentionally caught and frozen as part of a purse-seine vessel operation, and if the governmental authorities are present at the point of landing, the whole silky shark must be surrendered to them.
Fishing on data buoys
Data buoys must be used only for the purpose of collecting, analysing and disseminating information on marine life. They must not be used for commercial purposes.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND THE AGREEMENT?
The regulation establishes a stabilising mechanism for the import of bananas into the EU from non-EU countries.
The agreement establishes a mechanism to ensure that the EU’s imports of bananas do not adversely affect the situation of the market for the agricultural products covered by this regulation.
It sets out the conditions under which the Commission may adopt definitive safeguard measures.
KEY POINTS
Stabilisation measures
The Commission must take into account:
the impact of the imports on the situation in the EU for bananas;
the level of imports and the impact of those measures on the market.

Implementing measures must be based on the following:
a risk assessment of the import and export situation;
an analysis of the potential impact on the supply and demand for bananas and on the competitiveness of the sector;
a review of the conditions for the implementation of the measures; and
an evaluation of the risks to the supply of bananas.
If the Commission considers that the import or export situation does not meet the conditions laid down in the annex to the regulation, it must take the necessary measures to prevent or reduce the risk of a significant increase in imports.
In the case of an increase in the import, the Commission must notify all interested parties of any such extension and explain the reasons therefor. The Commission must also notify the Association Committee for examination of the case.
Where the Commission does not consider that the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) are met, it may refer the matter to the Committee for Examination in accordance with Article 116 of the Agreements.
Actions taken by the Commission
If an import is likely to have an adverse effect on the production or export of bananas, the European Commission must:
take measures to limit or eliminate the risk to the production and export of the products concerned;
implement definitive safeguard* measures;
inform the Committee of all the relevant parties, including the Commission, of any measures taken to prevent, reduce or eliminate imports of the goods concerned.
Information sharing
The EU must ensure that:

EU rules governing the issuing and circulation of euro and euro cent coins and collecting of euro collector coins
SUMMARY OF:
Council Regulation (EU) No 1074/2012 on the issuance and circulation rules for euro coins
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for issuing and circulating euro coins.
It aims to ensure that euro coins are legal tender throughout the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to coins denominated in euro, euro cent and cent and complying with the denominations and technical specifications laid down by the Council. It does not apply to coins issued by the European Central Bank (ECB).
Issuance of circulation coins
EU countries must issue euro coins at face value. These coins must be legal tender in the issuing EU country.
Collector coins
Collectors’ coins must have the status of legal tender only in the country in which they are minted. They must not be used as a means of payment in any EU country other than the issuing country’s national currency.
The European Commission must conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1- and 2-cent coins. The Commission may decide whether to issue commemorative coins with a common design collectively issued by all EU countries whose currency is the euro. The decision to issue such coins is taken by Council.
EU Member States must take all appropriate measures to discourage the use of collector coins as payment.
Exemptions from the regulation
The Commission may exempt from the obligation to issue collector coins if they are:
issued by a Member State that is not an issuing Member State;
not issued by an EU country that is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA);
issued in circulation by a non-EU Member State which is a contracting Member State (non-ECB Member State).
Exclusions from the scope of the regulation:
collector coins are exempt from circulation rules when they are issued in the territory of an EU Member State other than that of the issuing State.
Member States must ensure that they do not use collector coins for the purposes of payment of goods and services other than those for which they have the legal tender status;
collectors must not use them as payment for goods or services that are not legal tender;
the Commission may, however, decide to exempt collector coins from the circulation rules if it considers that they are not being used for the purpose of payment by the issuing Member States.
In addition, Member States may exclude from circulation circulation coins that are issued by a State that has not been a contracting State, such as Denmark, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (1) from the list of Member States that are issuing euro coins, provided that they comply with the rules laid down in the regulation.
Implementing Regulation
The implementing regulation sets out rules for the issuance of euro circulation coins. It sets out:
the volume of coins to be issued and put into circulation;
conformity with the requirements of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU;
circulation coins must comply with certain technical specifications;
exemptions must be limited to 1-euro coins, 1-second coins, 2-second and 3-second coin coins, and 1-cent coin coins;
consultation must take place between the European Commission and the national central banks of the participating Member States on the issue and circulation limits.
Conformity must also be ensured with regard to the issue of commemorative euro coins: the Commission must determine whether these should be issued collectively or individually by the Member States, and whether they should be made available to the general public.
Consultation and impact assessment
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the single currency, the Commission will conduct a communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this regulation. It will also present a report on the impact on the economy and the financial system of the decision-making process in the event of a change in the composition of the monetary base.

The Commission decides, taking into account the outcome of this study and the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (EFSC), which advises the Commission on developing and revising the criteria, on the basis of the findings of the EFSA study. The Commission then forwards the results to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Environment Agency (Euratom).

Protection of patents and related patents in the European Union (EU) — codification of Regulation (EC) No 552/2009
Protection and related patent certificates in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2009/33/EC on the protection of patents
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
It codifies and repeals Directive 2001/83/EC (see summary).
It aims to ensure that patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) are protected by a European patent.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to patents granted in accordance with the EU’s general patent law. It does not apply to:
patents granted by EU countries’ national patent offices;
powers conferred on the EPO by international organisations, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WTO) or the European Research Council (ERC);
presents patents to the European Commission.
It does not cover:
the protection granted to the holder of the basic patent or his successor in title;
the patent covered by the certificate.
The duration of the protection granted by a patent must be such as to provide adequate effective protection. It must not exceed 5 years.
Duration of the certificate
The certificate must be valid for a period of 5 years from the date on which it is granted. It may be renewed if the patent holder surrenders it or if the product covered by it no longer meets the conditions laid down in the regulation.
Application for a patent law
An application must be submitted to the EPO for a certificate by a research centre located in one of the EU countries. The applicant must be able to demonstrate that:
a patent is essential for the development of a new product;
a product is likely to have a significant impact on the environment or human health;
an application for the certificate concerns a product that could have a major impact on human health or the environment.
Applying for a CE marking
The applicant must submit an application to the authority responsible for issuing the CE marking. The authority decides whether to grant the certificate or to reject it if the application or the product to which it relates does not meet the conditions set out in this regulation. The decision is binding on all EU countries and applies to certificates granted before 1 January 1995.
Procedure for granting a certificate
A certificate is granted to a patent holder for the purpose of:
protecting the intellectual property rights of a person, organisation or business;
providing a legal basis for research, development and testing of products;
promoting the development and commercialisation of products covered by a certificate;
ensuring that the certificate is valid for at least 5 years after the end of the 5-year period of protection.
Expiry of the patent
The validity of a patent may be terminated at any time by the holder if:
it is no longer in use;
it has not been commercially viable; or
the product no longer satisfies the conditions of the regulation;
or
the holder has not paid the annual fee.
