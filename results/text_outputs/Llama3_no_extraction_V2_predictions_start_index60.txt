 European Solidarity Corps Programme
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/888 establishing the European Solidarity Corps Programme and repealing Regulations (EU) 2018/1475 and (EU) No 375/2014
WHAT IS THE REGULATION DOING?
              
It establishes the European Solidarity Corps Programme (the Programme), which is designed to open up new opportunities for young people to undertake volunteering activities in solidarity-related areas, as well as to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own initiative.
It repeals Regulations (EU) 2018/1475 and (EU) No 375/2014.
KEY POINTS
The Programme aims to provide young people with more and better opportunities for solidarity activities across the European Union (EU) and beyond.
The Programme is built on the strengths and synergies of previous and existing programmes, in particular the European Voluntary Service, established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013, and the EU Aid Volunteers initiative, established by Regulation (EU) No 375/2014.
The Programme is designed to open up new opportunities for young people to undertake volunteering activities in solidarity-related areas, as well as to devise and develop solidarity projects based on their own initiative.
The Programme offers young people the opportunity to express their commitment to benefitting communities while acquiring useful experience, knowledge, skills and competences for their personal, educational, social, civic and professional development, thereby improving their employability.
The Programme also supports networking activities for participants and participating organisations and measures to ensure the quality of the supported activities and to enhance the validation of the learning outcomes of participants.
The Programme provides a single entry point for solidarity activities throughout the EU and beyond.
The Programme is designed to respond to unmet societal needs and contribute to strengthening communities and civic participation. The Programme also aims to contribute to European cooperation relevant to young people and to raising awareness of its positive impact.
Solidarity activities offered to young people should allow for concrete and beneficial contributions of young people. Solidarity activities should respond to unmet societal needs and contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the EU humanitarian aid, in line with the Good Humanitarian Donorship principles.

European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) for the period of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.
It lays down the objectives of the EGF, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding, including applications by the Member States for financial contributions from the EGF for measures targeting the beneficiaries referred to in Article 6.
KEY POINTS
The EGF shall support socioeconomic transformations that are the result of globalisation and of technological and environmental changes by helping displaced workers and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased to adapt to structural change. The EGF shall constitute an emergency fund that operates reactively. As such, the EGF shall contribute to the implementation of the principles set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights and shall enhance social and economic cohesion among regions and Member States.
The objectives of the EGF are to demonstrate solidarity and promote decent and sustainable employment in the Union by offering assistance in the case of major restructuring events, in particular those caused by challenges related to globalisation, such as changes in world trade patterns, trade disputes, significant changes in the trade relations of the Union or the composition of the internal market and financial or economic crises, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy, or as a consequence of digitisation or automation. The EGF shall support beneficiaries in returning to decent and sustainable employment as soon as possible. Particular emphasis shall be placed on measures that help the most disadvantaged groups.
The EGF shall support workers who lose their jobs in large-scale restructuring events and to help them to find other jobs as quickly as possible. The Union shall continue to provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment of displaced workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets suffering a shock of serious economic disruption.
The EGF shall be mobilised in cases where a major restructuring event has a significant impact on the local or regional economy. Such an impact shall be determined by reference to a minimum number of job displacements within a specific reference period. Considering that waves of dismissals in different sectors within the same region have an equally significant impact on the local labour market, regional applications shall also be possible. In small labour markets, such as in small Member States or remote regions, including the outermost regions as referred in Article 349 TFEU, or in exceptional circumstances, it shall be possible for applications to be submitted in cases with a lower number of job displacements. In general, Member States shall not submit their applications for EGF assistance later than 12 weeks after the end of the reference period. However, in order to prevent a funding gap due to the fact that this Regulation will enter into force after 1 January 2021 and in order to provide legal certainty, that time limit shall be suspended between 1 January 2021 and the entry into force of this Regulation.
The EGF shall primarily direct financial contributions towards active labour market policy measures and personalised services that aim to reintegrate beneficiaries rapidly into decent and sustainable employment within or outside their initial sector of activity, while preparing them for a greener and more digital European economy. The support shall also seek to promote self-employment and enterprise creation, including through the establishment of cooperatives. Measures shall reflect the prospective needs of the local or regional labour market. However, where relevant, the mobility of displaced workers shall also be supported in order to help them find new employment elsewhere. There shall be a particular focus on the dissemination of skills required in the digital age and on overcoming gender stereotypes in employment, where appropriate. The inclusion of pecuniary allowances in coordinated packages of personalised services shall be restricted. The measures supported by the EGF shall not replace passive social protection measures. Employers could be encouraged to participate in the national co-funding for the EGF-supported measures in addition to the measures which they are required to provide by virtue of national law or collective agreements.

 effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
The euro area countries have a particular interest in and a responsibility to conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union and to avoid policies that jeopardise that functioning.
The euro area countries have a particular interest in and a responsibility to conduct economic policies that promote the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union and to avoid policies that jeopardise that functioning.
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area which go beyond the provisions applicable to all EU countries, for the purpose of ensuring the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union.

Experience gained and mistakes made during the first decade of the economic and monetary union show a need for improved economic governance in the EU, which should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework at the level of the EU for the surveillance of national economic policies.
Experience gained and mistakes made during the first decade of the economic and monetary union show a need for improved economic governance in the EU, which should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework at the level of the EU for the surveillance of national economic policies.
The improved economic governance framework should rely on several interlinked and coherent policies for sustainable growth and jobs, in particular a Union strategy for growth and jobs, with particular focus on developing and strengthening the internal market, fostering international trade and competitiveness, a European Semester for strengthened coordination of economic and budgetary policies, an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive government deficits (the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)), a robust framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks, and enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, including macroprudential supervision by the European Systemic Risk Board.

Summary 73:
 EU rules on the internal market for electricity
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It sets out rules for the EU's internal electricity market, which was established in 1996. The aim of this market is to deliver real choice for all EU citizens, new business opportunities, competitive prices, efficient investment signals and higher standards of service, as well as security of supply and sustainability.
KEY POINTS
The internal electricity market
The internal electricity market is based on the principles of free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. These freedoms are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers.
The internal market is governed by common rules for the production, supply and distribution of electricity.
The market rules allow for the entry and exit of producers and suppliers based on their assessment of the economic and financial viability of their operations.
Member States retain the right to impose public service obligations in the general economic interest, in accordance with Article 106 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular where supply is severely constrained, causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal, or in the event of a market failure where interventions by regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven to be ineffective.
Member States must ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electricity as regards market entry, operation and exit.
The internal market is supported by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG).
Access to the market
The internal market for electricity has been progressively implemented throughout the EU since 1999. It is organised through a competitive electricity market across country borders.
The EU’s energy system is in the middle of a profound change. The common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants. Technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation. There is a need to adapt the EU market rules to a new market reality.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, in pursuit of the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement.
It sets a binding target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030.
KEY POINTS
Climate neutrality
The EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals regulated in EU law must be balanced within the EU by 2050, thus reducing emissions to net zero by that date, and the EU shall aim to achieve negative emissions thereafter.
The relevant EU institutions and the EU Member States must take the necessary measures at EU and national level, respectively, to enable the collective achievement of the climate-neutrality objective set out in the regulation, taking into account the importance of promoting both fairness and solidarity among Member States and cost-effectiveness in achieving this objective.
Scientific advice on climate change
The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (the Advisory Board) established under Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 serves as a point of reference for the EU on scientific knowledge relating to climate change by virtue of its independence and scientific and technical expertise.
The Advisory Board provides scientific advice and issues reports on existing and proposed EU measures, climate targets and indicative greenhouse gas budgets, and their coherence with the objectives of the regulation and the EU’s international commitments under the Paris Agreement.
The Advisory Board identifies actions and opportunities needed to successfully achieve the EU climate targets and raises awareness on climate change and its impacts, as well as stimulating dialogue and cooperation between scientific bodies within the EU.
The Advisory Board is guided in its work by the best available and most recent scientific evidence, including the latest reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
EU 2030 climate target
The regulation sets a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030.
The regulation also amends Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, which establishes a governance framework for the Energy Union, in order to include the climate-neutrality objective in the relevant provisions of that regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 16 August 2021.
WHAT IS THE REGULATION FOR?
              
It aims to ensure that the EU and its Member States remain on track to achieve the climate-neutrality objective and progress on adaptation.
KEY TERMS

It amends Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
KEY POINTS
Subject matter and scope
The regulation applies to:
Union fishing vessels, and Union vessels engaged in recreational fishing, which:
catch Mediterranean swordfish;
tranship or carry on board, including outside the ICCAT Convention area, Mediterranean swordfish;
third country fishing vessels, and third country vessels engaged in recreational fisheries, which operate in Union waters and which catch Mediterranean swordfish;
third country vessels which are inspected in Member States ports and which carry on board Mediterranean swordfish or fishery products originating from Mediterranean swordfish that have not been previously landed or transhipped at ports.
Management measures
Each Member State takes the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of fishing vessels flying its flag is commensurate with the fishing opportunities for Mediterranean swordfish available to that Member State.
Each Member State allocates fishing opportunities for Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
Member States limit the number of fishing vessels flying their flag and authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish to the average yearly number of vessels flying their flag that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed Mediterranean swordfish during the period 2013-2016.
Each Member State submits its annual fishing plans to the Commission by 1 March of each year. Such annual fishing plans shall include detailed information regarding the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated by fishing gear type, including quota allocated to recreational fisheries, where relevant, and to by-catches.
Technical conservation measures
Mediterranean swordfish shall not be caught, either as targeted species or as by-catch, retained on board, transhipped or landed during the closure period. The closure period shall be from 1 January to 31 March of each year.
By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it shall be prohibited to catch, retain on board, tranship, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale Mediterranean swordfish, including in recreational fisheries:
measuring less than 100 cm lower jaw to fork length (LJFL); or
weighing less than 11,4 kg of live weight, or 10,2 kg of gilled and gutted weight.
Only entire specimens of Mediterranean swordfish, without removal of any external part, or gilled and gutted specimens, may be retained on board, transhipped landed or carried in the first transport after landing.
Notwithstanding Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish may retain on board, tranship, transfer, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale incidental catches of Mediterranean swordfish below the minimum conservation reference size, provided such catches do not exceed 5 % by weight or number of specimens of the total Mediterranean swordfish catch of the fishing vessels concerned.
By-catches of Mediterranean swordfish shall not exceed at any time following a fishing operation the by-catch limit that Member States establish in their annual fishing plans for the total catch on board by weight or number of specimens.
Where the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated to the flag Member State is exhausted, any Mediterranean swordfish caught alive shall be released.
The maximum number of hooks that may be set by or carried on board fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish shall be fixed at 2 500 hooks.
The hook size shall not be smaller than 7 cm in height.
The length of the pelagic longlines shall not exceed 30 nautical miles (55,56 km).
Control measures
Member States shall issue fishing authorisations to fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish and flying their flag, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, in particular Articles 20 and 21 thereof.
Only Union vessels included in the ICCAT record of vessels, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 16 and 17, shall be allowed to target, retain on board, tranship, land, transport or process Mediterranean swordfish, without prejudice to the provisions on by-catches laid down in Article 13.
Each Member State with a quota for Mediterranean swordfish shall implement a national scientific observer programme for pelagic longline vessels flying that Member State's flag and targeting Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with this Article. The national observer programme shall comply with the minimum standards laid down in Annex I.

 European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027.
KEY POINTS
The EMFAF has a budget of EUR 6.1 billion for 7 years. It is split between shared and direct management (EUR 5.3 billion and EUR 0.8 billion respectively).
The EMFAF aims to support the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the Union’s maritime policy and the Union’s international commitments in the field of ocean governance. It is a key enabler for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood products, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans.
The EMFAF provides support for:
fostering sustainable fisheries and the restoration and conservation of aquatic biological resources;
fostering sustainable aquaculture activities, and processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products, thus contributing to food security in the Union;
enabling a sustainable blue economy in coastal, island and inland areas, and fostering the development of fishing and aquaculture communities;
strengthening international ocean governance and enabling seas and oceans to be safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed.
The EMFAF is based on 4 priorities. Member States, in their programmes, indicate the most appropriate means for achieving these priorities.
The EMFAF provides support for:
avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches and of minimising the negative impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem;
achieving a 30 % target of all expenditure under the MFF 2021-2027 spent on mainstreaming climate objectives and contributing to the ambition of providing 7.5 % of annual spending under the MFF 2021-2027 to biodiversity objectives in 2024 and 10 % of annual spending under the MFF 2021-2027 to biodiversity objectives in 2026 and 2027, while considering the existing overlaps between climate and biodiversity goals;

 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making
SUMMARY
INTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT
The European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission have agreed to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
Better law-making
The three institutions hereby agree to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
Programming
The three institutions agree to reinforce the Union's annual and multiannual programming in line with Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which entrusts the Commission with the task of initiating annual and multiannual programming.
The Commission will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council respectively, both before and after the adoption of its annual Work Programme. That dialogue will encompass the following:
early bilateral exchanges of views on initiatives for the upcoming year will take place in advance of the submission of a written contribution from the President of the Commission and its First Vice-President setting out in appropriate detail items of major political importance for the following year and containing indications with regard to intended withdrawals of Commission proposals;
following the debate on the State of the Union, and before the adoption of the Commission Work Programme, the European Parliament and the Council will have an exchange of views with the Commission on the basis of the letter of intent;
an exchange of views will take place between the three institutions on the adopted Commission Work Programme, pursuant to paragraph 7.
The Commission will duly take account of the views expressed by the European Parliament and the Council at each stage of the dialogue, including their requests for initiatives.
The Commission will provide regular updates on its planning throughout the year and give reasons for any delay in the presentation of the proposals included in its Work Programme. The Commission will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of its Work Programme for the year in question.
Impact assessment
The three institutions agree on the positive contribution of impact assessments in improving the quality of Union legislation.
The Commission will carry out impact assessments of its legislative and non-legislative initiatives, delegated acts and implementing measures which are expected to have significant economic, environmental or social impacts.
The Commission's impact assessment and any additional impact assessment work conducted during the legislative process by the Institutions will be made public by the end of the legislative process and, taken together, can be used as the basis for evaluation.
Public and stakeholder consultation and feedback
The Commission will, before adopting a proposal, conduct public consultations in an open and transparent way, ensuring that the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation.
Ex-post evaluation of existing legislation
The three institutions confirm the importance of the greatest possible consistency and coherence in organising their work to evaluate the performance of Union legislation, including related public and stakeholder consultations.
The Commission will inform the European Parliament and the Council of its multiannual planning of evaluations of existing legislation and will, to the extent possible, include in that planning their requests for in-depth evaluation of specific policy areas or legal acts.
Legislative instruments
The Commission shall provide, in relation to each proposal, an explanation and justification to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding its choice of legal basis and type of legal act in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal.
The Commission shall also explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in the light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and how they are compatible with fundamental rights.
Delegated and implementing acts
The three institutions underline the important role played by delegated and implementing acts in Union law. Used in an efficient, transparent manner and in justified cases, they are an integral tool for better law-making, contributing to simple, up-to-date legislation and its efficient, swift implementation. It is the competence of the legislator to decide whether and to what extent to use delegated or implementing acts, within the limits of the Treaties.
The three institutions have agreed on a Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and on the related standard clauses (the Common Understanding), annexed hereto. In accordance with the Common Understanding and with a view to enhancing transparency and consultation, the Commission commits to gathering, prior to the adoption of delegated acts, all necessary expertise, including through the consultation of Member States' experts and through public consultations.
The Commission may be invited to meetings in the European Parliament or the Council in order to have a further exchange of views on the preparation of delegated acts.
The three institutions will enter into negotiations without undue delay after the entry into force of this Agreement, with a view to supplementing the Common Understanding by providing for non-binding criteria for the application of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The three institutions agree to refrain from adding, in Union legislation, procedural requirements which would alter the mechanisms for control set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Transparency and coordination of the legislative process
The three institutions acknowledge that the ordinary legislative procedure has developed on the basis of regular contacts at all stages of the procedure. They remain committed to further improving the work done under the ordinary legislative procedure in line with the principles of sincere cooperation, transparency, accountability and efficiency.
The three institutions will keep each other regularly informed throughout the legislative process about their work, about on-going negotiations among them and about any stakeholder feedback that they may receive, via appropriate procedures, including dialogue between them.
The three institutions will facilitate mutual exchange of views and information, including by inviting representatives of the other institutions to informal exchanges of views on a regular basis.
The three institutions agree that the provision of information to national Parliaments must allow the latter to exercise fully their prerogatives under the Treaties.
The three institutions will ensure the transparency of legislative procedures, on the basis of relevant legislation and case-law, including an appropriate handling of trilateral negotiations.
The three institutions undertake to meet within six months after the entry into force of this Agreement in order to negotiate improved practical arrangements for cooperation and information-sharing within the framework of the Treaties, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Implementation and application of Union legislation
The three institutions call upon the Member States, when they adopt measures to transpose or implement Union legislation or to ensure the implementation of the Union budget, to communicate clearly to their public on those measures.
The three institutions call upon the Member States to cooperate with the Commission in obtaining information and data needed to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Union law.
The Commission will continue to report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Union legislation. The Commission's report includes, where relevant, reference to the information mentioned in paragraph 43. The Commission may provide further information on the state of implementation of a given legal act.
Simplification
The three institutions confirm their commitment to using the legislative technique of recasting for the modification of existing legislation more frequently and in full respect of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts. Where recasting is not appropriate, the Commission will submit a proposal in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 –Accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts as soon as possible after the adoption of an amending act. If the Commission does not submit such a proposal, it shall state
