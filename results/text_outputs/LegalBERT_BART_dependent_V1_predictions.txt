Directive 2014/26/EU on the exercise of copyright and related rights by operators of online services that are ancillary to broadcasts
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?

Scope
The directive applies to all operators of retransmissable online services which aggregate broadcasts of television or radio programmes into packages and provide them to users simultaneously with the initial transmission of those broadcasts, unaltered and unabridged, using various techniques, such as cable, satellite, digital terrestrial, and mobile or closed circuit IP-based networks, as well as the open internet.
Ancillary online services include services that give access to material that enriches or otherwise expands the television or the radio programmes broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, including by way of previewing, extending, supplementing or reviewing the relevant programme's content.
EU countries must ensure that the operators of these services have the required rights to works and other protected subject matter for all the relevant territories, which further increases the complexity of the clearance of such rights.
Rights of broadcasting organisations
To retransmit initial transmissions of television programmes, operators must obtain an authorisation from the holders of the exclusive right of communication to the general public of works or other protected subjects.
The authorisation is valid for a period of 5 years from the date of receipt of the authorisation. The authorisation must be renewed at least once every 5 years.
Operators must also ensure that they respect the rights of the collective management organisations (collective management organisations) responsible for the distribution of the retransmitted programmes and for the collection and management of the revenues from those retransmits. They must also inform the public of the identity of the operators and of the rights they hold.
Collective Management organisations are responsible for:
collecting and managing the revenues generated by retransmitting programmes;
ensuring that the rights are exercised correctly and in a manner that is consistent with the rights covered by the directive;
monitoring the performance of the services they manage and ensuring that they comply with the directive’s requirements.

Summary 10:
Firearms and essential components — traceability of firearms and essential parts (EU directive on firearms and their essential components)
Firearm and essential elements — tracing firearms and components
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2017/849 on the tracing of firearms, essential components and ammunition
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure that EU countries’ competent authorities are able to trace the ownership, ownership and destruction of firearms*, essential components* and ammunition.
It codifies and repeals Directive 1999/47/EC.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to:
firearms designed for military use, such as the AK47 and the M16, and which are equipped to operate on the basis of selective fire, where they may be manually adjusted between automatic and semi-automatic firing modes, and are classified as category A firearms and should therefore be prohibited for civilian use.
Firearms which use rimfire percussion, including those with a calibre of.22 or smaller, should not be classified in category A unless they have been converted from automatic firearms.
EU countries may, however, authorise the acquisition and possession of firearms classified in the category A when necessary for historical, cultural, scientific, technical, educational or heritage purposes, provided that such museums and collectors demonstrate that they have taken the necessary measures to address any risks to public security or public order, including by way of proper storage.
National authorities must ensure that the firearms are marked with a clear, permanent and unique marking and registered in the data-filing systems of the EU countries and that they are destroyed after the destruction of the firearms or essential components concerned.

This regulation does not require EU countries to issue, under national law, other residence documents which fall outside the scope of EU law, for example residence cards issued to all residents on the territory regardless of the nationality. However, EU countries may require EU citizens and their family members who are not nationals of the EU to register in the relevant EU country for the purpose of verifying their identity.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
The European Commission has to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2018.
BACKGROUND
   
 
The EU has adopted a number of measures to combat fraud in the area of travel documents. These include:
Directive 2004/38/EC on travel documents (see summary);
EU rules on identity cards, residence cards and travel documents for non-national citizens;
EU guidelines on the use of biometric data for the verification of identity and residence card data.

Summary 24:
Countervailable subsidies — EU rules on trade policy
Countervailing subsidies — Union rules on Trade policy
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — countervailable subsidy
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules on the application of EU trade policy in the context of the EU’s anti-subsidy policy.
It aims to ensure that EU countries’ trade policy is based on the principle of ‘fair competition’.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down the principles and procedures for determining whether a subsidy is ‘countervailable’ (i.e. that it has caused material injury or is threatening to cause injury) and the amount of the subsidy. It also sets out the procedures for the rejection of complaints or the initiation of proceedings.
In addition, the regulation defines the conditions for the imposition of provisional and definitive duties. These are designed to protect the interests of EU countries against unfair trade practices.
Provisional and definitive measures
EU countries may impose provisional duties on imports of certain goods from non-EU countries if they believe that they have caused injury or are threatening to do so. They may also impose definitive duties if they consider that the imports have caused serious injury or threaten to cause serious injury.
Duties may also be imposed on the export of certain products to the EU.
Implementation of the regulation is governed by a number of rules, including:
provisional duties may be imposed in cases of suspected violation of the rules and in which the import of a subsidised product is likely to cause material injury;
definitive measures may be adopted in cases where there is evidence that the subsidy is causing material injury and that it threatens to cause such injury. These may be based on:
the nature of the imports;
the quantity of the goods imported; and
the type of goods imported.
Definitive and provisional duties can be imposed where:
a product is considered to be subsidised if:
it benefits from a direct or indirect subsidy;
it is imported from the country of origin but is exported from an intermediate country; or
it has been exported from the EU from an EU country other than that of origin.
A product is not considered to benefit from a subsidy if it does not:
benefit from a government guarantee, unless there is a difference between the amount that the firm receiving the guarantee pays on a loan guaranteed by the government and on a comparable commercial loan in the absence of the government guarantee.
The amount of a subsidy must be calculated according to the following criteria:
whether the subsidy has been granted specifically or not;
whether it has been made legally contingent upon export performance;
how the subsidy was granted;
if the export performance is in fact tied to actual or anticipated exportation or export earnings.
An investigation may be launched if the facts demonstrate that the grant of a government subsidy, without having been made legal contingent on export performance, is in relation to export earnings or that the granting of such a subsidy was in fact linked to export performance.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2018.
BACKGROUND
 
  * KEY TERMS
* Countervailable: a product is deemed to be ‘subsidised’ if it benefits from an ‘unlawful’ or ‘undue’ subsidy.
* Imports: imports of a product which are intended to be used for the production, export or transfer of the product, but which are not intended for that purpose.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure that highly qualified, highly skilled non-European Union citizens who are beneficiaries of international protection (i.e. those who have been granted the right to live and work freely in the EU) have the same rights and benefits as other EU citizens.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to all EU nationals who are highly qualified and who have benefited from international protection.
It does not apply to EU citizens who apply to reside in an EU country as researchers in order to carry out research projects, as they fall within the scope of Directive 2016/801 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which introduced a specific procedure for admitting non-euro area nationals for the purpose of research.
EU countries must ensure that EU blue cards are valid for at least 5 years of professional experience at a level comparable to higher education qualifications and which is relevant to the profession or sector specified in the work contract or binding job offer.
Applicants must meet the following criteria:
have a high level of professional skills, attesting that they have at least 3 years of relevant professional experience in the relevant occupation or profession and that the work is inherently regarded as requiring such skills;
have at least 2 years of work experience in a relevant profession in the employer’s territory.
have completed a minimum of 2 years’ work in the country of residence in which they live or work.
The employer must accept applications for an EU Blue Card on the basis of evidence of higher professional skills attested by at least 4 years of experience in an occupation or sector in which the work to be carried out is regarded as demanding such competence.
Employers must provide for a lower salary threshold for specific professions where the EU country concerned considers that there is a particular shortage of available workers and where such professions belong to major group 1 or 2 of the ISCO classification. The salary threshold may not be lower than the applicable salary threshold but may be higher, in line with market conditions, labour law, collective agreements and practices in the Member State concerned.
An employer may refuse to issue a blue card if the holder has not respected the conditions for mobility within the allowed period for carrying out a business activity, has not submitted an application for long-term mobility or has not used the mobility rights within the required time frame, or has used them in an abusive manner. The employer may also withdraw or refuse to renew the card if a holder has failed to comply with the requirements for mobility under this directive, including in cases of the abusive use of mobility rights, for example by:
using a mobility right that is not respected;
using an abusive mobility right which is not recognised by the employer;
not respecting the conditions of mobility; or
using mobility rights that are not respected by the holder.

Summary 49:
Harmonisation of the visa requirements for non-EU nationals
Harmonomisation of visas for non EU nationals
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 on the common policy on visas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to harmonise the requirements for EU nationals who are subject to a requirement to be in possession of a visa for the crossing of EU countries’ external borders (also referred to herein as ‘the visa requirement’) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to nationals of the EU countries of the Schengen area (non-EU countries) who do not have to carry a visa when crossing their external borders. It does not apply to EU citizens who are resident in non-Schengen countries.
EU countries may exempt certain categories of persons from the visa requirement or impose it on them in accordance with public international law or custom.
Exemptions
The list of countries on the exemption list is updated by the European Commission on a case-by-case basis.
The exemption is valid for 90 days in any 180-day period, notwithstanding the possibility of having country-specific amendments to those annexes in particular circumstances, for instance as a result of a Visa liberalisation process or as the ultimate consequence of a temporary suspension of the exemption from the exemption.
Visa-free nationals may be refused entry to the EU if:
the EU country of residence decides to make the nationals of one or more EU countries subject to an EU visa requirement; or
the list in Annex II decides that the EU country in which the exemption is granted is no longer appropriate; or does not meet the criteria for granting the exemption; or if the exemption has been granted by an EU country that is not an EU member.
Annex II also contains a list of third countries whose nationals do not require a visa to cross the EU’s external borders and those countries which do not impose a visa on their nationals when they do so.
National authorities must ensure that:
visas issued by EU countries are valid for a maximum of 90 days;
the third countries listed in Annex I do not apply a visa requirement for their nationals; and
the persons on the list do not hold a valid travel document.
If the third country in the list does not fulfil the conditions for granting a visa exemption, EU countries must inform the other EU countries and the Commission of the measures they have taken to ensure that the exemption continues to be granted.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2002.
BACKGROUND
 
  * KEY TERMS
* Visas: a visa issued by a European Union (EU) country for the purpose of allowing its nationals to cross its external borders without having to carry one.
* Non-EU country: a third country that does not require the holder of a travel document to enter its territory.

extortion;
forgery;
piracy;

cybercrime, including any offence set out in Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Penalties for the offences listed above are based on a number of factors, including:
the nature and seriousness of the offence;
the amount of the property and the nature and severity of the offences under investigation and the right to the protection of personal data.
In addition, EU countries must ensure that criminal offences are punishable by a maximum sentence of at least 5 years’ imprisonment. The maximum sentence may be increased if the offender has a prior or simultaneous conviction for that criminal activity, or if there is evidence that the offender knew that the property was the result of a criminal activity.

Summary 58:
Ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the EU by means of small consignments
Ensuing the enforceability of intellectual properties in the context of customs supervision and control
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — small consignment destruction procedure
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that EU countries’ customs authorities are able to enforce intellectual property (IP) rights by destroying goods that are suspected of infringing EU laws.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to goods that:
have been manufactured by a person duly authorised by a right-holder to manufacture a certain quantity of goods, in excess of the quantities agreed between that person and the rightholder;
are manufactured as genuine goods and are therefore not liable to customs supervision or control;
have not been placed on the market for the first time in the European Economic Area (EEA) without the authorisation of the right-holders.
It does not apply to:
goods that have been manufactured in a non-EU country and placed on a European Union market without his or her authorisation;
materials that are manufactured in an EU country but placed on an EU market without their authorisation.
Implementation of the regulation
Customs authorities must carry out adequate customs controls to prevent the diversion of infringing goods onto the market of the EU.
The procedure is compulsory with regard to all infringements of IP rights and should be applied, where the declarant or the holder of the goods agrees to destruction.
EU countries may refuse to apply the procedure if they consider that the goods do not comply with EU law or that they would be liable under the legislation of the country where the goods were found.
In the event of a refusal to destroy the goods, the EU country in which the goods are to be destroyed must inform the customs authorities of the reason for the refusal and inform them of the reasons for the decision. The EU country which is responsible for enforcing the rights of the infringer must also inform the EU countries in which it is to be enforced.
A standard form must be provided to customs authorities when they receive a request for destruction of a consignment. The form must contain information such as:
the name and contact details of the person who authorised the manufacture of the consignment;
the date and place of entry into force of the decision and the date of destruction;
details of the date and time when the goods will be destroyed;
where the goods have been moved, under customs supervision, between different places within the EU’s customs territory, they must be moved under the supervision of the customs authority of that EU country.
An advisory procedure must be established for the adoption of the standard forms.
If a customs authority considers that the consignment does not conform with the regulation, it must take appropriate action.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2018. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 2019.
BACKGROUND
 
  * KEY TERMS
* Small consignment: a small amount of goods that can be moved by a single individual or group of persons within the customs territory of the European Union (EU).

Better law-making: EU institutions’ common approach
Better law making: EU authorities’ collective approach
SUMMARY OF:
Common Understanding between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission on Better Law-Making
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to improve cooperation between the three European Union (EU) institutions in order to improve the quality of EU legislation.
The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the EU.
KEY POINTS
The three institutions recognise the role and responsibility of national parliaments as laid down in the Treaties, in Protocol No 1 on the role of National Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and the Protocol No 2 on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
In this context, the three institutions agree to reinforce the EU’s annual and multiannual programming in line with Article 17(1) of the Treaty, which entrusts the Commission with the task of initiating EU-wide programming. The Commission will engage in a dialogue with the EU institutions both before and after the adoption of its annual work programme (known as the ‘Commission Work Programme’). The Commission Work Programme will include major legislative and non-legislative proposals for the following year, including repeals, recasts, simplifications and withdrawals.
Public consultations will be conducted in an open and transparent way, ensuring that the modalities and time limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation.
EU countries’ experts will be consulted before the Commission adopts a proposal.
Implementation of delegated acts will be based on the best available scientific and technical information.
Delegislation will be drawn up by the Commission on the basis of a proposal submitted by the EU countries.
Each institution will submit a proposal to the Commission for a vote within 6 months of adoption of the proposal. If the Commission decides not to submit the proposal in response to such a request, it will inform the institution concerned of the detailed reasons, and will provide, where appropriate, an analysis of possible alternatives and respond to any issues raised by the colegislators in relation to analyses concerning 'European added value' and concerning the "cost of non-Europe".
The European Parliament and the Council will, when they consider this to be appropriate and necessary for the legislative process, carry out impact assessments on the Commission's proposal. They will also inform the Commission of the results of these impact assessments before adopting or revising their guidelines concerning their tools for better law making (public and stakeholder consultations, impact assessments and ex-post evaluations).
The Commission will also explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in the light of the principle of subsidarity, proportionality and how they are compatible with fundamental rights.

Preservation of bank accounts and debtors’ assets in the EU (Regulation (EU) 2019/852)
Preservation OF bank accounts AND debtors' assets in EU (Recast)
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EC) No 552/2013 on the application for a Preservation Order in civil matters having cross-border implications
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the efficiency of enforcement of judgments in the European Union (EU), in particular in cases involving bank accounts.
It sets out the procedure for a creditor wishing to secure the enforcement of a later judgment on the substance of the matter prior to initiating proceedings on the matter and at any stage during such proceedings.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all EU citizens who have a bank account in another EU country.
Creditors may apply for a preservation order if:
the creditor has not yet obtained a judgment, court settlement or authentic instrument requiring the debtor to pay the creditor’s claim;
the debtor is a consumer domiciled in an EU country other than that of the EU country in which the creditor has an account or accounts maintained in that EU country, even if the creditor applies at the same time for a protection order which concerns an account and accounts maintained outside the EU.
The creditor must provide the court with all the information needed to identify the debtor's bank account before the creditor can obtain an order. The creditor must also provide proof of the initiation of the proceedings and provide proof that he lodged his application for an order within a specified period of time.
If the court considers that there is an urgent need for such account information, it must issue an order to ensure compensation to the debtor and it should be open to the court, in the absence of specific evidence as to the amount of the potential damage, to consider the amount in which an order is to be issued as a guideline for determining the security.
An order may be issued by the court of a country where the creditor is a resident and the bank account concerned is maintained in the country of domicile of the creditor. The court of that country must issue the order if it is satisfied, on the basis of the evidence submitted by the creditor, that the debtor has not complied with the conditions of the order and that the order is necessary to ensure that the payment of the judgment is made.
A court of the country which receives the order may refuse to enforce the order, unless it has the power to do so under certain conditions.
In the event of a breach of the conditions laid down in the regulation, the court in question may order the creditor to pay a fine of up to €10,000.

Protection of designations of origin and geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs (Regulation (EC) No 882/2004)
Protection OF designations OF ORIGIN AND GARESE
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — protecting designations* of origin, geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules to protect designations (designations* or geographical indications) of origin* and specialities (traditional specialities) guaranteed* in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Designations are designed to recognise the quality of products and their model of production as a factor that adds value to consumers’ health and well-being.
The regulation applies to all products produced in the EU by farmers and producers who have kept traditions alive while taking into account the developments of new production methods and material.
Protected designations must be registered on the European Commission’s register of protected designations and protected geographical indications.
Traditional specialities are protected under the regulation and are automatically included in the register.
National authorities must ensure that names of genuine traditional products are registered under the scheme, in particular those concerning the definition of ‘traditional’, which should cover products that have been produced for a significant period of time.
Registered names may be refused or, if registered, invalidated on the grounds that they conflict with a prior designation of origin or a geographical indication.
Registers must be established to ensure that the protected names are used fairly and in order to prevent practices liable to mislead consumers and to prevent the misuse, imitation and evocation of the registered names on goods as well as on services.
EU countries must ensure the protection of protected names is extended to the use of the protected name on goods and services and that the registered name is protected against counterfeiting and counterfeiting.
A register of registered names is set up for protected names. The register must contain information on:
the names of protected products;
the registered name of protected specialities;
procedures for registering protected names;
a list of the national authorities responsible for enforcing the regulation;
rules for the registration and enforcement procedures;
measures to be taken by national authorities in the event of counterfeiting or counterfeiting of protected name or protected geographical indication names.
An EU country may grant transitional protection at national level without affecting intra-EU or international trade.
Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of food and agricultural products, and in particular the provisions aimed at preventing labelling that may confuse or mislead consumers, lays down the general rules on labelling of agricultural products.

Issuing of euro coins and commemorative coins
Issuance of eurocoins and commemororative coins
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 852/2011 — the issuing of euro coin and collector coins
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the issuing and redemption of coins in the euro area by EU countries.
It aims to ensure that euro coins are issued and put into circulation at face value in all EU countries whose currency is the euro.
KEY POINTS
EU countries may issue two types of coins:
circulation coins* and
collector coins* which are intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.
Collector coins are legal tender only in the EU country of issuance and should not have a shaped edge with fine scallops or a ‘Spanish flower’ shape.
The EU countries may also issue 2-euro coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and per issuing EU country for the number of issues of such coins.
Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/849 amends the regulation to allow EU countries to issue euro collector coins with a common design collectively issued by all the EU countries that have issued euro coins. The issuances of collector coins must be accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank, rather than for each individual issue.
In order to avoid that euro circulation coins are destroyed by one EU country while there may be a need for such coins in another, EU country, EU countries must consult each other prior to the destruction of these coins and ensure that they are destroyed in accordance with the rules.

support for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI)
EEOI
The EEOI supports young people not in employment, education or training (NEET), who are unemployed or inactive, by providing them with a good-quality offer of either employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of 4 months of becoming unemployed or of leaving formal education. The EEOIs supported by the ESI is open to all EU countries and regions, including the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the European Investment Bank for Europe (EIBE), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The EOEI supports NEET by:
providing them with access to employment, training, apprenticeships and traineeships;
encouraging the participation of NEET in the social and economic policies of EU countries;
supporting the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, which provides that young persons should receive an employment, continuing education, apprenticeship and a traineeship within a 4-month period if they become unemployed or have left formal education, or if they are inactive for more than 6 months after becoming unemployed.
In addition, the EEOi supports the development of a common set of output and result indicators to measure the impact of ESF funding on the EU and its Member States’ policies and programmes. These indicators are based on:
the number of jobs created and the number of unemployed and inactive NEET;
the average number of hours worked by NEET over the previous 12 months; and
the percentage of unemployed NEET who have been unemployed for at least 6 months.
EU countries and the regions are encouraged to leverage ESF financial instruments to support, for example, students, job creation, the mobility of workers, social inclusion and social entrepreneurship.

Textile labelling and labelling of textile products — fibre composition of textile fibres and non-textile parts of animal origin (EU rules on the use of textile fibre names and related labelling, marking and analysis of fibre composition) (European Union rules on textile fibre names and the labelling or marking of fibres of non-animal origin)
Textile fibres — fibres (i.e. fibres originating from animals other than humans)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — textile fibre labelling
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for textile products with a new textile fibre name or marking to be used in the EU. It aims to improve the functioning of the EU’s internal market and to provide accurate information to consumers.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all textile products consisting of two or more components. It does not apply to customised textile products made up by self-employed tailors.
Labelling
Textiles must bear the following information on the label:
the name of the fibre;
the fibre composition;
a description of the product;
an indication of the weight of the fibres;
how the fibre is treated and how it is separated from the other fibres.
The labelling must include a description of how the fibre has been treated, separated and separated from other fibrous materials and how the fibrous material has been separated.
Manufacturers must indicate that the new textile names are used only for the purpose of identifying the new fibres, and that they are not used for other purposes. They must also indicate that they have not been used for the manufacture of other textile products.
EU countries must ensure that manufacturers, or other persons acting on their behalf, include in the technical file to be submitted with their application available scientific information concerning possible allergic reactions or other adverse effects of the new fibre on human health, including results of tests conducted to that effect in compliance with relevant EU legislation.
National authorities must apply a single agreed allowance in doubtful cases. This allowance must not exceed 0.5 % of the total fibre content of the textile product and must not be exceeded by more than 0.05 %.
In the case of binary textile fibre mixtures for which there is no uniform method of analysis at EU level, the laboratory responsible for the test should be allowed to determine the composition of such mixtures, indicating in the analysis report the method used and its degree of accuracy.
If the laboratory determines that the fibre composition is not consistent, it must inform the manufacturer and the European Commission of the reason for this.

KEY POINTS
The resolution of a failing bank is a key element of the EU’s banking union (Budapest strategy), which aims to restore trust and credibility in the banking sector. It aims to ensure that the EU has a level playing field for all banks in order to foster economic growth and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for banking services.
The regulation sets up a single resolution board, which is chaired by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and composed of representatives of the national authorities of the participating EU countries. It has the power to adopt a resolution resolution plan and to adopt the terms and conditions of the resolution process.
EU countries are required to set up a Single Resolution Fund (SRF), which is managed by the EBA and is funded by the EU countries’ national authorities. The SRM is responsible for providing the EU with the financial resources needed to fund the SRM.
A resolution plan is adopted by the national resolution authorities of each participating EU country and the European Investment Bank (EIBBanks).
The SRMoves to implement the resolution plan include:
the establishment of a resolution board and a resolution committee;
the setting up of a national resolution board;
setting up of an EU-wide resolution committee to ensure consistency in the application of resolution rules;
drawing up a resolution plan for each participating country;
establishing a resolution mechanism for each EU country.
In addition, the resolution board must:
ensure that national resolution rules, practices and approaches to burden-sharing remain national and that financial resources for funding resolution are raised and spent at national level;
apply the same principles and procedures for resolution and financial backstops in all EU countries, irrespective of whether they are national or EU-based;
act in the best interest of the public and the creditors of the failing bank;
take all necessary measures to ensure the stability of the banking system and the protection of the financial interests of all stakeholders, including the public, in the event of a bank failure.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
Directive 2014/59/EU has applied since 1 January 2019 and had to become law in the Member States by 1 January 2020.

SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for the allocation by EU countries of direct support to farmers in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Direct support is provided to farmers on the basis of a coefficient coefficient (i.e. the number of hectares of land that are eligible for direct support per hectare) of €2,000 for each hectare of land in each Member State.
Eligible areas
The regulation sets out a number of eligibility criteria, including the following:
the number of hectales of land which are eligible to receive direct support for each year;

EU-Nordic agreement on the extradition of suspects and their families
EU-Norwegian agreement onthe extradition of suspected and their family
SUMMARY OF:
Agreement between the European Union (EU) and its Member States, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Iceland on the cooperation of their judicial authorities in the execution of an arrest warrant
Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/852 on the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and the Nordic countries on the negotiation of an extradition agreement
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to ensure that the extradition system between EU countries and, on the other hand, the countries of the Nordic area is based on a mechanism of surrender.
The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the EU.
KEY POINTS
The extradition procedure between EU and Nordic countries is governed by a common extradition procedure.
EU countries have uniform extradition laws with a common concept of extradition.
Each EU country has a judicial authority which is competent to issue an extradition warrant.
An arrest warrant is issued by the judicial authority of the country in which the offence was committed. The warrant is valid for a period of 6 months and may be renewed if the offence is committed in another EU country.
A judicial authority may refuse to execute the warrant if it considers that the offence has been committed in the territory of the issuing country or in a place treated as such, or if the act was committed outside the country of issuing country and the law of the executing country does not allow prosecution for the same offences when committed outside its territory.
If the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecution or execution of a sentence, the executing judicial authority must inform the EU country which issued the warrant of the reasons for refusing to execute it.
In the event of non-execution of the warrant, EU countries may make a declaration to the other EU countries to the effect that nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions.
When an EU country receives a request for the surrender of a non-EU country’s nationals, it must send the request to the national judicial authority in the country where the requested person is resident. The judicial authority is responsible for verifying that the request is genuine and that the person has given his or her consent to be surrendered.
Where the request for surrender is not genuine, the issuing judicial authority has the right to refuse the warrant and to issue a new arrest warrant in the event that the requested persons has not given his/her consent.
FROM WHEN DOES THE AGEMENT AND DECISION APPLY?
Both decisions have applied since 1 January 2018.
BACKGROUND
   
For more information, see:
‘Arrest warrant’ on the European Commission's website.
* KEY TERMS
* Arrest warrant: an international arrest warrant issued by a country in order to arrest a person who is a national of that country and who has been convicted of a criminal offence in that country. It may be issued by any country in the world, including the EU, as long as the person is an EU national.
