 Internal Market Information System (IMI)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Internal Market Information System (IMI) which facilitates administrative cooperation between EU countries.
KEY POINTS
The IMI is a secure online platform that allows EU countries’ competent authorities to exchange information and data. It is available in all official EU languages.
The IMI is available to competent authorities of EU countries as well as the European Commission. It is designed to support the implementation of EU legislation on administrative cooperation in the internal market.
The IMI helps the competent authorities to identify their counterpart in another EU country, to manage the exchange of information and to overcome language barriers. It also allows the competent authorities to overcome language barriers by providing pre-defined and pre-translated workflows.
The Commission is responsible for the IMI’s technical management, the security of the system and the training and technical assistance to the IMI users.
The Commission is also responsible for the appointment of the national IMI coordinators, as well as for the registration of the IMI coordinators and the competent authorities in the IMI.
The IMI may be expanded in the future to new areas, where it can help to ensure effective implementation of a Union act in a cost-efficient, user-friendly way, taking account of technical feasibility and overall impact on IMI.
The IMI was first established in 2011 to facilitate the posting of workers in the internal market.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies since 5 July 2015.
BACKGROUND
The IMI was first established in 2011 to facilitate the posting of workers in the internal market. It was then expanded to support administrative cooperation in other areas of the internal market, such as consumer protection, energy and taxation.
The Commission is planning to expand the IMI to other areas, where it can help to ensure effective implementation of a Union act in a cost-efficient, user-friendly way, taking account of technical feasibility and overall impact on IMI.

 Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 on the creation of unitary patent protection
Uniform patent protection within the internal market, or at least a significant part thereof, should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It implements enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, authorised by Decision 2011/167/EU.
KEY POINTS
The unitary patent protection system is designed to facilitate access to patent protection and to make the patent system less costly and legally secure.
It is designed to cover all the participating Member States.
A European patent granted with the same set of claims in respect of all the participating Member States shall benefit from unitary effect in the participating Member States provided that its unitary effect has been registered in the Register for unitary patent protection.
A European patent with unitary effect shall have a unitary character. It shall provide uniform protection and shall have equal effect in all the participating Member States. It may only be limited, transferred or revoked, or lapse, in respect of all the participating Member States. It may be licensed in respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating Member States.
The unitary effect of a European patent shall be deemed not to have arisen to the extent that the European patent has been revoked or limited.
A European patent with unitary effect shall take effect in the participating Member States on the date of publication by the EPO of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin.
The participating Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where the unitary effect of a European patent has been registered and extends to their territory, that European patent is deemed not to have taken effect as a national patent in their territory on the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin.
The rights conferred by a European patent with unitary effect shall not extend to acts concerning a product covered by that patent which are carried out within the participating Member States in which that patent has unitary effect after that product has been placed on the market in the Union by, or with the consent of, the patent proprietor, unless there are legitimate grounds for the patent proprietor to oppose further commercialisation of the product.
A European patent with unitary effect as an object of property shall be treated in its entirety and in all the participating Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary effect and in which, according to the European Patent Register:
—
the applicant had his residence or principal place of business on the date of filing of the application for the European patent; or
—
where point (a) does not apply, the applicant had a place of business on the date of filing of the application for the European patent.
The participating Member States shall ensure compliance with this Regulation in fulfilling their international obligations undertaken in the EPC and shall cooperate to that end. To that end they shall set up a select committee of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation (hereinafter ‘Select Committee’) within the meaning of Article 145 of the EPC.
The Select Committee shall consist of the representatives of the participating Member States and a representative of the Commission as an observer, as well as alternates who will represent them in their absence. The members of the Select Committee may be assisted by advisers or experts.
The participating Member States shall ensure effective legal protection before a competent court of one or several participating Member States against the decisions of the EPO in carrying out the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.
The expenses incurred by the EPO in carrying out the additional tasks given to it, within the meaning of Article 143 of the EPC, by the participating Member States shall be covered by the fees generated by the European patents with unitary effect. Renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect and additional fees for their late payment shall be paid to the European Patent Organisation by the patent proprietor.
A European patent with unitary effect shall lapse if a renewal fee and, where applicable, any additional fee have not been paid in due time.
The level of renewal fees shall be set at a level that:
—
is equivalent to the level of the renewal fee to be paid for the average geographical coverage of current European patents;
—
reflects the renewal rate of current European patents; and
—
reflects the number of requests for unitary effect.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It entered into force on 19 December 2012.
It applies from 1 January 2014 or the date of entry into force of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (the ‘Agreement’), whichever is the later.

EU-Central America Trade Agreement (CAE) – implementing rules
SUMMARY
The EU-Central America Trade Agreement (CAE) aims to strengthen political and economic relations between the EU and Central America. The agreement sets up a free trade area, but also includes rules on trade defence measures and the environment and social aspects of trade.
The CAE provides for a bilateral safeguard clause and a stabilisation mechanism for bananas, which are implemented through this regulation.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules and procedures for the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the CAE.
KEY POINTS
The bilateral safeguard clause
The bilateral safeguard clause may be applied where imports of a product originating in Central America are imported into the EU in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the EU industry.
The safeguard measures may take one of the following forms:
—
a suspension of a further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Tariff Elimination Schedule;
—
an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of:
—
the most-favoured-nation (MFN) applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or
—
the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the Agreement.
The Commission must monitor the evolution of import statistics of bananas from Central American countries and may decide to adopt prior surveillance measures in regard to imports from a Central American country where:
—
the trend in imports of a product is such that it could lead to one of the situations referred to in Articles 2 and 4; or
—
there is a surge of imports of bananas concentrated in one or several Member States, or in one or several of the EU’s outermost regions.
The Commission may adopt prior surveillance measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(2) of this regulation.
The Commission may adopt provisional safeguard measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(4) of this regulation in cases of imperative grounds of urgency, including the case referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 7 of this regulation.
The Commission may adopt definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 14(3) of this regulation where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) of this regulation are met.
The Commission may adopt prior surveillance measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(2) of this regulation where there is a surge of imports of bananas concentrated in one or several Member States, or in one or several of the EU’s outermost regions.

The Commission may adopt definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 14(3) of this regulation where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) of this regulation are met.
The duration and review of safeguard measures
A safeguard measure may be imposed only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the EU industry and to facilitate adjustment. That period may not exceed 2 years, unless it is extended under paragraph 3.
A safeguard measure may be imposed only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious deterioration in the economic situation of one or several of the EU’s outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 TFEU. That period may not exceed 2 years, unless it is extended under paragraph 3.
The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may be extended by up to 2 years provided that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to the EU industry and that there is evidence that the EU industry is adjusting.
The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed 4 years, including any provisional safeguard measure.
No safeguard measure may be applied to the import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure, unless a period of time equal to half of that during which the safeguard measure was applied for the immediately preceding period has elapsed.
The stabilisation mechanism for bananas
A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports of products falling under heading 0803 00 19 of the Combined Nomenclature (fresh bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ‘ST’ in the Tariff Elimination Schedule.
The importation of the products referred to in paragraph 1 at the preferential customs duty rate shall be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the competent authority of the Republic of the Central American country from which the products are exported.
Where the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, it may apply the lesser of the base rate of customs duty or the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken.
The measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 shall be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from the date of application of the Agreement.

KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all BIAs concluded by EU countries with non-EU countries. It does not cover agreements concluded between EU countries.
BIAs
A BIA is an agreement between an EU country and a non-EU country that contains provisions on investment protection. This regulation covers only those provisions of BIAs dealing with investment protection.
BIAs that EU countries sign before 1 December 2009 or before the date of their accession to the EU, whichever is later, may be maintained in force or enter into force, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and this regulation.
EU countries may be authorised to amend or conclude BIAs with non-EU countries, provided that they comply with certain conditions.
EU countries must take the necessary measures to eliminate any incompatibilities with EU law contained in BIAs concluded between them and non-EU countries.
The European Commission may assess BIAs notified by EU countries under this regulation to evaluate whether one or more of their provisions constitute a serious obstacle to the negotiation or conclusion by the EU of BIAs with non-EU countries.
The Commission may request additional information from the EU country concerned to carry out its assessment.
If the Commission establishes that one or more of the provisions of a BIA constitute a serious obstacle to the negotiation or conclusion by the EU of BIAs with non-EU countries, the Commission and the EU country concerned must enter into consultations.
The Commission may, within 60 days of the end of the consultations, indicate the appropriate measures to be taken by the EU country concerned in order to remove the obstacles.

Summary 103:
 EU trade preferences for developing countries
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) offers special trade preferences to developing countries. These preferences are designed to support their economic development and help them to fight poverty.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the conditions under which developing countries can benefit from the EU’s special trade preferences.
KEY POINTS
The special trade preferences are based on the following arrangements:
the generalised system of preferences (GSP) for developing countries;
the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change;
the special arrangement for the least developed countries (LDC);
the special arrangement for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states.
The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country has ratified and effectively implements a minimum number of relevant international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance;
the country has ratified and effectively implements the relevant conventions’ reporting obligations and conclusions and recommendations of the relevant monitoring bodies;
the country has effectively implemented its binding undertakings as referred to in the relevant conventions;
the country has not formulated any reservation which is prohibited by any of the relevant conventions or which is incompatible with the object and purpose of that convention.
The special arrangement for the least developed countries (LDC) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is a least-developed country according to the United Nations classification;
the country’s per capita income is below the threshold set by the World Bank;
the country’s level of diversification is low, as measured by the vulnerability threshold;
the country’s economy is not able to sustain the higher level of diversification that the scheme would allow.
The special arrangement for the ACP states is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is an ACP country;
the country is not eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+).
The generalised system of preferences (GSP) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is not eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+).
The regulation applies to all products except for agricultural products listed in Annex I.
The scheme is based on the following principles:
graduation, which means that if a country meets the conditions to be eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+), it will benefit from the additional tariff preferences. Graduation will take effect 5 years after the date of application of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+);
temporary withdrawal of the arrangements from certain countries, in cases where the country concerned has not fulfilled its binding undertakings as referred to in the relevant conventions or has formulated a reservation which is prohibited by any of the relevant conventions or which is incompatible with the object and purpose of that convention;
safeguard measures, in cases where the scheme may have a negative impact on the production of certain products in the EU.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The EU’s trade preferences for developing countries are intended to support their economic development and help them to fight poverty.
The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) is a new arrangement which has been designed to support the development of the world’s most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change.
The special arrangement for the least developed countries (LDC) is designed to support the world’s poorest countries in their efforts to improve their economies.
The special arrangement for the ACP states is a continuation of the arrangements set out in the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement.
The generalised system of preferences (GSP) is a long-standing arrangement which has been in place since 1971.
For further information, please see the European Commission’s website on trade preferences.

Summary 108:
 double hulls for oil tankers
SUMMARY
EU legislation aims to ensure that oil tankers entering into ports and offshore terminals or anchoring in an area under the jurisdiction of Member States comply with the double hull design requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78).
WHAT INFORMATION DOES THIS REGULATION PROVIDE?
It lays down an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements of MARPOL 73/78 to single-hull oil tankers.
It bans the transport of heavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all oil tankers of 5 000 tonnes deadweight and above:
flying the flag of an EU country;
entering or leaving a port or offshore terminal or anchoring in an area under the jurisdiction of an EU country.
For the purposes of this regulation, an ‘oil tanker’ means any ship constructed or retrofitted to carry oil in bulk as cargo and includes, inter alia, oil tankers, combination carriers and product carriers.
The regulation does not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship, owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service. The Member States undertake to respect this provision as far as is reasonable and practicable.
No oil tanker shall be allowed to operate under the flag of an EU country, nor shall any oil tanker, irrespective of its flag, be allowed to enter into ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of an EU country unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker carrying heavy grade oil shall be allowed to fly the flag of an EU country unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker carrying heavy grade oil, irrespective of its flag, shall be allowed to enter or leave ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of an EU country, unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker, irrespective of its flag, shall be allowed to enter or leave ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of an EU country unless such tanker complies with the condition assessment scheme (CAS) referred to in the regulation.
For the purposes of the regulation, the CAS adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2003 shall apply.
After the anniversary of the date of delivery of the ship in 2015, the following shall no longer be allowed:
the continued operation, in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78, of Category 2 and Category 3 oil tankers under the flag of an EU country;
the entry into the ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of an EU country of other Category 2 and Category 3 oil tankers, irrespective of the fact that they continue to operate under the flag of a third country in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
Each EU country shall inform the IMO of its decision to deny entry to oil tankers, pursuant to Article 7 of this regulation, operating in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78 into the ports or offshore terminals under its jurisdiction, on the basis of Regulation 20.8.2 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
Each EU country shall notify the IMO if it allows, suspends, withdraws or declines the operation of a Category 1 or a Category 2 oil tanker entitled to fly its flag, in accordance with Article 5 of this regulation, on the basis of Regulation 20.8.1 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 20 July 2012.
BACKGROUND
              
The EU is concerned about shipping accidents involving oil tankers and the associated pollution of its coastlines and harm to its fauna and flora and other marine resources.
The EU is also concerned about the safety of its citizens and the environment and has therefore adopted a number of measures to ensure that its waters are clean and safe.
For further information, please see the European Commission’s website on the prevention of oil pollution.

Summary 110:
 Regulation on the freedom of movement for workers within the EU
SUMMARY
This Regulation establishes a legal framework for the free movement of workers within the European Union (EU). It states that any national of an EU country has the right to take up an activity as an employed person and to pursue such activity in the territory of another EU country. This right is granted under the same conditions as the nationals of that country. In addition, this Regulation sets out the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a legal framework for the free movement of workers within the European Union (EU) and the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
It also states that any national of an EU country has the right to take up an activity as an employed person and to pursue such activity in the territory of another EU country. This right is granted under the same conditions as the nationals of that country.
KEY POINTS
The right to pursue an activity as an employed person is granted without discrimination by permanent, seasonal and frontier workers and by those who pursue their activities for the purpose of providing services.
The right of freedom of movement, in order that it may be exercised, by objective standards, in freedom and dignity, requires that equality of treatment be ensured in fact and in law in respect of all matters relating to the actual pursuit of activities as employed persons and to eligibility for housing, and also that obstacles to the mobility of workers be eliminated, in particular as regards the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
The principle of non-discrimination between workers in the EU means that all nationals of EU countries have the same priority as regards employment as is enjoyed by national workers.
The machinery for vacancy clearance, in particular by means of direct cooperation between the central employment services and also between the regional services, as well as by coordination of the exchange of information, ensures in a general way a clearer picture of the labour market.
Workers wishing to move should also be regularly informed of living and working conditions.
Close links exist between freedom of movement for workers, employment and vocational training, particularly where the latter aims at putting workers in a position to take up concrete offers of employment from other regions of the EU. Such links make it necessary that the problems arising in this connection should no longer be studied in isolation but viewed as interdependent, account also being taken of the problems of employment at the regional level. It is therefore necessary to direct the efforts of Member States toward coordinating their employment policies.
The right of all workers in the Member States to pursue the activity of their choice within the EU should be affirmed.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It has applied since 8 November 1968.
BACKGROUND
The free movement of workers is one of the pillars of the European Union (EU). It is one of the fundamental rights of citizens of the EU, which allows them to work in any EU country. The free movement of workers constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their families.
For further information, please see the European Commission's website on the free movement of workers.

It sets out the conditions for organisations to participate in the EU’s eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), a voluntary instrument that allows them to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the conditions for organisations to participate in the EU’s eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), a voluntary instrument that allows them to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection.
The regulation applies to organisations which carry out activities that have a significant environmental impact, regardless of their size or sector.
Organisations may register with the competent authorities in their respective EU countries.
Registration requires them to:
develop an environmental policy;
carry out an initial environmental review;
develop and implement an environmental management system;
establish environmental objectives and targets;
comply with applicable legal requirements relating to the environment;
publish an environmental statement;
implement an internal environmental audit;

Summary 118:
 Fighting against false documents
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) is facing an increasing number of false documents and identity fraud. The FADO system (Fight Against Document Fraud) was created in 1998 to help police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities in the EU to fight against these forms of fraud.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It updates the FADO system, which is a European database of information on authentic documents and methods of falsification. It is intended to contribute to the fight against document fraud and identity fraud.
KEY POINTS
The FADO system contains information on:
travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licences and vehicle licences issued by EU countries or by the EU;
false versions of such documents;
other related official documents, in particular those used in support of applications for official documents, issued by EU countries or by third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;
false versions of such documents and other related official documents.
The FADO system may contain other useful information, such as:
handbooks;
contact lists;
recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of falsification;
valid travel documents and their recognition by EU countries.
EU countries and the EU must transmit without delay the information on the documents referred to in the first paragraph to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the Agency).
EU countries may transmit to the Agency the information on the documents referred to in the second and third paragraphs.
Third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law, may transmit to the Agency the information on the documents referred to in the second and third paragraphs.
The Agency must ensure the proper and reliable functioning of the FADO system and provide support to the competent EU authorities in the detection of false documents.
The FADO system provides users with different levels of access to information. The Commission and the Agency, to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks, and the competent EU authorities, such as police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities, have secure access to the FADO system on a need-to-know basis. The following actors may obtain access to information stored in the FADO system in a limited manner:
the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies;
third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;
private entities, such as airlines and other carriers.
The Commission adopts delegated acts in order to establish measures granting access to information stored in the FADO system to the actors listed above.
EU countries determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud and other relevant national authorities are to have access to the FADO system, including the level of access with which they are to be provided, and notify the Commission and the Agency thereof.
The Agency must apply Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council when processing personal data under this regulation. It must ensure that technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, are in place in order to ensure that personal data are only processed to the extent strictly necessary for the purpose of operating the FADO system.
The Commission adopts implementing acts in order to:
establish the technical architecture of the FADO system;
establish the technical specifications for entering and storing information in the FADO system in accordance with high standards;
establish the procedures for controlling and verifying the information contained in the FADO system;
determine the date of the effective implementation of the FADO system by the Agency.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 26 April 2020.
BACKGROUND
The FADO system was created in 1998 to help police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities in the EU to fight against these forms of fraud.
The FADO system contributes to maintaining a high level of security within the EU by supporting police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities of the EU countries in the fight against document fraud, in particular at the external borders. Given that the detection of false documents is also important for citizens, organisations and businesses, the General Secretariat of the Council also made authentic documents available in a Public Register of Authentic Travel and Identity Documents Online, known as PRADO.
