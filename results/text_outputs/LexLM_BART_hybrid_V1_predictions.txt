EU rules on cross-border marketing of collective investment undertakings (UCITS) and social entrepreneurship funds (AIFs)
EU rules of the European Parliament and of the Council
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 — rules for the marketing and distribution of collective investments in collective undertakings
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for marketing and distributing collective investments* in collective investments*.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must ensure that marketing communications to investors are fair, clear and not misleading.
The regulation applies to the marketing of:
universally managed collective investment undertaking (i.e. a UCITS* or a social entrepreneurship fund) and AIFs;
social entrepreneurship funds* and EuVECA managers;
EuSEF managers.
It does not apply to:
management companies;
e.g. pension funds;
investment firms;
asset management companies.
A UCITS might be externally or internally managed, depending on its legal form.
Directive 2009/65/EC lays down minimum requirements for pre-disclosure documents and marketing communications.
Pre-marketing documents
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is responsible for standardising the notification, notification letter and marketing communication requirements for marketing communications for collective investments.
In order to avoid investors receiving two different documents, namely a key investor information document (KIID) and a key information document for the same investment undertaking, EU countries must require that all marketing communications addressed to investors must contain the same information.
Before marketing communications are sent to investors, the marketing communications must include the same key information, such as:
the name of the investment undertaking;
the investment undertaking’s name and address;
a description of the type of investment undertaking and its assets and liabilities;
an estimate of the amount of money invested in the fund;
information on the number of investors who have already invested in a fund and how much money they have withdrawn.
If a marketing communication does not contain all the information required by the regulation, the EU country concerned must send the relevant information to the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EIB).
The Commission must review the application of the regulation in the light of developments in the field of financial regulation in order to determine whether it should be amended or repealed.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The Regulation has applied since 2 August 2014 and had to become law in the EU countries by 2 August 2019.

Summary 5:
Removal of terrorist content from the EU’s digital single market
Removals from the European single market — hosting service providers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/852 — removing terrorist content
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to prevent the dissemination of terrorist material on the internet and to improve cooperation between EU countries’ law enforcement authorities to remove such material.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to providers of information society services which store and disseminate to the public information and material provided by a user of the service on request, irrespective of whether the storing and dissemination of such information or material is of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature.
It does not apply to content providers that store or disseminate material that could be considered to be terrorist content.
EU countries have the right to issue a removal order to a hosting service provider if they consider that the content does not comply with their terms and conditions.
Hosting service providers are responsible for the removal of or disabling of access to content that is not terrorist content if they believe that it is incompatible with their own terms or conditions. They must inform the competent authority that issued the removal order and inform the complainant of the reasons for their decision.
The competent authority may issue a decision to remove or disable access to the content if it considers that it does not conform with its terms of service.
Dispute procedure
The content provider must provide the complainant with a statement of reasons for its decision. If the content providers cannot comply with the order because it contains manifest errors or does not contain sufficient information for its execution, it must, without undue delay, notify the competent authorities and request clarification, using the template set out in Annex III of the regulation.
If a competent authority finds that a content provider has not complied with its decision, it can issue a reasoned decision to that effect.
Content providers whose content has been removed or access to which has been disabled following an order may have an effective remedy:
the right to challenge the decision before the courts of the EU country in which issued the order;
the obligation to preserve the content and related data.
Directive 2000/31/EC on the protection of personal data
The directive does not affect the application of Article 3(1) of Directive 2000/30/EC, which requires EU countries to ensure that personal data are protected in the event of criminal proceedings.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for harmonising the harmonised index of consumer price data in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The harmonised indices are used by the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to assess the level of price stability in the EU.
The HICP is based on observed prices, which include taxes on products. It is not intended to be a cost of living index.
EU countries must provide the Commission (Eurostat) with data on:
the prices of goods and services;
the price of foodstuffs; and
the cost of services.
HICP data are collected by the national statistical authorities of each EU country.
National statistical authorities must ensure the quality of the data provided.
They must also ensure that the data collected by EU countries are representative at EU country level and that they are comparable.
Eurostat may launch pilot studies to test the suitability of the OOH price index and the HPI.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 31 December 2011.
BACKGROUND
The EU’s harmonised consumer price index is one of the main tools used by Eurostat to monitor price stability across the EU and to determine whether the EU countries’ economies are experiencing price stability.
For more information, see:
The Harmonized index of price data (HICCP (European Commission).
The European Commission uses the harmonized index to monitor the price stability of EU countries.
KEY TERMS
* Harmonised index: a set of rules for reporting harmonised metadata to Eurostat on consumer prices.
* Household price: a measure of the price of a product, such as food or a service, which is sold on the market and which is subject to a price tax.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 laying down rules for applying the rules of the Anti-Deflating Agreements (ADAs)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules for implementing the 1994 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (‘GATT’) and lays down a framework for applying those rules in the EU.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (Euratom) No 1082/96.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all imports into the EU from non-EU countries, except those originating in the territory of the EU countries.
The rules apply to imports of goods originating from outside the EU and those originating within the EU, as well as those originating from the EU’s internal market.
Importers must notify the EU country in which they intend to import the goods.
EU countries must inform the European Commission of the import of the goods before they place them on their territory.
An EU country may initiate an investigation if it considers that the imports are dumping or that they have suffered injury to the EU industry.
If a country considers that a product is being dumped on its territory, it must lodge a complaint with the Commission.
A complaint may be lodged by any EU country or any other interested party on the basis of sufficient evidence to justify initiating an investigation.
Procedure
The investigation may be initiated within 60 days of receiving a complaint or within 14 days after receiving a request for an undertaking.
Investigations may be carried out by the Commission or by EU countries’ customs authorities.
Determining the normal value of a product
The Commission may establish a normal value for a product based on the average costs of the sellers or producers of the product concerned. These costs include transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs.
Where a country determines that the product has been dumped, it may impose a duty on the product.
In the event of a dispute between a country and an EU country, the Commission may impose duties on the country in question if it determines that it has suffered injury from the dumping or has suffered damage from the alleged dumping. The Commission may also impose duties if it is satisfied that the country has not complied with its obligations under the GATT agreement and that the damage caused by dumping or the alleged damage to the industry has not been fully compensated.

* Anti-deflating agreement: a bilateral agreement between the European Union and its trading partners on trade in goods between the two parties.
* Dumping: the practice of artificially lowering the prices of goods to artificially lower them on the international market, in order to prevent them from being sold or traded.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 37/2014 on the application of the principle of subsidisation
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for the investigation and prosecution of EU countries’ claims for anti-subsidy measures.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 597/2009.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to imports of agricultural products from non-EU countries.
EU countries may apply for a subsidy if they believe that they have been deprived of a fair share of the value-added tax (VAT) or the customs duty (CAD) for imports of certain agricultural products.
Procedure for investigations
The European Commission may investigate a complaint against an EU country’s decision to grant a subsidy. The complaint may be submitted to the Commission or to a Member State, which forwards it to the EU country which received the subsidy.
An investigation may cover both subsidisation and injury, and they must be investigated simultaneously.
Investigations must be carried out by the Commission.
The Commission may request EU countries to provide information to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (Euratom).
The investigation may also involve the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Auditors.
If the Commission concludes that the EU countries have not complied with the regulation, it may decide to impose a provisional counter-vailing duty (PCD) or impose a definitive duty (Duty) on imports.
Imposition of definitive duties
Imposing a provisional duty may only be imposed if:
the EU country has not met the conditions of the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 1 of the regulation;
the Commission has not been able to prove that the subsidy is not justified by the facts of the case;
there is no evidence of injury;
it has not provided the Commission with all the information it needs to make a decision on the issue.
Duties may not be imposed on imports from countries which have not met these conditions.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?

aduvants*,
sensors*,
targensors* and
solventicides*.
Safeners* are substances which can be applied to plants to prevent or eliminate disease or harm to plants.
The EU countries must apply for an authorisation for each active substance and/or synergist when they are submitted to a Member State by an applicant for authorisation under this regulation, provided that those test and study reports were:
necessary for an amendment of an authorised authorisation in order to allow the use on another crop;
certified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.
An EU country may refuse to authorise an active substance or a synergist if they consider that it poses a risk to human health or the environment.
EU countries may also refuse to grant authorisation to a product if it is likely to endanger human health, the environment or the health of animals or plants or if it does not comply with the requirements of this regulation.
Authorisation procedure

Requests for the obtaining of account information
The creditor must provide the court with:
a copy of the account information;
a blank standard form for the declaration pursuant to Article 25 showing that amounts have been preserved.
The court must decide whether the creditor is satisfied, on the basis of the evidence submitted by the creditor, that there is an urgent need for such account information because there is a risk that, without it, the subsequent enforcement of the creditor's claim against the debtor is likely to be jeopardised and that this could consequently lead to a substantial deterioration of the debtor's financial situation.
Decision on the request for the bank account information is made by the court in the country of origin.
If the court considers that the creditor has not provided sufficient evidence to support the existence of such a risk, it may refuse to issue the order.
Implementation of the order
The debtor must be notified of the decision on the order within 3 working days of receipt or issue of the declaration.
A creditor may appeal against a refusal to issue an order for the preservation of an account or an account.

Summary 141:
Cross-border insolvency proceedings — common rules for creditor information and communication in civil and commercial insolvencies (Regulation (EU) 2018/852)
Cross-Border insolvence proceedings — Common rules for creditors information and communications in civil & commercial insolventcies (Commission Regulation (EU))
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation(EU) No 852/2018 on the application of certain provisions of the European Union’s common rules on insolventcy proceedings
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out common rules to ensure that creditors who have their habitual residence, domicile or registered office in the EU are informed about the opening of insolvences relating to their assets.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies only to proceedings in respect of a debtor whose centre of main interests is located in the Union. It does not apply to proceedings which involve only the financial creditors of the debtor.
It does not affect national rules on recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.
Creditors have the right to lodge claims for their assets and to withdraw their claims where the law of the EU country in which the debtor has an establishment does not allow them to do so.
The procedure for lodging claims must be established in accordance with the standard claims form established in Article 88 of the Treaty on European Union (TFEU).
The creditor may lodge a claim in a national court in another EU country if:
the creditor is not located in that country;
the debtor has not moved to that country by the time the creditor lodges its claim;
claims are lodged in the claim in the country where the creditor is located;
there is a dispute between the creditor and the debtor over the lodgement of the claim.
Procedure for lodging the claim
The debtor must lodge its claim using the standard claim form established by Article 88.
If the creditor has moved to a country other than that of the one in which he or she is located, the creditor must lodge his or her claims in the jurisdiction of the court which delivered that decision. The creditor must be able to participate in the vote by distance means of communication, where national law so permits.
Where the creditor moves to a new country, the debtor may lodge his/her claims in that new country. If the creditor does not move, he/she must lodge them in the same country as the one where the debtor is located.
When a debtor moves to another country and the centre of its main interests are not located on its territory, it must not lodge its claims in its country of residence.
However, if the creditor decides to move to a non-EU country, it may lodge claims in a country where its centre of interests are located, provided that:
it has moved within the EU;
it is not subject to the laws of the country of origin of the creditor; and
the law of that country does not permit any means of challenging that act in the relevant case.
In addition, if a creditor moves from one EU country to another, they may lodge their claims in their home country, provided they do not have the necessary authorisation from the court in which they are lodged.
EU countries must ensure that the court with which a request for group coordination proceedings has been filed makes an assessment of those criteria prior to opening group coordination procedures.
Cooperation and communication
The European Commission has set up a European Network for the Coordination of Civil and Commercial Insolvency Arrangements (ENCCA) to facilitate the exchange of information on cross-border proceedings.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
Directive 2014/13/EU has applied since 1 July 2014 and had to become law in all EU countries by 1 July 2016.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a number of measures to modernise its legal framework for the application and management of insolvent cases.
For more information, see:
‘Interconnecting the EU’ on the European Commission's website.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND THE REGULATION?
The decision and the regulation aim to ensure that EU countries’ laws and regulations are compatible with the Athens convention on maritime accidents.
The regulation sets out the obligations of EU countries and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to ensure a high level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents, and the rules for insurance companies.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The convention applies to commercial carriage undertaken by EU countries or public authorities under contract of carriage within the territory of an EU country.
It does not apply to bareboat charter-out registration, in which the flag State for the purposes of bareboat registration is either a Member State or a contracting party to the convention.
EU countries must apply the convention’s rules for liability for damage caused to passengers and for loss of or damage to luggage and vehicles during the carriage of passengers and their cabin luggage during the period covered by the convention (i.e.
the period during which the passenger and his cabin luggage are on board the ship or in the course of embarkation or disembarkation, or the period of transport by water from land to the ship and vice-versa, if the cost of such transport is included in the fare or if the vessel used for this purpose of auxiliary transport has been put at the disposal of the passenger by the carrier.
Compulsory insurance and limitation of liability of insurers
Insurance companies must provide passengers with compulsory financial security for the duration of the carriage.
Insurers must provide the passenger with:
a certificate in the official language of the issuing EU country;
a statement of the identity of the carrier;
the name and address of the insurer;
an identification number of the passengers;
information on the type of baggage and the number of vehicles involved in the incident.
A certificate must be issued by the issuing country in accordance with the rules of the convention and must contain the following information:
the identity and nationality of the claimant and the date and place of death or injury;
details of the loss or damage caused by the incident and the amount of the compensation to be paid.
An insurance company must also provide the claimant with information on the number and type of the baggage and vehicles involved, including the type and quantity of the insurance policy.
Liability of carriers
The carrier is liable for the loss suffered as a result of the incident which caused the loss if the incident was due to the fault or neglect of a carrier. The burden of proving fault or negligence lies with the claimant. The carrier is also liable if the loss was caused by negligence on the part of a passenger who knew or ought reasonably to have known of the injury, loss and damage caused.
Limitations of liability
The liability of carriers is limited to 250,000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion. Insurance companies must ensure that the liability limit is not less than €21,000 for each passenger.
If a passenger dies or is seriously injured, the compensation must not be less than EUR 21 000. If the death or the injury or damage is caused by a vehicle, the claimant must be entitled to compensation of at least €20,000.
Carriers must notify the claimant of any damage to their baggage and/or vehicles.
Notice of loss of luggage and damage to vehicles
The claimant must give the carrier at least 30 days’ written notice of any loss of their baggage or vehicles. The notice must be provided in the most appropriate format.
Disputes must be settled by the claimant within 30 days of the date on which the incident took place. The claimant must provide proof that the carrier knew or should have known that their luggage or vehicles were damaged or that the incident caused damage.
Amendments to the regulation
Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/852 amends the regulation to take account of the fact that the convention has been amended by the International Monetary Fund (IMO) and that the EU is not a party to it.

The CMO is an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and is designed to contribute to the stabilisation and convergence of local markets in the EU with a view to achieving the objectives of the internal market.
It aims to:
facilitate the movement of products between EU countries;
improve the quality, size, weight, packing, presentation or labelling of products;
ensure that products are marketed in a more efficient and sustainable manner;
increase the level of competition to the production of, and trade in, agricultural products.
The regulation sets out the responsibilities of the producer organisations (known as associations of producer organisations) which have been recognised by the European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the production and marketing of fish, shellfish and fish.
Objectives
The objective of the association of producers is to achieve the following objectives:
to:
promote the production, packaging, packaging and presentation of products in a way that meets the objectives;
to improve the quality of the products and to ensure that they are labelled in accordance with the standards set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 on animal health and hygiene rules for food of food of origin (see summary);
to ensure that the products are labelled according to the standards laid down in the regulation;
provide consumers with information on the products they buy and the conditions under which they can buy them.
Associations of producers
The associations of producers may pursue the objectives listed above by:
improving the quality and packaging of their members’ products, taking into account the best available scientific advice;
promoting the sustainable management of their member producer organisations’ activities;
coordinating and developing activities of common interest for the member producers organisations.
Member producer organisations may also pursue two or more of the objectives set out above, in addition to the objectives laid down above:
improveing the conditions to be placed on the markets for their members' fishery products, in particular by setting minimum marketing sizes corresponding, where relevant, to minimum conservation reference sizes;
specifications of preserved products in line with conservation requirements and international obligations;
establishing a common storage mechanism to store fish stocks until such stocks have been used up.
Authorisation
Member countries may grant or withdraw the recognition of an association if it fails to fulfil its objectives or if it does not comply with the requirements of the regulation.
A producer organisation may apply for an authorisation from an EU country that does not recognise it.
An association may be established at the initiative of a producer organisation recognised in one or more EU countries and may be bound by the provisions of this regulation and to comply with its provisions.
If an association is recognised in more than one EU country, it must submit to the Commission an application for the authorisation to be granted by the EU country in which it is based. The Commission then forwards the application to the other EU countries, which then forwards it to the EFSA, which forwards it back to the EU countries that have granted or withdrawn the recognition to the producer organisation in question.

The ERDF is the main instrument of the European Union (EU), which aims to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
The regulation lays down the type of activities which can be supported by the ERDF, in order to support the investment priorities within the thematic objectives set out in Article 174 TFEU of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
The objectives of the Euratom are to:
increase the level of development in the most deprived regions;
reduce disparities between regions and the most developed regions and regions which are least developed;
improve the quality of life in the least developed regions, particularly in terms of health, education, housing and social services;
promote sustainable urban development;
contribute to the creation of jobs and growth and jobs;
support the development of cities and towns;
encourage innovation in urban areas;

The EURDF is designed to support activities in the following areas:
investment in the investment for growth, jobs and jobs goal;
investments in the Investment for jobs goal.
In order to achieve these objectives, the EURRDF is to support innovative actions in the area of urban development.
It is also responsible for:
supporting the implementation of integrated actions for sustainable urban developments (i.e. projects that aim to improve urban areas’ capacity to develop sustainable urban areas and reduce their environmental impact;
facilitating the sharing of facilities and human resources, and all types of infrastructure across borders in all regions. The EURD supports innovative actions which address issues related to sustainable cities and new solutions that are of relevance at Union level, such as:
the creation of a network of urban areas to support integrated urban development initiatives;
the development of a sustainable urban area network to improve the quality and efficiency of urban transport;
improving the efficiency of the transport sector;
developing a sustainable transport network to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas emissions from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC (see summary).
In addition to the above-mentioned activities, EURDP may also support the following activities:
promoting risk management investments, in particular by:
encouraging risk-based risk management;
ensuring that the EERDF is not used to finance activities that are contrary to the objectives of Horizon 2020;

European regional development fund (Euratom) – the European regional development goal
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 establishing the scope of the European Regional Development fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the EU’s framework for implementing the European Territorial Cooperation goal and lays down specific provisions concerning that goal.
It aims to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation sets out the scope and priorities of the ERDF for the 2007-2013 programming period (2007-2013) and for the 2014-2020 period (2014-2020).
Funding
The ERDF is funded by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It is the main instrument of the EU's cohesion policy, which aims to support the development of Europe's regions and the least developed regions. It is also the main source of financial support for the European Union's (EU's) cohesion policy.
The programme is divided into 3 strands:
Interregional cooperation — the aim to improve the quality of life for the most deprived regions and regions in the EU, particularly in rural areas and the most disadvantaged regions, in particular in the north, south and east;
interregional development — aims to increase the level of development in the least deprived regions, especially in the south, east and west;
integrated territorial investment — aims at improving the quality and efficiency of investment in the regions and areas most deprived by industrialisation and the social exclusion of rural areas.
Cooperation programmes — the programme designates regions, areas and areas that are eligible for support from the EIF and the EIB for the 2013-2020 programming period.
Programmes — the EDF and EIB are divided into 4 strands.
Scope of funding
The EDF covers the entire territory of the Union and all NUTS level 3 regions of the union along maritime borders separated by a maximum of 150 km, without prejudice to potential adjustments needed to ensure the coherence and continuity of cooperation programme areas established for the 2017-2020 programme period. The EDF also supports regional development projects in the North, the south and the east.
Objective criteria for designating eligible regions
The objective criteria are set out in the regulation. They include:
the geographical concentration and investment priorities;
the thematic concentration of the programmes;
a list of major projects for which the implementation is planned during the programming period;
an evaluation plan for each of the projects.
Eligible regions are defined according to the geographical concentration of their respective programmes and the investment priorities set out by the programme authorities.
A steering committee composed of representatives of the beneficiaries, programme authorities, authorities in participating EU countries, at local, regional or national level, as appropriate, and third countries, as well as the Commission, is responsible for managing the programme and the steering committee is chaired by the managing authority.
An EGTC is set up under the laws of one of the participating countries provided that it has been set up by at least two public authorities or bodies from at least 2 participating countries, and that it is composed of at least one public authority or body from each participating country. The managing authority is assisted by a legal body established under the law of a participating country or by an auditing body.
EU countries are responsible for the management and implementation of the cooperation programmes.
