Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 on the harmonisation of markets in financial instruments
SUMMARY
The Capital Markets Union (CMU) project aims to create a single market for capital in the European Union (EU) in order to provide businesses with the finance they need to develop and create jobs. This Regulation aims to establish a harmonised approach to marketing communications for both alternative investment funds (AIFs) and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). It also aims to address the issue of the cross-border distribution of such funds.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out requirements for marketing communications addressed to investors in AIFs and UCITS.
It also establishes common principles concerning fees or charges for supervisory and investigatory powers for competent authorities, and a central database for cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS.
It sets out rules on pre-marketing for qualifying venture capital funds and qualifying social entrepreneurship funds.
KEY POINTS
Marketing communications
Marketing communications addressed to investors in AIFs and UCITS must be identifiable as such and describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or UCITS in an equally prominent manner. They must also include information on the risks and rewards of such investment in a prominent manner.
In addition, all information included in marketing communications addressed to investors must be presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading. To ensure a level playing field between AIFs and UCITS, the standards for marketing communications apply to marketing communications of AIFs and UCITS.
Common principles concerning fees or charges
By 2 February 2020, competent authorities must publish and maintain up-to-date information on their websites listing the fees or charges levied by the competent authorities for supervision of cross-border activities.
ESMA central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:
all AIFs that are marketed in a Member State other than the home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed; and
all UCITS that are marketed in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed.
The database must be kept up to date.
Ex-ante verification of marketing communications
AIFMs, EuVECA managers, EuSEF managers and UCITS management companies must ensure that all marketing communications addressed to investors are identifiable as such and describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or units of a UCITS in an equally prominent manner, and that all information included in marketing communications is fair, clear and not misleading.
By 2 February 2021, ESMA must issue guidelines, and thereafter update those guidelines periodically, on the application of the requirements for marketing communications, taking into account on-line aspects of such marketing communications.
By 2 February 2021, competent authorities must publish on their websites the hyperlinks to the websites of competent authorities where the information referred to in the first paragraph of this point is published.
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:
all AIFs that are marketed in a Member State other than the home Member State, their AIFM, EuVECA manager or EuSEF manager, and the Member States in which they are marketed; and
all UCITS that are marketed in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State as defined in point (e) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, their UCITS management company and the Member States in which they are marketed.
The database must be kept up to date.
Pre-marketing
A manager of a qualifying venture capital fund may engage in pre-marketing in the Union, except where the information presented to potential investors:
is sufficient to allow investors to commit to acquiring units or shares of a particular qualifying venture capital fund;
amounts to subscription forms or similar documents whether in a draft or a final form; or
amounts to constitutional documents, a prospectus or offering documents of a not-yet-established qualifying venture capital fund in a final form.
By 2 February 2021, ESMA must issue guidelines, and thereafter update those guidelines periodically, on the application of the requirements for pre-marketing, taking into account on-line aspects of such pre-marketing.
By 2 February 2021, competent authorities must publish on their websites the hyperlinks to the websites of competent authorities where the information referred to in the first paragraph of this point is published.
By 2 February 2022, ESMA must publish on its website a central database on cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, publicly accessible in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, listing:

Summary 2:
Facilitating the provision of online services and retransmissions of television and radio programmes
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It establishes a legal framework for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
KEY POINTS
This directive establishes a legal framework for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
It facilitates the provision of online services for certain types of programmes, such as news and current affairs programmes, and for certain types of programmes produced by a broadcaster, such as a broadcaster’s own productions which are exclusively financed by it.
It lays down rules for the transmission of programmes through the process of direct injection, which is a technical process by which a broadcaster transmits its programme-carrying signals to an organisation other than a broadcaster, in such a way that the programme-carrying signals are not accessible to the public during that transmission.
It simplifies the clearance of rights for the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across borders.
It allows agreements concluded between a collective management organisation and operators of retransmission services for rights that are subject to mandatory collective management under this directive to be extended to apply to the rights of rightholders who are not represented by that collective management organisation, without those rightholders being allowed to exclude their works or other subject matter from the application of that mechanism.
It does not oblige broadcasters to provide online services across borders or to retransmit programmes originating in other EU countries.
It is without prejudice to the contractual freedom of rightholders and broadcasting organisations to agree, in compliance with EU law, to limit the exploitation of their rights, including those under Directive 2001/29/EC.
It is without prejudice to the right of broadcasters to communicate to the public or make available to the public programmes in their online services or to provide such online services in a Member State other than the Member State of their principal establishment.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
It applies from 7 June 2021.
BACKGROUND
The digital revolution has transformed the way in which television and radio programmes are distributed and accessed. Users increasingly expect to have access to television and radio programmes through traditional channels, such as satellite or cable, and also through online services.
This directive aims to facilitate the provision of online services and the retransmission of television and radio programmes across the EU.
For further information, please see the European Commission's website on the ‘digital single market’.
KEY TERMS
              
Broadcasting organisation: a body which transmits television and radio programmes intended for reception by the public.
Direct injection: a technical process by which a broadcasting organisation transmits its programme-carrying signals to an organisation other than a broadcasting organisation, in such a way that the programme-carrying signals are not accessible to the public during that transmission.
Ancillary online service: an online service which provides access to television and radio programmes in a strictly linear manner, simultaneously to the broadcast, and services that give access, within a defined time period after the broadcast, to television and radio programmes which have been previously broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, so-called ‘catch-up services’.
Retransmission: the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission by a cable or microwave system for reception by the public of an initial transmission from another Member State, by wire or over the air, including that by satellite, of television or radio programmes intended for reception by the public.

Regulation (EU) 2019/1831 — the.eu country code top-level domain
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the.eu country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU) and its variants in other scripts, in order to support the digital single market, to build an online EU identity and to encourage cross-border online activities.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all domain names registered under the.eu ccTLD.
The registration of domain names under the.eu ccTLD can be requested by any of the following:
a citizen of the EU, regardless of their place of residence;
a natural person who is not an EU citizen and who is a resident of an EU country;
an undertaking established in the EU;
an organisation established in the EU.
A domain name may be registered or reserved by the EU countries for their operational functions. The EU countries may also register or reserve domain names for broadly recognised geographical or geopolitical terms that affect their political or territorial organisation.
The regulation sets out the principles and procedures for the registration of domain names and the conditions for the implementation of the.eu ccTLD.
The regulation establishes the conditions for the designation and characteristics of the registry, which manages the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must be a not-for-profit organisation and must have its registered office, central administration and principal place of business within the EU.
The registry must comply with the EU data protection rules, principles and guidelines.
The registry must cooperate with the European Union Intellectual Property Office and other EU agencies with a view to combating the speculative and abusive registrations of domain names, including cyber squatting, and providing simple administrative procedures, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The registry must adopt clear policies aiming to ensure the timely identification of abusive registrations of domain names and, where necessary, should cooperate with competent authorities and other public bodies relevant to cybersecurity and information security which are specifically involved in the fight against such registrations, such as national computer emergency response teams (CERTs).
The registry must provide domain holders with the possibility of transferring their domain names to another holder in accordance with the principles and procedures on the functioning of the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must set up and manage, with due diligence, a WHOIS database facility for the purpose of ensuring the security, stability and resilience of the.eu ccTLD by providing accurate and up-to-date registration information about the domain names under the.eu ccTLD.
The registry must be designated by the European Commission following a selection procedure.
The Commission may request information from the registry to ensure that the principles and procedures on the functioning of the.eu ccTLD are respected.
The Commission may convey specific instructions to the registry for correcting or improving the organisation, administration and management of the.eu ccTLD.
The Commission may consult the.eu Multistakeholder Advisory Group and other relevant stakeholders and may seek expert advice on the results of the supervisory activities provided for in this regulation and on ways to improve the organisation, administration and management of the.eu ccTLD by the registry.
The regulation sets out the conditions for the supervision of the registry by the Commission.
The Commission shall designate an entity as the registry following the completion of the procedure referred to in the regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 19 October 2019.
BACKGROUND
The rapid evolution of the TLD market and the dynamic digital landscape require a future-proof and flexible regulatory environment.
The.eu ccTLD is one of the largest ccTLDs. The.eu ccTLD is used by the EU institutions, agencies and bodies, including for European projects and initiatives. The purpose of the.eu ccTLD is, through good management, to help enhance the EU identity and promote EU values online, such as multilingualism, respect for users' privacy and security and respect for human rights, as well as specific online priorities.
The regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 733/2002 to allow EU citizens to register a.eu ccTLD name, regardless of their place of residence, from 19 October 2019.

Summary 12:
interoperability of electronic road toll systems
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It aims to ensure that electronic road toll systems in the European Union (EU) are interoperable and that the cross-border enforcement of the obligation to pay road fees is facilitated.
KEY POINTS
Road fees are fees that users pay to use a specific road infrastructure or a specific vehicle access regulation scheme.
The EU already ensures the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the EU through the Eurovignette. The Eurovignette is a sticker that drivers of vehicles registered in the EU must display on their vehicles when driving on certain roads in other EU countries.
The Eurovignette is based on the principle of user pays, which means that the user of a service pays for it.
The Eurovignette was initially intended to cover only motorways and other roads with heavy traffic. However, it has since been extended to cover other roads and has become a way to finance the construction and maintenance of the road network.
The Eurovignette also applies to certain urban vehicle access regulation schemes such as low emission zones and restricted access zones.
The directive does not apply to parking fees.
The directive applies to electronic road toll systems which require the installation or use of on-board equipment (OBE).
The directive does not apply to road toll systems which are not electronic within the meaning of point 10 of Article 2 of the directive.
The directive applies to small, strictly local road toll systems for which the costs of compliance with the requirements of Articles 3 to 22 would be disproportionate to the benefits.
The directive does not apply to parking fees.

Summary 19:
Ensuring security of gas supply in the EU
SUMMARY
The EU has adopted a new regulation on security of gas supply. The aim is to ensure that gas is available in sufficient quantities for all EU citizens, businesses and industries at all times. The new rules complement existing legislation, which already requires EU countries to take certain preventive and mitigation measures to ensure security of gas supply.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It establishes a framework for EU countries to assess and manage risks to the security of gas supply. It also sets out a system of solidarity between EU countries in the event of a severe gas crisis.
KEY POINTS
The regulation covers both the prevention and the mitigation of risks to the security of gas supply. It sets out preventive action plans, emergency plans and an emergency response mechanism.
The preventive action plans include actions to:
increase gas storage capacity;
diversify gas supply routes;
enable bi-directional capacity on interconnection points.
The emergency plans include measures to:
introduce non-market-based measures;
reduce gas demand;
provide gas to solidarity protected customers;
introduce market-based measures;
use gas from LNG terminals.
EU countries must also:
cooperate with each other and with the European Commission to identify and manage risks;
adopt preventive and mitigation measures;
notify the Commission of any serious gas crisis;
take steps to ensure that gas is available in sufficient quantities for all EU citizens, businesses and industries at all times;
provide for the security of gas supply of customers in the territory of the EU.
The regulation provides for a solidarity mechanism between EU countries. This means that in the event of a severe gas crisis, EU countries that are not affected by the crisis will supply gas to those that are. The regulation also establishes a common risk assessment mechanism and a permanent reserve list for a monitoring task force.
EU countries must adopt the necessary measures to ensure that gas is supplied to solidarity protected customers in the requesting EU country in accordance with the regulation.
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 994/2010.
WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 May 2017.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted several pieces of legislation on the security of gas supply, including the Gas Directive (2003/55/EC) and the Gas Security of Supply Regulation (2004/682/EC).

Improving the quality of consumer price indices
Improving the quality of consumer price indices
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish a common framework for the production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at both national and EU level.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at national level;
the HICP at EU level;
the harmonised indices of consumer prices for the purposes of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure.
Scope of the harmonised indices
The harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) are based on observed prices, which include taxes on products. The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. The OOH price index is based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure for owner-occupied housing (OOH). The HPI is a necessary basis for compiling the OOH price index.
The regulation does not cover transactions between households, except in the case of rentals paid by tenants to private landlords, where the latter act as market producers of services purchased by households (tenants).
The HICP and the HICP-CT are broken down into categories of the European classification of individual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP).
The OOH price index and the HPI are broken down into categories of the European classification of individual consumption according to purpose (ECOICOP).
Calculation of the indices
The HICP and the HICP-CT are calculated using the Laspeyres-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of a period (b) prior to the price reference period, and are adjusted to reflect the prices of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
The OOH price index is calculated using the Paasche-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
The HPI is calculated using the Fisher-type index. This index is defined as follows:
The price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is denoted by 0, and the comparison period is denoted by t. Weights (w) are expenditure shares of a period (b) prior to the price reference period, and are adjusted to reflect the prices of the price reference period 0;
The index reference period is the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
The price reference period is the period for which the index is based.
Production of the indices
The indices are produced by the Member States. The HICP and the HICP-CT are produced at least once a month. The HPI is produced at least once a quarter. The OOH price index is produced at least once a year.
Quality of the indices
The quality of the indices produced is ensured by the Member States. The European Commission (Eurostat) verifies the sources and methods used by Member States to calculate the indices.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 13 June 2016.

EU anti-dumping regulation
EU anti-dumping regulation
The EU has adopted an anti-dumping (AD) system that aims to protect the EU market from dumped imports. The EU has adopted an anti-dumping (AD) system that aims to protect the EU market from dumped imports. It is one of the most important tools in the EU’s trade defence system, which also includes a system for safeguarding and a system for countering subsidies and dumping.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down the rules for investigating whether imports into the EU are dumped and whether they cause injury to the domestic industry.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down the rules for investigating whether imports into the EU are dumped and whether they cause injury to the domestic industry. It also establishes the procedures for imposing duties on such imports.
A product is considered to be dumped if its export price is less than the normal value of a like product, in the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country.
The normal value may be established on the basis of prices of other sellers or producers in the exporting country, or, in certain circumstances, in another country.
An investigation may be initiated by the Commission, on its own initiative or following a complaint from a producer or association of producers in the EU. It may also be initiated following a request from a Member State.
The Commission is assisted in its work by a committee which meets at least once a year.
The Commission may impose provisional duties on imports from countries suspected of dumping, if it considers that there is sufficient evidence to justify such duties.
It may also accept undertakings from exporters to revise their prices or to cease exports at dumped prices.
The Commission may also decide to terminate a case without applying duties or to impose definitive duties.
Duties are imposed in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis, on imports from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury.
Duties may be imposed for a period of 5 years at the most. They may be extended in exceptional circumstances.
Duties may be imposed only on imports from exporters or producers which have made themselves known in accordance with the regulation, unless they have accepted an undertaking.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 30 May 2016.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 on protection against subsidised imports from third countries
Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 establishes the rules for the application of countervailing measures against subsidised imports from third countries. These measures consist in the imposition of duties on imports of a product from a country, or from a group of countries, which are found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the producers of like products in the European Union.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for the application of countervailing measures against subsidised imports from third countries. These measures consist in the imposition of duties on imports of a product from a country, or from a group of countries, which are found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the producers of like products in the European Union.
KEY POINTS
Subsidies
A subsidy is a financial contribution by a government or public body which confers a benefit on certain undertakings or products. These subsidies may be granted directly by the government or indirectly through state-owned enterprises.
A subsidy is considered countervailable if it is specific, that is, it is limited in extent or available only to certain enterprises, or contingent in nature, that is, it is tied to export performance or the use of domestic over imported goods.
If a subsidy is found to be countervailable, the European Commission may decide to initiate an investigation into whether the subsidised imports cause injury to the European Union industry and whether the injury is due to the subsidisation. The Commission then imposes a countervailing duty on the imports from the country or countries concerned.
The Commission may also decide to terminate the investigation without imposing a countervailing duty in the following cases:
if the amount of countervailable subsidies is de minimis, that is, it is less than 5 % of the value of imports of the like product from all third countries during the investigation period;
if the volume of subsidised imports is negligible, that is, it is less than 3 % of the total imports of the like product in the European Union;
if the volume of subsidised imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible.
In order to determine whether a subsidy is countervailable, the Commission may ask for information from the European Union industry, from the country or countries concerned, as well as from any interested party in the European Union or in the country or countries concerned.
The Commission must inform the Member States of any request for information and provide them with copies of the questionnaire.
The Commission must publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union within 45 days of the date on which the complaint was lodged.
The Commission must reject a complaint where it considers that there is insufficient evidence to justify proceeding with the case.
The Commission may decide to accept an undertaking offered by the exporter or the country concerned that eliminates or offsets the countervailable subsidies and injury instead of imposing a countervailing duty.
The Commission may decide to terminate the investigation without imposing a countervailing duty in the following cases:

The Commission must impose a countervailing duty on imports from all sources found to benefit from countervailable subsidies and to cause injury to the European Union industry.
The Commission may decide to increase the countervailing duty in order to achieve the price increase required to remove injury.
The Commission may decide to suspend the countervailing duties in cases where the European Union interest calls for intervention.

Regulation (EU) 2018/1882 — Gross National Income at market prices
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the definition of gross national income (GNI) at market prices and the rules for its calculation in accordance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010).
It sets out the rules for the transmission of GNI data and additional information by the EU countries to the European Commission (Eurostat).
It lays down procedures and checks on the calculation of GNI by the EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Gross national income at market prices
GNI is defined in Article 1 of the regulation. It is calculated in accordance with the ESA 2010, which is established by Regulation (EU) No 549/2013. In accordance with point 8.89 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, GDP means the final result of the production activity of resident producer units. It can be defined in 3 ways:
production approach: GDP is the sum of gross value added of the various institutional sectors or the various industries plus taxes and less subsidies on products (which are not allocated to sectors and industries). It is also the balancing item in the total economy production account;
expenditure approach: GDP is the sum of final uses of goods and services by resident institutional units (final consumption and gross capital formation) plus exports and minus imports of goods and services;
income approach: GDP is the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy). In accordance with point 8.94 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, GNI means the total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. GNI equals GDP minus primary income payable by resident institutional units to non-resident institutional units plus primary income receivable by resident institutional units from the rest of the world.
Transmission of GNI data and additional information
Before 1 October each year, the EU countries must provide the Commission (Eurostat), in the context of national accounting procedures, with figures for GNI aggregates and their components, in accordance with the definitions referred to in Article 1. The transmission of data shall be accompanied by a report on the quality of GNI data. The Commission shall establish, by means of implementing acts, the structure and detailed arrangements of the inventory referred to in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, in accordance with Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, as well as the timetable for its updating and transmission. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 8(2) of this Regulation.
Procedures and checks on the calculation of GNI
The Commission shall verify the sources, their uses and the methods in the inventory referred to in Article 3(1). The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 7 to supplement the provision laid down in the first subparagraph of this paragraph by defining the list of issues to be addressed in every verification cycle to ensure the reliability, exhaustiveness and highest possible degree of comparability of GNI data, in line with ESA 2010. The Commission shall establish, by means of implementing acts, specific measures to make GNI data more comparable, reliable and exhaustive, based on the list of issues defined by the Commission in the delegated acts referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article. Such implementing acts shall be duly justified and in accordance with ESA 2010. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 8(2).
Without prejudice to the inspections provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 608/2014, GNI information visits may, where deemed appropriate, be carried out in EU countries by the Commission (Eurostat). The purposes of the information visits referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be the verification of the quality of GNI aggregates and their components and the verification of compliance with ESA 2010. In exercising its right to carry out such information visits, the Commission (Eurostat) shall respect the rules on statistical confidentiality laid down in Chapter V of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 April 2019.
BACKGROUND
GNI is an important analytical tool for the coordination of national economic policies and for various EU policies, as well as for research activities.
For own resources purposes, GNI means an annual GNI at market prices under the methodology set out in Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 which established the revised European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).
In accordance with Article 10(1) of Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, and subject to Article 10(2) thereof, Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom was repealed.

SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down the rules for granting EU type-approval to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which have been approved in the United Kingdom (UK) and which are placed on the EU market after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
KEY POINTS
Scope
This regulation applies to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which fall within the scope of Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and their types which have been approved by the UK type-approval authority on the basis of those acts or any regulatory act of the Union listed in Annex IV to Directive 2007/46/EC or any regulatory act repealed by those regulatory acts of the Union.
Conditions for the granting of a Union type-approval and its effects
The Union type-approval may be granted on the basis of the same test reports which were used for the UK type-approval. Before granting a Union type-approval, the Union type-approval authority may request the repetition of specific tests. In that case, those tests shall be carried out by a technical service which has been designated and notified by the Member State of the Union type-approval authority in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628.
The type approved in accordance with the regulation shall receive an EU type-approval certificate with a number consisting of the distinguishing number of the Member State whose type-approval authority granted the Union type-approval and of the number of the applicable act referred to in Article 2(1). It shall also include the number of the latest amending act containing requirements for type-approval in accordance with which the Union type-approval is granted.
For vehicles, the type-approval certificate and the certificate of conformity shall, under ‘Remarks:’, contain the mention ‘Previously type-approved as’ and refer to the number and the date of the EU type-approval certificate received following the UK type-approval. For systems, components or separate technical units, the type-approval certificate shall contain the mention ‘Previously type-approved and marked as’ and refer to the type-approval mark received following the UK type-approval.
The Union type-approval shall take effect on the day of its granting or on a later date determined therein. The UK type-approval shall become invalid on the day preceding the day on which the Union type-approval takes effect. In any event, it shall become invalid at the latest on the day on which the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.
A Union type-approval shall be considered to be an EC type-approval or an EU type-approval within the meaning of Directive 2007/46/EC or any act listed in Annex IV to that Directive, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. All provisions of those acts not derogated from in this regulation shall continue to apply.
The Union type-approval authority shall take full responsibility for the obligations stemming from the Union type-approval. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced on the basis of a UK type-approval which has become invalid as a result of the granting of a Union type-approval may be placed on the market, registered and entered into service in the EU until the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.

Summary 36:
European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the ‘Instrument’). The Instrument aims to provide financial assistance to EU countries experiencing, or threatened with, a severe economic disturbance due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The financial assistance is intended to support short-time work schemes or similar measures, and, where appropriate, some health-related measures.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 25 March 2020.
KEY POINTS
The Instrument complements national measures taken by EU countries by providing financial assistance to help them cope with the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure intended to mitigate the direct economic, social and health-related effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
EU countries may request financial assistance under the Instrument where their actual and possibly also planned public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased as of 1 February 2020 due to national measures directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures to address the socio-economic effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The financial assistance takes the form of a loan granted by the EU to the EU country concerned. The Commission borrows on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the EU.
The maximum amount of financial assistance is EUR 100 billion for all EU countries.
The Commission consults the EU country concerned before submitting a proposal to the Council. The Council then decides on the amount of the loan, its maximum average maturity, its pricing formula, its maximum number of instalments, its availability period and the other detailed rules needed for the granting of the financial assistance. The Council considers the existing and expected needs of the requesting EU country, as well as requests for financial assistance already submitted or planned to be submitted by other EU countries, while applying the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency.
The loan granted under the Instrument is disbursed in instalments.
The borrowing and lending operations under the Instrument are carried out in euros. The characteristics of the loan are agreed in a loan agreement between the beneficiary EU country and the Commission.
The prudential rules applicable to the portfolio of loans include a maximum share of loans granted to the 3 EU countries representing the largest share of the loans granted (60 %), a maximum annual exposure of EUR 50 billion, and a maximum amount of EUR 10 billion due by the EU in a given year.
The Commission establishes the necessary arrangements for the administration of the loans with the European Central Bank. The beneficiary EU country opens a special account with its national central bank for the management of the financial assistance received.
EU countries may contribute to the Instrument by counter-guaranteeing the risk borne by the EU. Contributions from EU countries are provided in the form of irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand guarantees.
The Instrument becomes available once the Commission has informed the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Financial Committee and the Employment Committee of the use of financial assistance and the continuation of the exceptional occurrences that justify the application of this Regulation. The period of availability of the Instrument ends on 31 December 2022. The Council may decide to extend the period of availability of the Instrument for an additional period of 6 months.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 25 March 2020.
BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 outbreak has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic systems of EU countries, caused societal disruptions and increased public expenditure in a growing number of EU countries. The SURE aims to provide financial assistance to EU countries experiencing, or threatened with, a severe economic disturbance due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The financial assistance is intended to support short-time work schemes or similar measures, and, where appropriate, some health-related measures.

Summary 38:
European Year of Rail 2021
The year 2021 will be designated the ‘European Year of Rail’, to encourage and support efforts across the European Union (EU) to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail.
WHAT DOES THIS DECISION DO?
It designates the year 2021 the ‘European Year of Rail’.
It sets out the objectives of the European Year, namely to promote rail as a sustainable, innovative, interconnected and intermodal, safe and affordable mode of transport.
KEY POINTS
To achieve the objectives, the European Commission will:
consider initiatives such as a European label for goods and products transported by rail and a rail connectivity index;
support the creation of a European rail network;
support the development of innovative solutions and services for rail passengers;
support the development of a European rail sector;
encourage the use of rail in remote areas and rural regions;
support the development of a rail sector workforce;
support the development of new rail products;
support the development of a European rail tourism market;
support the development of a rail freight market;
support the development of a European rail passenger market;
support the development of a rail sector for people with disabilities;
support the development of a rail sector for young people.
The Commission will also:
coordinate the European Year at Union level;
support the European Year at national level;
cooperate with international organisations;
monitor and evaluate the European Year.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
The decision applies from 1 January 2021 until 31 December 2022.
BACKGROUND
The European Green Deal aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050.
The EU aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The transport sector accounts for a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, a share that is still growing. To achieve climate neutrality, a 90 % reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050.
The European Green Deal implies accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobility in order to address those challenges. In particular, a substantial part of the 75 % of inland freight carried today by road should be shifted onto rail and inland waterways.
Rail has a significant role to play as a game changer in achieving the climate neutrality objective by 2050. It is one of the most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. Rail is largely electrified and emits far less CO2 than equivalent travel by road or air. It is the only transport mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990. In addition, rail has decreased its energy consumption between 1990 and 2016 and increasingly uses renewable energy sources.
The COVID-19 crisis has hit the transport sector exceptionally hard. Despite operational and financial constraints, the sector has maintained crucial connections both for the transport of people and of essential goods. This has been possible mainly thanks to the employees who have continued working under difficult and uncertain conditions. The strategic role played by rail during the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted that achieving the single European railway area is necessary both for facilitating the supply of essential goods, such as food, medicines and fuel, particularly in exceptional circumstances, and for achieving wider transport policy objectives.
The rail sector is sometimes hampered by outdated business and operational practices, by ageing infrastructure and rolling stock and by noisy wagons. Overcoming those obstacles together with reducing costs, studying Union schemes to supplement national mechanisms for non-discriminatory support for rail operators, and accelerating innovation will allow rail to realise its full potential, while ensuring the functioning of the internal market, increasing rail traffic and further improving the already high safety levels.
The year 2021 will be important for the EU rail policy, since it will represent the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the EU, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services, on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the EU and on providing the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) with additional tasks that aim to lower technical barriers.
The European Year of Rail will contribute to a pan-European debate on the future of railways.

EU statistics on inland waterways transport
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on EU statistics on inland waterways transport
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes common rules for the production of European statistics concerning inland waterways transport.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to inland waterways transport in the EU. It does not apply to the transport of goods by vessels of less than 50 deadweight tonnes, vessels used principally for the carriage of passengers, vessels used for ferrying purposes, vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes by port administrations and public authorities, vessels used solely for bunkering or storage, and vessels not used for the carriage of goods such as fishery vessels, dredgers, floating workshops, houseboats and pleasure craft.
Data
Member States must transmit data relating to inland waterways transport on their national territory to the European Commission (Eurostat). They must do so as soon as possible and no later than 5 months after the end of the relevant period of observation.
Inland waterways transport is an important part of the EU’s transport networks. The Commission therefore needs statistics on the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy.
Data collection
The Commission must arrange for pilot studies to be conducted on the availability of statistical data relating to passenger transport by inland waterways, including by cross border transport services. The EU contributes to the cost of carrying out those pilot studies in the form of grants awarded to the national statistical institutes and other national authorities.
Quality of data
Member States must take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the data transmitted. The Commission (Eurostat) must assess the quality of the data transmitted.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 7 December 2016.
BACKGROUND
              
The regulation is one of the EU’s statistics regulations which set out common rules for the production of European statistics.

It sets out common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at European Union (EU) level.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all railways in the EU.
Each EU country must report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory.
Definitions
The regulation defines a number of terms, including:
railway: a line or system of lines designed for the carriage of passengers or goods, or both, by rail vehicles operated by one or more undertakings, on which service is regularly provided;
metro: a railway for the transport of passengers that operates in a dense urban area with high passenger traffic volumes, which uses fully automated or partly automated vehicles and which is usually fully segregated from other road traffic;
tram (streetcar): a passenger road vehicle designed to seat more than nine persons (including the driver), which is connected to electric conductors or powered by diesel engine and which is rail-borne;
light rail: a railway for the transport of passengers that often uses electrically powered rail-borne cars operating singly or in short trains on fixed duo-rail lines;
international transport: rail transport between a place (of loading/embarkation or unloading/disembarkation) located in the reporting country. It may involve transit through a second country;
transit: rail transport through the reporting country between two places (a place of loading/embarkation and a place of unloading/disembarkation) outside the reporting country. Transport operations involving loading/embarkation or unloading/disembarkation of goods/passengers at the border of the reporting country from/onto another mode of transport are not considered as transit;
rail passenger: any person, excluding members of the train crew, who makes a trip by rail. Only the distance on the national territory of the reporting country shall be taken into account;
goods: any material object that can be moved, shipped, carried or transferred from one location to another.
Reporting
EU countries must report statistics based on the data specified in the Annexes to the regulation. The Annexes specify the types of data to be collected, the type of transport, the type of consignment, the type of activity, the type of transport and the type of consignment.

FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 May 2021.
BACKGROUND
The unprecedented measures taken in response to the exceptional situation caused by COVID-19, which is beyond the control of Member States, have caused significant disturbances to economic activity which are reflected in a steep decline in gross domestic product and a significant impact on employment, social conditions, poverty and inequalities. In particular, those measures have disrupted supply chains and production and caused absences from the workplace. In addition, the provision of many services has become very difficult or impossible. At the same time, consumer demand has dropped. Many businesses are experiencing liquidity shortages, and their solvency is at risk, while the financial markets are very volatile. Key sectors like travel and tourism are particularly hard hit.
The crisis caused by COVID-19 has spread quickly in the Union and in third countries. A sharp contraction of growth in the Union is foreseen for 2020. Recovery risks being very uneven in different Member States, increasing the divergence between national economies. The different fiscal abilities of Member States to provide financial support where it is needed most for recovery and the divergence between Member States’ measures endanger the single market as well as social and territorial cohesion.
A comprehensive set of measures is needed for economic recovery. That set of measures requires substantial amounts of public and private investment to set the Union firmly on the path towards a sustainable and resilient recovery, create high-quality jobs, support social inclusion and repair the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 crisis, whilst supporting the Union’s green and digital priorities.
As this Regulation is an exceptional response to temporary but extreme circumstances, the support provided under it should only be made available for the purposes of addressing the adverse economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis or the immediate funding needs to avoid a re-emergence of the COVID-19 crisis.

Summary 66:
amending the Stability and Growth Pact
SUMMARY
Amending the Stability and Growth Pact
SUMMARY
Amending the Stability and Growth Pact
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area through the introduction of a new system of sanctions for the preventive and corrective parts of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out a system of sanctions for enhancing the enforcement of the preventive and corrective parts of the SGP in the euro area.
The preventive part of the SGP includes the multilateral surveillance system as organised by Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 (see summary). The corrective part of the SGP refers to the procedure for the avoidance of Member States’ excessive deficit as regulated by Article 126 TFEU and Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 (see summary).
Sanctions in the preventive part of the SGP
If the Council adopts a decision establishing that a Member State has failed to take action in response to a recommendation from the Commission, the Commission shall recommend that the Council require the Member State in question to lodge an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission amounting to 0.2 % of its GDP in the preceding year.
The Council may decide to reduce or cancel the deposit on the basis of a reasoned request from the Member State concerned. The Commission may also recommend reducing or cancelling the deposit on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances.
If the Council decides that the situation giving rise to the Council recommendation has come to an end, the deposit and the interest accrued thereon shall be returned to the Member State concerned.
Sanctions in the corrective part of the SGP
If the Council decides that a Member State has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit, the Commission shall recommend that the Council impose a fine on the Member State amounting to 0.2 % of its GDP in the preceding year. The fine shall be converted into a non-interest-bearing deposit if the Member State has already lodged an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission.
The Commission may also recommend reducing or cancelling the fine on the basis of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request from the Member State concerned.
If the Council decides to abrogate some or all of its decisions, the non-interest-bearing deposit shall be returned to the Member State concerned.
Sanctions concerning the manipulation of statistics
The Council may decide to impose a fine on a Member State that intentionally or by serious negligence misrepresents deficit and debt data relevant for the application of Articles 121 or 126 TFEU or for the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU.
The fines shall be effective, dissuasive and proportionate to the nature, seriousness and duration of the misrepresentation. The amount of the fine shall not exceed 0.2 % of GDP of the Member State concerned.
The Commission may conduct investigations necessary to establish the existence of the misrepresentations. It may decide to initiate an investigation when it finds that there are serious indications of the existence of facts liable to constitute such a misrepresentation.
The Commission shall fully respect the rights of defence of the Member State concerned during the investigations.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 11 concerning:
detailed criteria establishing the amount of the fine;
detailed rules concerning the procedures for the investigations, the associated measures and the reporting on the investigations;
detailed rules of procedure aimed at guaranteeing the rights of the defence, access to the file, legal representation, confidentiality and provisions as to timing and the collection of the fines.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has unlimited jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Council imposing fines under the regulation. It may annul, reduce or increase the fine so imposed.
The sanctions imposed pursuant to Articles 4 to 8 of the regulation are of an administrative nature.
The interest earned by the Commission on deposits lodged in accordance with Article 5 and the fines collected in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 shall constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 TFEU, and shall be assigned to the European Financial Stability Facility. When the Member States whose currency is the euro create another stability mechanism to provide financial assistance in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole, the interest and the fines shall be assigned to that mechanism.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 13 December 2011.
BACKGROUND

Strategic Innovation Agenda 2021-2027 for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is an EU agency that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship in Europe by supporting the development of new ideas and the creation of innovative products, services and business opportunities. The EIT is an important pillar of the European Union’s research and innovation programme Horizon Europe. The EIT aims to boost the innovation capacity of Europe by supporting the development of new ideas and the creation of innovative products, services and business opportunities. The EIT does this through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together universities, research institutes, companies and entrepreneurs to develop new ideas and innovative solutions to major global challenges. The EIT also supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS). The EIT supports the KICs in developing and implementing their multiannual strategies, which define their priorities and activities for the period from 2021 to 2027. The EIT is based in Budapest and has a network of 5 co-location centres across the EU.
WHAT DOES THE STRATEGIC INNOVATION AGENDA DO?
It sets out the priority fields and the strategy of the EIT for the period from 2021 to 2027.
It also reflects Regulation (EU) 2021/695, and, in particular, the key role of the EIT as part of Pillar III ‘Innovative Europe’ of Horizon Europe, and its contribution to addressing global and societal challenges, including established targets and commitments to climate objectives and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to Pillar I ‘Excellent Science’ and Pillar II ‘Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness’ of Horizon Europe.
It builds on the lessons learnt over the previous years of operation of the EIT and the results of a wide consultation process with key stakeholders.
It contributes to tackling global and societal challenges, including the SDGs by following the principles of the Paris Agreement adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (2), and to achieving a net-zero greenhouse gas economy by 2050 at the latest.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the KICs, including through the involvement of new partners in other sectors, countries and regions, in order to address disparities in innovation capacity and to enhance knowledge and innovation diffusion across the EU.
It supports the innovation capacity of Europe through the RIS, which is intended to act as a catalyst for innovation and knowledge transfer by providing support for the KICs’ activities and by promoting the development of innovation ecosystems across the EU.

SUMMARY
Rules on labelling and selling of aromatised wine products
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules on the labelling and description of aromatised wine products and on the sales denominations of such products.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all aromatised wine products placed on the market in the EU, whether produced in the EU or in third countries.
Aromatised wine products
Aromatised wine products are products obtained from products of the wine sector that have been flavoured. They may be sweetened or not, and may be flavoured with herbs or spices or fruit. They may be alcoholic or not, and may be flavoured with herbs or spices or fruit. They may be alcoholic or not, and may be sweetened or not.
The regulation defines 12 categories of aromatised wine products, which are set out in Annex II. These are: ‘Aromatised wine’, ‘Bitter aromatised wine’, ‘Egg-based aromatised wine’, ‘Sangria/Sangria’, ‘Clarea’, ‘Zurra’, ‘Bitter lemon’, ‘Glühwein’, ‘Maiwein’, ‘Maitrank’, ‘Aromatizovaný dezert’ and ‘Aromatised wine-product cocktail’.
The regulation lays down the sales denominations for each category of product.
Production processes and methods of analysis for aromatised wine products
The regulation lays down the requirements, restrictions and descriptions of the production processes for aromatised wine products. These are set out in Annex I.
The regulation also lays down the rules for the production, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products with a geographical indication.
Geographical indications
A geographical indication identifies an aromatised wine product as originating in a region, a specific place or a country where a given quality, reputation or other characteristics of that product are essentially attributable to its geographical origin, including its terroir* and human factors.
The conditions for the protection of geographical indications are set out in Chapter IV of the regulation. They include a definition of geographical indication (Article 2(3)), and the conditions for eligibility (Article 10).
A geographical indication may be registered in the EU if it meets the conditions set out in this regulation and if it is not a homonymous* name.
EU geographical indications are listed in an electronic register, which is accessible to the public.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 27 March 2014.
BACKGROUND
              
The EU is a major producer of aromatised wine products, which are important for consumers, producers and the agricultural sector in the EU. By doing so, the measures will safeguard the reputation that the EU’s aromatised wine products have achieved in the internal market and on the world market by continuing to take into account the traditional practices used in the production of aromatised wine products as well as increased demand for consumer protection and information.
KEY TERMS
              
* Terroir: a combination of soil, climate and terrain that gives a product a distinctive character.
* Homonymous: names which have the same or a similar sound or spelling or which may suggest the same region or place of origin.

SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) is providing macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Ukraine in the form of loans with a view to supporting, in particular, its economic resilience and stability.
WHAT DOES THE DECISION DO?
It authorises the European Commission to make available to Ukraine a maximum of €1.2 billion in MFA.
KEY POINTS
The decision is without prejudice to the powers of the European Parliament and the Council as budgetary authority.
The Commission manages the MFA.
The MFA is provided in the form of loans, with a maximum average maturity of 15 years.
The release of the MFA is subject to the approval of the EU budget by the European Parliament and the Council.
The MFA is made available for a period of 12 months, starting on the first day after the entry into force of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) referred to in Article 3(1).
A precondition for granting the MFA is that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system, and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights.
The Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) monitor the fulfilment of the precondition set out in Article 2(1) throughout the life-cycle of the MFA.
The Commission agrees with the Ukrainian authorities on clearly defined economic policy and financial conditions, focusing on structural reforms and sound public finances, to which the MFA is to be subject.
The Commission regularly monitors the progress in attaining those objectives.
The MFA is disbursed in two equal instalments, each of which consists of a loan.
The Commission decides on the release of each instalment, subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions:
the precondition set out in Article 2(1);
a continuous satisfactory track record of implementing a non-precautionary International Monetary Fund (IMF) credit arrangement;
the satisfactory implementation of the economic policy and financial conditions agreed in the MOU.
The Commission informs the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to the MFA and provides them with the relevant documents.
The borrowing and lending operations related to the MFA are carried out in euro using the same value date and shall not involve the EU in the transformation of maturities, or expose the EU to any exchange or interest rate risk, or to any other commercial risk.
The MFA is implemented under direct management.
The Commission assesses, by means of an operational assessment, the soundness of Ukraine’s financial arrangements, the administrative procedures, and the internal and external control mechanisms which are relevant to the assistance.
The Commission is assisted by a committee.
The Commission submits to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of the decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation, by 30 June of each year.
The Commission submits to the European Parliament and to the Council an ex-post evaluation report, assessing the results and efficiency of the completed MFA and the extent to which it has contributed to the aims of the assistance, not later than 2 years after the expiry of the availability period referred to in Article 1(4).
The decision enters into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?

Summary 82:
swordfish — multiannual recovery plan
SUMMARY
The aim of this Regulation is to implement the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Mediterranean and Black seas. This recovery plan was adopted by the ICCAT at its 2016 annual meeting in Vilamoura, Portugal.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that Mediterranean swordfish are fished in a sustainable way, in order to allow the stock to recover.
KEY POINTS
The recovery plan sets out a number of measures for the fishing industry and recreational fisheries.
Fishing effort
A limit is placed on the number of fishing vessels allowed to fish for Mediterranean swordfish, depending on the type of fishing gear used.
The fishing season
A closure period is set, during which no fishing may take place for Mediterranean swordfish. This period is from 1 January to 31 March of each year. In addition, a closure period is set for longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from 1 October to 30 November of each year.
Minimum conservation reference size
The minimum conservation reference size for Mediterranean swordfish is 100 cm.
Technical characteristics of the fishing gear
The hook size of the fishing gear used to catch Mediterranean swordfish is limited to 7 cm in height.
Landings and transhipments
Landings and transhipments of Mediterranean swordfish must take place in designated ports, and the vessels carrying them must be authorised to do so.
Inspections
The Commission, or a body designated by it, may assign Union inspectors to the ICCAT scheme for joint international inspection, which is set out in Annex III to this Regulation.
Recreational fisheries
Only ‘rod and line’ vessels may be authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish in recreational fisheries.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 15 July 2018.
BACKGROUND
Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is a large migratory species that is found in the Mediterranean and Black seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. It is an important commercial species and is also highly prized in recreational fisheries.
Mediterranean swordfish has been overfished over the last 30 years and its current status does not allow it to produce the maximum sustainable yield in the short term. In order to allow the stock to recover, a multiannual recovery plan was adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its 2016 annual meeting in Vilamoura, Portugal.
This Regulation implements this recovery plan into Union law.
For further information, please see the factsheet on the ICCAT recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish.
KEY TERMS
              
Mediterranean swordfish: a species of fish of the Xiphias gladius genus, which is found in the Mediterranean and Black seas, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean.

Multiannual financial framework 2014–2020
SUMMARY
The multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘MFF’) is set out in Regulation (EU) No 966/2012. This regulation determines the ceilings for expenditure and revenue for the general budget of the European Union (EU) for the period 2014-2020.
What is the MFF?
The MFF sets out the ceilings for expenditure and revenue for the general budget of the European Union (EU) for the period 2014-2020. It also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF.
The MFF is a seven-year planning and programming tool for the EU. It ensures a stable and predictable framework for the implementation of the EU budget and for the planning of EU policies.
The MFF consists of:
—
a set of expenditure ceilings for each of the headings of the EU budget (smart and inclusive growth, sustainable growth: natural resources, security and citizenship, global Europe and administration);
—
an own-resources ceiling, which limits the total amount of own resources that can be collected from the EU countries.
The MFF also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF. These instruments are the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the global margin for commitments for growth and employment, in particular youth employment.
What is the purpose of the MFF?
The MFF is a seven-year planning and programming tool for the EU. It ensures a stable and predictable framework for the implementation of the EU budget and for the planning of EU policies.
The MFF sets the annual ceilings for expenditure for the different headings of the EU budget. These ceilings are based on the EU’s priorities and objectives. They are used to determine the appropriations for expenditure (commitments and payments) for each of the headings.
The MFF also sets the own-resources ceiling, which limits the total amount of own resources that can be collected from the EU countries.
The MFF also provides for a number of specific instruments to ensure the flexibility of the MFF. These instruments are the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the global margin for commitments for growth and employment, in particular youth employment.
When does the MFF apply?
The MFF applies from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
Revision of the MFF
The MFF may be revised in compliance with the own-resources ceiling set in Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom.
The Commission may present a proposal for revision of the MFF in the event of unforeseen circumstances that cannot be dealt with within the ceilings established as part of the MFF. It may also present such a proposal in the event of enlargement of the EU, of the revision of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), or of the reunification of Cyprus.
The MFF may also be revised in the event of:
—
an implementation of the budget;
—
measures linking effectiveness of funds to sound economic governance;
—
a revision of the TFEU;
—
an enlargement of the EU;
—
a reunification of Cyprus.

Summary 86:
Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making
SUMMARY
Better law-making is the aim of this Interinstitutional Agreement. The agreement was signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 13 April 2016. It sets out a number of measures which the three institutions will take to improve the quality of EU legislation.
WHAT DOES THIS AGREEMENT DO?
It sets out a number of measures which the three institutions will take to improve the quality of EU legislation.
KEY POINTS
The three institutions agree to pursue better law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures, as set out in this agreement.
In exercising their powers and in compliance with the procedures laid down in the Treaties, and recalling the importance which they attach to the Community method, the three institutions agree to observe general principles of Union law, such as democratic legitimacy, subsidiarity and proportionality, and legal certainty.
They further agree to promote simplicity, clarity and consistency in the drafting of Union legislation and to promote the utmost transparency of the legislative process.
The Commission will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council respectively, both before and after the adoption of its annual Work Programme (the Annual Programming – Commission Work Programme and interinstitutional programming).
Following the adoption of the Commission Work Programme and drawing on it, the three institutions will exchange views on initiatives for the coming year and agree on a joint declaration on annual interinstitutional programming (the joint declaration), to be signed by the presidents of the three institutions.
The three institutions will monitor, on a regular basis throughout the year, the implementation of the joint declaration.
To that end, the three institutions will participate in debates on the implementation of the joint declaration in the European Parliament and/or the Council during the spring of the year in question.
The Commission Work Programme will include major legislative and non-legislative proposals for the following year, including repeals, recasts, simplifications and withdrawals.
The Commission will take due account of, and respond to, the co-legislators' positions.
The Commission will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of its Work Programme for the year in question.
The three institutions agree on the positive contribution of impact assessments in improving the quality of Union legislation. Impact assessments are a tool to help the three institutions reach well-informed decisions and not a substitute for political decisions within the democratic decision-making process. Impact assessments should cover the existence, scale and consequences of a problem and the question whether or not Union action is needed.
The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality should be fully respected, as should fundamental rights.
Impact assessments should also address, whenever possible, the ‘cost of non-Europe’ and the impact on competitiveness and the administrative burdens of the different options, having particular regard to SMEs (‘Think Small First’), digital aspects and territorial impact.
The Commission will carry out impact assessments of its legislative and non-legislative initiatives, delegated acts and implementing measures which are expected to have significant economic, environmental or social impacts.
The European Parliament and the Council will, when they consider this to be appropriate and necessary for the legislative process, carry out impact assessments in relation to their substantial amendments to the Commission's proposal.
The Commission may, on its own initiative or upon invitation by the European Parliament or the Council, complement its own impact assessment or undertake other analytical work it considers necessary.
The three institutions are responsible for determining how to organise their impact assessment work, including internal organisational resources and quality control.
Public and stakeholder consultation is integral to well-informed decision-making and to improving the quality of law-making.
Without prejudice to the specific arrangements applying to the Commission's proposals under Article 155(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission will, before adopting a proposal, conduct public consultations in an open and transparent way, ensuring that the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation. The Commission will in particular encourage the direct participation of SMEs and other end-users in the consultations. This will include public internet-based consultations.
The results of public and stakeholder consultations shall be communicated without delay to both co-legislators and made public.
Ex-post evaluation of existing legislation
The three institutions confirm the importance of the greatest possible consistency and coherence in organising their work to evaluate the performance of Union legislation, including related public and stakeholder consultations. The Commission's evaluation planning will respect the timing for reports and reviews set out in Union legislation. Where appropriate, such requirements can include measurable indicators as a basis on which to collect evidence of the effects of legislation on the ground. The three institutions shall inform each other in good time before adopting or revising their guidelines concerning their tools for Better Law-Making (public and stakeholder consultations, impact assessments and ex-post evaluations).
The Commission will provide, in relation to each proposal, an explanation and justification to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding its choice of legal basis and type of legal act in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal.
The three institutions agree that the choice of legal basis is a legal determination that must be made on objective grounds which are amenable to judicial review. The Commission shall continue to fully play its institutional role to ensure that the Treaties and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union are respected.
The three institutions underline the important role played by delegated and implementing acts in Union law. It is the competence of the legislator to decide whether and to what extent to use delegated or implementing acts, within the limits of the Treaties.
The three institutions have agreed on a Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and on the related standard clauses (the Common Understanding), annexed hereto.
In accordance with the Common Understanding and with a view to enhancing transparency and consultation, the Commission commits to gathering, prior to the adoption of delegated acts, all necessary expertise, including through the consultation of Member States' experts and through public consultations.
Experts from the European Parliament and from the Council shall systematically have access to the meetings of Commission expert groups to which Member States' experts are invited and which concern the preparation of delegated acts.
The Commission may be invited to meetings in the European Parliament or the Council in order to have a further exchange of views on the preparation of delegated acts.
The Commission will carry out its role as facilitator by treating the two branches of the legislative authority equally, in full respect of the roles assigned by the Treaties to the three institutions. The three institutions will keep each other regularly informed throughout the legislative process about their work, about on-going negotiations among them and about any stakeholder feedback that they may receive, via appropriate procedures, including dialogue between them.
To that end, in the context of the legislative process, they will facilitate mutual exchange of views and information, including by inviting representatives of the other institutions to informal exchanges of views on a regular basis.
The European Parliament and the Council will, in the interest of efficiency, ensure a better synchronisation of their treatment of legislative proposals.
The three institutions agree to coordinate efforts to accelerate the legislative process while ensuring that the prerogatives of the co-legislators are respected and that the quality of legislation is preserved.
The three institutions acknowledge the importance of ensuring that each Institution can exercise its rights and fulfil its obligations enshrined in the Treaties as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements.
The three institutions

Internal Market Information System (IMI)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the Internal Market Information System (IMI) which facilitates administrative cooperation between EU countries.
KEY POINTS
The IMI is a secure online platform that allows EU countries’ competent authorities to exchange information and data. It is available in all official EU languages.
The IMI is available to competent authorities of EU countries as well as the European Commission. It is designed to support the implementation of EU legislation on administrative cooperation in the internal market.
The IMI helps the competent authorities to identify their counterpart in another EU country, to manage the exchange of information and to overcome language barriers. It also allows the competent authorities to overcome language barriers by providing pre-defined and pre-translated workflows.
The Commission is responsible for the IMI’s technical management, the security of the system and the training and technical assistance to the IMI users.
The Commission is also responsible for the appointment of the national IMI coordinators, as well as for the registration of the IMI coordinators and the competent authorities in the IMI.
The IMI may be expanded in the future to new areas, where it can help to ensure effective implementation of a Union act in a cost-efficient, user-friendly way, taking account of technical feasibility and overall impact on IMI.
The IMI was first established in 2011 to facilitate the posting of workers in the internal market.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies since 5 July 2015.
BACKGROUND
The IMI was first established in 2011 to facilitate the posting of workers in the internal market. It was then expanded to support administrative cooperation in other areas of the internal market, such as consumer protection, energy and taxation.
The Commission is planning to expand the IMI to other areas, where it can help to ensure effective implementation of a Union act in a cost-efficient, user-friendly way, taking account of technical feasibility and overall impact on IMI.

Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 on the creation of unitary patent protection
Uniform patent protection within the internal market, or at least a significant part thereof, should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It implements enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, authorised by Decision 2011/167/EU.
KEY POINTS
The unitary patent protection system is designed to facilitate access to patent protection and to make the patent system less costly and legally secure.
It is designed to cover all the participating Member States.
A European patent granted with the same set of claims in respect of all the participating Member States shall benefit from unitary effect in the participating Member States provided that its unitary effect has been registered in the Register for unitary patent protection.
A European patent with unitary effect shall have a unitary character. It shall provide uniform protection and shall have equal effect in all the participating Member States. It may only be limited, transferred or revoked, or lapse, in respect of all the participating Member States. It may be licensed in respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating Member States.
The unitary effect of a European patent shall be deemed not to have arisen to the extent that the European patent has been revoked or limited.
A European patent with unitary effect shall take effect in the participating Member States on the date of publication by the EPO of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin.
The participating Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where the unitary effect of a European patent has been registered and extends to their territory, that European patent is deemed not to have taken effect as a national patent in their territory on the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin.
The rights conferred by a European patent with unitary effect shall not extend to acts concerning a product covered by that patent which are carried out within the participating Member States in which that patent has unitary effect after that product has been placed on the market in the Union by, or with the consent of, the patent proprietor, unless there are legitimate grounds for the patent proprietor to oppose further commercialisation of the product.
A European patent with unitary effect as an object of property shall be treated in its entirety and in all the participating Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary effect and in which, according to the European Patent Register:
—
the applicant had his residence or principal place of business on the date of filing of the application for the European patent; or
—
where point (a) does not apply, the applicant had a place of business on the date of filing of the application for the European patent.
The participating Member States shall ensure compliance with this Regulation in fulfilling their international obligations undertaken in the EPC and shall cooperate to that end. To that end they shall set up a select committee of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation (hereinafter ‘Select Committee’) within the meaning of Article 145 of the EPC.
The Select Committee shall consist of the representatives of the participating Member States and a representative of the Commission as an observer, as well as alternates who will represent them in their absence. The members of the Select Committee may be assisted by advisers or experts.
The participating Member States shall ensure effective legal protection before a competent court of one or several participating Member States against the decisions of the EPO in carrying out the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.
The expenses incurred by the EPO in carrying out the additional tasks given to it, within the meaning of Article 143 of the EPC, by the participating Member States shall be covered by the fees generated by the European patents with unitary effect. Renewal fees for European patents with unitary effect and additional fees for their late payment shall be paid to the European Patent Organisation by the patent proprietor.
A European patent with unitary effect shall lapse if a renewal fee and, where applicable, any additional fee have not been paid in due time.
The level of renewal fees shall be set at a level that:
—
is equivalent to the level of the renewal fee to be paid for the average geographical coverage of current European patents;
—
reflects the renewal rate of current European patents; and
—
reflects the number of requests for unitary effect.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It entered into force on 19 December 2012.
It applies from 1 January 2014 or the date of entry into force of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (the ‘Agreement’), whichever is the later.

SUMMARY
The EU-Central America Trade Agreement (CAE) aims to strengthen political and economic relations between the EU and Central America. The agreement sets up a free trade area, but also includes rules on trade defence measures and the environment and social aspects of trade.
The CAE provides for a bilateral safeguard clause and a stabilisation mechanism for bananas, which are implemented through this regulation.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules and procedures for the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the CAE.
KEY POINTS
The bilateral safeguard clause
The bilateral safeguard clause may be applied where imports of a product originating in Central America are imported into the EU in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the EU industry.
The safeguard measures may take one of the following forms:
—
a suspension of a further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for in the Tariff Elimination Schedule;
—
an increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of:
—
the most-favoured-nation (MFN) applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or
—
the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the Agreement.
The Commission must monitor the evolution of import statistics of bananas from Central American countries and may decide to adopt prior surveillance measures in regard to imports from a Central American country where:
—
the trend in imports of a product is such that it could lead to one of the situations referred to in Articles 2 and 4; or
—
there is a surge of imports of bananas concentrated in one or several Member States, or in one or several of the EU’s outermost regions.
The Commission may adopt prior surveillance measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(2) of this regulation.
The Commission may adopt provisional safeguard measures in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 14(4) of this regulation in cases of imperative grounds of urgency, including the case referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 7 of this regulation.
The Commission may adopt definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 14(3) of this regulation where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) of this regulation are met.

The Commission may adopt definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 14(3) of this regulation where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) of this regulation are met.
The duration and review of safeguard measures
A safeguard measure may be imposed only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the EU industry and to facilitate adjustment. That period may not exceed 2 years, unless it is extended under paragraph 3.
A safeguard measure may be imposed only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious deterioration in the economic situation of one or several of the EU’s outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 TFEU. That period may not exceed 2 years, unless it is extended under paragraph 3.
The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may be extended by up to 2 years provided that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to the EU industry and that there is evidence that the EU industry is adjusting.
The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed 4 years, including any provisional safeguard measure.
No safeguard measure may be applied to the import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure, unless a period of time equal to half of that during which the safeguard measure was applied for the immediately preceding period has elapsed.
The stabilisation mechanism for bananas
A separate annual trigger import volume is set for imports of products falling under heading 0803 00 19 of the Combined Nomenclature (fresh bananas, excluding plantains) and listed under category ‘ST’ in the Tariff Elimination Schedule.
The importation of the products referred to in paragraph 1 at the preferential customs duty rate shall be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the competent authority of the Republic of the Central American country from which the products are exported.
Where the Commission decides to suspend the preferential customs duty applicable, it may apply the lesser of the base rate of customs duty or the MFN rate of duty that in application at the time such action is taken.
The measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 shall be applicable only during the period ending on 31 December 2019.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from the date of application of the Agreement.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1219/2012 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public procurement contracts and concessions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to set out the rules on the status of bilateral investment agreements (BIAs) concluded by EU countries with non-EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all BIAs concluded by EU countries with non-EU countries. It does not cover agreements concluded between EU countries.
BIAs
A BIA is an agreement between an EU country and a non-EU country that contains provisions on investment protection. This regulation covers only those provisions of BIAs dealing with investment protection.
BIAs that EU countries sign before 1 December 2009 or before the date of their accession to the EU, whichever is later, may be maintained in force or enter into force, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and this regulation.
EU countries may be authorised to amend or conclude BIAs with non-EU countries, provided that they comply with certain conditions.
EU countries must take the necessary measures to eliminate any incompatibilities with EU law contained in BIAs concluded between them and non-EU countries.
The European Commission may assess BIAs notified by EU countries under this regulation to evaluate whether one or more of their provisions constitute a serious obstacle to the negotiation or conclusion by the EU of BIAs with non-EU countries.
The Commission may request additional information from the EU country concerned to carry out its assessment.
If the Commission establishes that one or more of the provisions of a BIA constitute a serious obstacle to the negotiation or conclusion by the EU of BIAs with non-EU countries, the Commission and the EU country concerned must enter into consultations.
The Commission may, within 60 days of the end of the consultations, indicate the appropriate measures to be taken by the EU country concerned in order to remove the obstacles.

Summary 103:
EU trade preferences for developing countries
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) offers special trade preferences to developing countries. These preferences are designed to support their economic development and help them to fight poverty.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the conditions under which developing countries can benefit from the EU’s special trade preferences.
KEY POINTS
The special trade preferences are based on the following arrangements:
the generalised system of preferences (GSP) for developing countries;
the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change;
the special arrangement for the least developed countries (LDC);
the special arrangement for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states.
The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country has ratified and effectively implements a minimum number of relevant international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance;
the country has ratified and effectively implements the relevant conventions’ reporting obligations and conclusions and recommendations of the relevant monitoring bodies;
the country has effectively implemented its binding undertakings as referred to in the relevant conventions;
the country has not formulated any reservation which is prohibited by any of the relevant conventions or which is incompatible with the object and purpose of that convention.
The special arrangement for the least developed countries (LDC) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is a least-developed country according to the United Nations classification;
the country’s per capita income is below the threshold set by the World Bank;
the country’s level of diversification is low, as measured by the vulnerability threshold;
the country’s economy is not able to sustain the higher level of diversification that the scheme would allow.
The special arrangement for the ACP states is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is an ACP country;
the country is not eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+).
The generalised system of preferences (GSP) is granted to a country if it meets the following conditions:
the country has made a request to that effect;
the country is not eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+).
The regulation applies to all products except for agricultural products listed in Annex I.
The scheme is based on the following principles:
graduation, which means that if a country meets the conditions to be eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+), it will benefit from the additional tariff preferences. Graduation will take effect 5 years after the date of application of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+);

double hulls for oil tankers
SUMMARY
EU legislation aims to ensure that oil tankers entering into ports and offshore terminals or anchoring in an area under the jurisdiction of Member States comply with the double hull design requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78).
WHAT INFORMATION DOES THIS REGULATION PROVIDE?
It lays down an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements of MARPOL 73/78 to single-hull oil tankers.
It bans the transport of heavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all oil tankers of 5 000 tonnes deadweight and above:
flying the flag of an EU country;
entering or leaving a port or offshore terminal or anchoring in an area under the jurisdiction of an EU country.
For the purposes of this regulation, an ‘oil tanker’ means any ship constructed or retrofitted to carry oil in bulk as cargo and includes, inter alia, oil tankers, combination carriers and product carriers.
The regulation does not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship, owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service. The Member States undertake to respect this provision as far as is reasonable and practicable.
No oil tanker shall be allowed to operate under the flag of an EU country, nor shall any oil tanker, irrespective of its flag, be allowed to enter into ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of an EU country unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker carrying heavy grade oil shall be allowed to fly the flag of an EU country unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker carrying heavy grade oil, irrespective of its flag, shall be allowed to enter or leave ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of an EU country, unless such tanker is a double-hull oil tanker.
No oil tanker, irrespective of its flag, shall be allowed to enter or leave ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of an EU country unless such tanker complies with the condition assessment scheme (CAS) referred to in the regulation.
For the purposes of the regulation, the CAS adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2003 shall apply.
After the anniversary of the date of delivery of the ship in 2015, the following shall no longer be allowed:
the continued operation, in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78, of Category 2 and Category 3 oil tankers under the flag of an EU country;
the entry into the ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of an EU country of other Category 2 and Category 3 oil tankers, irrespective of the fact that they continue to operate under the flag of a third country in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
Each EU country shall inform the IMO of its decision to deny entry to oil tankers, pursuant to Article 7 of this regulation, operating in accordance with Regulation 20.5 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78 into the ports or offshore terminals under its jurisdiction, on the basis of Regulation 20.8.2 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
Each EU country shall notify the IMO if it allows, suspends, withdraws or declines the operation of a Category 1 or a Category 2 oil tanker entitled to fly its flag, in accordance with Article 5 of this regulation, on the basis of Regulation 20.8.1 of Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 20 July 2012.
BACKGROUND
              
The EU is concerned about shipping accidents involving oil tankers and the associated pollution of its coastlines and harm to its fauna and flora and other marine resources.
The EU is also concerned about the safety of its citizens and the environment and has therefore adopted a number of measures to ensure that its waters are clean and safe.
For further information, please see the European Commission’s website on the prevention of oil pollution.

Summary 110:
Regulation on the freedom of movement for workers within the EU
SUMMARY
This Regulation establishes a legal framework for the free movement of workers within the European Union (EU). It states that any national of an EU country has the right to take up an activity as an employed person and to pursue such activity in the territory of another EU country. This right is granted under the same conditions as the nationals of that country. In addition, this Regulation sets out the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a legal framework for the free movement of workers within the European Union (EU) and the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
It also states that any national of an EU country has the right to take up an activity as an employed person and to pursue such activity in the territory of another EU country. This right is granted under the same conditions as the nationals of that country.
KEY POINTS
The right to pursue an activity as an employed person is granted without discrimination by permanent, seasonal and frontier workers and by those who pursue their activities for the purpose of providing services.
The right of freedom of movement, in order that it may be exercised, by objective standards, in freedom and dignity, requires that equality of treatment be ensured in fact and in law in respect of all matters relating to the actual pursuit of activities as employed persons and to eligibility for housing, and also that obstacles to the mobility of workers be eliminated, in particular as regards the conditions for the integration of the worker’s family into the host country.
The principle of non-discrimination between workers in the EU means that all nationals of EU countries have the same priority as regards employment as is enjoyed by national workers.
The machinery for vacancy clearance, in particular by means of direct cooperation between the central employment services and also between the regional services, as well as by coordination of the exchange of information, ensures in a general way a clearer picture of the labour market.
Workers wishing to move should also be regularly informed of living and working conditions.
Close links exist between freedom of movement for workers, employment and vocational training, particularly where the latter aims at putting workers in a position to take up concrete offers of employment from other regions of the EU. Such links make it necessary that the problems arising in this connection should no longer be studied in isolation but viewed as interdependent, account also being taken of the problems of employment at the regional level. It is therefore necessary to direct the efforts of Member States toward coordinating their employment policies.
The right of all workers in the Member States to pursue the activity of their choice within the EU should be affirmed.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It has applied since 8 November 1968.
BACKGROUND
The free movement of workers is one of the pillars of the European Union (EU). It is one of the fundamental rights of citizens of the EU, which allows them to work in any EU country. The free movement of workers constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their families.
For further information, please see the European Commission's website on the free movement of workers.

EU eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the conditions for organisations to participate in the EU’s eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), a voluntary instrument that allows them to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the conditions for organisations to participate in the EU’s eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), a voluntary instrument that allows them to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection.
The regulation applies to organisations which carry out activities that have a significant environmental impact, regardless of their size or sector.
Organisations may register with the competent authorities in their respective EU countries.
Registration requires them to:
develop an environmental policy;
carry out an initial environmental review;
develop and implement an environmental management system;
establish environmental objectives and targets;
comply with applicable legal requirements relating to the environment;
publish an environmental statement;
implement an internal environmental audit;
have their environmental statement validated by an accredited environmental verifier.
Registered organisations are entitled to use the EMAS logo and the ‘EMAS registered’ wording.
EU countries are encouraged to reduce the administrative burden of registered organisations by way of deregulation or regulatory relief.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2015.
BACKGROUND
The EU’s eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) is a voluntary instrument that allows organisations to demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection. It is a practical tool that can be used to improve environmental performance and competitiveness.
It was established by Regulation (EC) No 761/2001.
In 2013, the European Commission launched a review of EMAS. The Commission’s main conclusions were that EMAS is a good instrument for improving environmental performance and competitiveness. It should be made available to all organisations, in and outside the EU, whose activities have an environmental impact.
In 2015, the Commission adopted a new regulation on EMAS to ensure that it is more accessible and easier to use. The regulation was amended in 2017.

Summary 118:
Fighting against false documents
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) is facing an increasing number of false documents and identity fraud. The FADO system (Fight Against Document Fraud) was created in 1998 to help police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities in the EU to fight against these forms of fraud.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It updates the FADO system, which is a European database of information on authentic documents and methods of falsification. It is intended to contribute to the fight against document fraud and identity fraud.
KEY POINTS
The FADO system contains information on:
travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licences and vehicle licences issued by EU countries or by the EU;
false versions of such documents;
other related official documents, in particular those used in support of applications for official documents, issued by EU countries or by third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;
false versions of such documents and other related official documents.
The FADO system may contain other useful information, such as:
handbooks;
contact lists;
recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of falsification;
valid travel documents and their recognition by EU countries.
EU countries and the EU must transmit without delay the information on the documents referred to in the first paragraph to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the Agency).
EU countries may transmit to the Agency the information on the documents referred to in the second and third paragraphs.
Third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law, may transmit to the Agency the information on the documents referred to in the second and third paragraphs.
The Agency must ensure the proper and reliable functioning of the FADO system and provide support to the competent EU authorities in the detection of false documents.
The FADO system provides users with different levels of access to information. The Commission and the Agency, to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks, and the competent EU authorities, such as police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities, have secure access to the FADO system on a need-to-know basis. The following actors may obtain access to information stored in the FADO system in a limited manner:
the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies;
third parties, such as third countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;
private entities, such as airlines and other carriers.
The Commission adopts delegated acts in order to establish measures granting access to information stored in the FADO system to the actors listed above.
EU countries determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud and other relevant national authorities are to have access to the FADO system, including the level of access with which they are to be provided, and notify the Commission and the Agency thereof.
The Agency must apply Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council when processing personal data under this regulation. It must ensure that technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, are in place in order to ensure that personal data are only processed to the extent strictly necessary for the purpose of operating the FADO system.
The Commission adopts implementing acts in order to:
establish the technical architecture of the FADO system;
establish the technical specifications for entering and storing information in the FADO system in accordance with high standards;
establish the procedures for controlling and verifying the information contained in the FADO system;
determine the date of the effective implementation of the FADO system by the Agency.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 26 April 2020.
BACKGROUND
The FADO system was created in 1998 to help police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities in the EU to fight against these forms of fraud.
The FADO system contributes to maintaining a high level of security within the EU by supporting police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities of the EU countries in the fight against document fraud, in particular at the external borders. Given that the detection of false documents is also important for citizens, organisations and businesses, the General Secretariat of the Council also made authentic documents available in a Public Register of Authentic Travel and Identity Documents Online, known as PRADO.

controls on cash entering and leaving the EU
SUMMARY
Cash is a commodity that can be used to launder the proceeds of crime or to finance terrorism. The EU is currently tightening controls on cash entering and leaving its territory.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It introduces a system of rules to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by regulating cash movements across the EU’s external borders.
KEY POINTS
Cash
Cash means:
currency (notes and coins);
bearer-negotiable instruments;
commodities used as highly-liquid stores of value (e.g. gold, silver, precious metals and gems);
prepaid cards.
Obligation to declare
Carriers who carry cash of a value of EUR 10 000 or more shall declare that cash to the competent authorities of the Member State through which they are entering or leaving the EU and make it available for control. The details shall be provided in writing or electronically, using the EU Cash Declaration Form (EU-CDF).
Obligation to disclose
The competent authorities may detain the cash until the sender or the recipient, or a representative thereof, makes the disclosure declaration. The disclosure declaration shall provide details about the following:
the declarant, including full name, contact details, including address, date and place of birth, nationality and passport details;
the cash, including its type, its quantity and value, its economic provenance and intended use;
the sender and, where available, the intended recipient of the cash, including full name, contact details, including address and date of birth.
Controls
The competent authorities shall have the power to carry out controls on natural persons, their luggage and their means of transport, in accordance with the conditions laid down in national law. The controls shall be based primarily on risk analysis, with the purpose of identifying and evaluating the risks and developing the necessary countermeasures, and shall be performed within a common risk management framework in accordance with the criteria established by the Commission and the FIUs under Directive (EU) 2015/849.
Sub-threshold amounts suspected to be related to criminal activity
Where the competent authorities find that unaccompanied cash below the threshold is entering or leaving the EU and that there are indications that the cash is related to criminal activity, they shall record that information and the details listed in Article 4(2).
Temporary detention of cash by competent authorities
The competent authorities may temporarily detain cash by means of an administrative decision in accordance with the conditions laid down in national law where:
the obligation to declare accompanied cash under Article 3 or the obligation to disclose unaccompanied cash under Article 4 has not been fulfilled; or
there are indications that the cash, irrespective of the amount, is related to criminal activity.
The period of temporary detention shall be strictly limited under national law to the time required for competent authorities to determine whether the circumstances of the case warrant further detention. The period of temporary detention shall not exceed 30 days.
Provision of information to the FIU
The competent authorities shall transmit the information obtained under Article 3 or 4, where there are indications that the cash is related to criminal activity, to the FIU of the Member State in question. The FIU shall exchange such information with the relevant FIUs of the other Member States in accordance with Article 53(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
The competent authorities shall transmit the following information to the competent authorities of all the other Member States:
ex officio declarations composed under Article 5(3);
information obtained under Article 6;
declarations obtained under Article 3 or 4, where there are indications that the cash is related to criminal activity;
anonymised risk information and risk analysis results.
The information shall be transmitted as soon as possible, and in any event no later than 15 working days after the date on which that information was obtained.
Personal data protection and retention periods
The processing of personal data on the basis of this Regulation shall take place only for the purposes of the prevention and fight against criminal activities. The personal data shall be erased upon the expiry of a period of 5 years.
Penalties

SUMMARY
Accessible format copies of books and other printed material which are protected by copyright and related rights are an essential means for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled to access culture and information. The Marrakesh Treaty, which the European Union ratified in 2014, provides for exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights for the making and dissemination of copies, in accessible formats, of certain works and other subject matter, and for the cross-border exchange of those copies. The Marrakesh Treaty also provides for exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights for the making and dissemination of copies, in accessible formats, of certain works and other subject matter, and for the cross-border exchange of those copies. This Regulation aims to ensure that accessible format copies of books, including e-books, journals, newspapers, magazines and other kinds of writing, notation, including sheet music, and other printed material, including in audio form, which have been made in any Member State in accordance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564 can be distributed, communicated, or made available, to a beneficiary person or authorised entity, as referred to in the Marrakesh Treaty, in third countries that are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty. Accessible formats include, for example, Braille, large print, adapted e-books, audio books and radio broadcasts.
KEY POINTS
What does the Regulation provide for?
An authorised entity established in a Member State may distribute, communicate or make available to beneficiary persons as one of its primary activities, institutional obligations or as part of its public-interest missions, an accessible format copy of a work or other subject matter made in accordance with the national legislation adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564.
A beneficiary person or an authorised entity established in a Member State may import or otherwise obtain or access and thereafter use, in accordance with the national legislation adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564, an accessible format copy of a work or other subject matter that has been distributed, communicated or made available to beneficiary persons or to authorised entities, by an authorised entity in a third country that is a party to the Marrakesh Treaty.
An authorised entity established in a Member State shall establish and follow the practices referred to in the first subparagraph in full respect of the rules applicable to the processing of personal data of beneficiary persons referred to in Article 6.
The processing of personal data carried out within the framework of this Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC.

Summary 133:
rules on the issuance of euro coins
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1278/2012 on euro coins
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It introduces binding rules for the issuance of euro coins.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all euro coins intended for circulation, which have the status of legal tender in all euro area Member States, and to collector coins, which have the status of legal tender only in the Member State of issuance.
Circulation coins
Circulation coins may be put into circulation at face value or above face value, but only if the special quality of the coin, the special packaging or any additional services provided justify the higher price.
The total number of circulation coins put into circulation for each individual issue may not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the total number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States;
1% of the total number of 1- and 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States.
Commemorative coins
Each euro area Member State may only issue 2 commemorative coins per year, except where:
commemorative coins are collectively issued by all euro area Member States; or
a commemorative coin is issued on the occasion of a temporary vacancy or a provisional occupation of the function of Head of State.
The total number of commemorative coins put into circulation for each individual issue may not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the total number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States;
1% of the total number of 1- and 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States.
Collector coins
Collector coins may be put on the market at or above face value.
The issuances of collector coins are accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2013.
BACKGROUND
              
The issuance of euro coins is currently governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 and Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98. However, the lack of mandatory provisions for the issuance of euro coins may result in different practices among euro area Member States and does not achieve a sufficiently integrated framework for the single currency.
The regulation is part of a package of measures to reform the monetary system of the European Union.
It introduces binding rules for the issuance of euro coins and sets limits on the issuance of commemorative coins and collector coins.

It aims to establish the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the period 2014-2020.
KEY POINTS
The EMFF is part of the European Union’s (EU) cohesion policy. It is one of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) set up to reduce disparities between EU regions and improve the standard of living and employment prospects of EU citizens.
The EMFF supports the development of the EU’s maritime and fisheries sector and the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP).
The EMFF has 3 objectives:
to promote competitive, environmentally sustainable, economically viable and socially responsible fisheries and aquaculture;
to foster the implementation of the CFP;
to foster a balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries and aquaculture areas.
The EMFF is financed through the EU’s annual budget.
The EU’s financial assistance under the EMFF is disbursed in accordance with the principle of shared management. The EU and the EU countries jointly manage the EMFF. The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is €7.1 billion over the 2014-2020 period.
The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is subject to a performance-based management system, which is based on the results achieved in the fisheries sector and the maritime economy. The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is paid out in annual instalments. The Commission pays the EMFF to the EU countries which in turn pay the EMFF to the beneficiaries.
The EMFF supports the following measures:
competitiveness of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors;
fostering the implementation of the CFP;
sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture areas;
the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy;
the European Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.

Summary 149:
rules for the internal gas market
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down basic principles and rules for access to and use of gas networks, including gas storage facilities and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, in order to ensure that the gas market operates in a fair, transparent and efficient manner.
It also establishes a European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) to promote the completion and functioning of the internal market in natural gas and cross-border trade, and to ensure the optimal management, coordinated operation and sound technical evolution of the natural gas transmission network.
KEY POINTS
The ENTSOG is composed of the national transmission system operators (TSOs) in the EU. It is responsible for developing and implementing network codes, non-binding ten-year network development plans and annual work programmes, and for coordinating and promoting regional cooperation structures.
TSOs are responsible for developing and implementing non-binding guidelines and harmonised contracts for the internal market in gas. They are also responsible for implementing the network codes and for providing network users with information on tariffs, capacity and physical status of the network.
TSOs must make available their transmission systems to all users on a non-discriminatory basis. They must develop and implement transparent and non-discriminatory balancing systems and transparent, non-discriminatory congestion-management procedures. They must also ensure the physical integrity of the gas transmission network.
TSOs must ensure the provision of third-party access services on the basis of harmonised transport contracts, which provide for the availability of short-term and long-term capacity, as well as for the possibility of reselling or subletting contracted capacity.
TSOs must provide network users with information on tariffs, capacity and physical status of the network. They must also provide network users with information on balancing, congestion-management and capacity-allocation mechanisms.
The Commission has adopted 6 network codes:
Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management
Security of Gas Supply
Guidelines for System Integrity and System Restoration
Guidelines for Harmonised Transmission Tariffs
Guidelines for Security of Supply and Integrity of Electricity Systems
Guidelines for Electricity Balancing.
FROM WHEN DO THE RULES APPLY?
The regulation applies from 3 May 2010.
BACKGROUND
The internal gas market is not yet fully integrated. The regulation seeks to further develop the internal gas market in order to ensure that it operates in a fair, transparent and efficient manner.
The regulation is one of the measures adopted by the EU to establish the single market for gas.

Summary 155:
safety and transparency in the settlement of financial transactions
SUMMARY
SETTLEMENT OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Settlement of financial transactions plays a key role in the financial markets. It is the process that transfers ownership of securities from the seller to the buyer.
The settlement process is complex and involves several players, such as banks, investment firms, central securities depositories (CSDs) and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs). In the absence of uniform rules, this has led to a fragmentation of the settlement process across the EU. This Regulation aims to ensure the safety and transparency of the settlement process for financial transactions in the EU.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules on the settlement of financial transactions and on the activities of CSDs, which operate securities settlement systems.
KEY POINTS
Settlement of financial transactions
The Regulation lays down rules on the settlement of financial transactions in order to ensure the safety and transparency of the settlement process.
The Regulation applies to the settlement of all financial instruments, such as transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, unless otherwise specified in the Regulation.
The Regulation requires CSDs to ensure the timely settlement of securities transactions and the integrity of the securities issue. The Regulation also requires CSDs to monitor settlement fails, which are transactions that have not been settled on the intended settlement date. It also establishes rules for the buy-in and the sell-out procedures to address settlement fails.
Activities of CSDs
The Regulation also lays down rules on the activities of CSDs. CSDs must provide certain core services, which consist of settlement, implying the operation of a securities settlement system, notary and central securities accounts maintenance services.
CSDs must also provide certain ancillary services, such as custody, safe custody and sub-custody services, which contribute to enhancing the safety, efficiency and transparency of the securities markets.
The Regulation also lays down rules on the authorisation and supervision of CSDs. CSDs are subject to authorisation and supervision by competent authorities in the EU. The competent authorities are responsible for ensuring that CSDs comply with the requirements of the Regulation. They may impose administrative penalties and other measures in the event of non-compliance with the Regulation.
The Regulation establishes a system of recognition for third-country CSDs, which are CSDs established outside the EU. Third-country CSDs that intend to provide certain services or to set up a branch in the EU must be recognised by ESMA. The Regulation also lays down rules on the application of the prudential requirements applicable to CSDs.
The Regulation contains rules on the capital requirements of CSDs and of credit institutions that are part of the same group of undertakings as a CSD.
The Regulation lays down rules on the law applicable to proprietary aspects in relation to the securities held in the accounts maintained by CSDs.
The Regulation provides that CSDs may provide services in other Member States, including through setting up a branch. It lays down rules on the authorisation and supervision of CSDs operating in other Member States.
The Regulation establishes a system of recognition for third-country CSDs that intend to provide certain services or to set up a branch in the EU.
The Regulation lays down rules on the cooperation between competent authorities.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 9 January 2015.
BACKGROUND
The settlement process is complex and involves several players, such as banks, investment firms, central securities depositories (CSDs) and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs). In the absence of uniform rules, this has led to a fragmentation of the settlement process across the EU.

Summary 158:
European territorial cooperation goal
SUMMARY
This Regulation establishes the scope of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal and lays down specific provisions concerning that goal.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the scope of the ERDF with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal and lays down specific provisions concerning that goal.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The European territorial cooperation goal covers cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
The scope of the ERDF with regard to the European territorial cooperation goal includes:
cross-border cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions in different Member States;
transnational cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions within the same Member State;
interregional cooperation, which covers cooperation between regions in different Member States.
Cross-border cooperation
The regions to be supported for cross-border cooperation are the NUTS level 3 regions* of the European Union along all internal and external land borders other than those covered by programmes under the external financial instruments of the Union, and all NUTS level 3 regions of the Union along maritime borders separated by a maximum of 150 km.
The Commission adopts a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the list of cross-border areas to receive support, broken down by cooperation programme.
Transnational cooperation
The European territorial cooperation goal also covers transnational cooperation programmes, which aim to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion policy priorities, and which also include maritime cross-border cooperation not covered by cross-border cooperation programmes.
Interregional cooperation
The European territorial cooperation goal also covers interregional cooperation programmes, which aim to reinforce the effectiveness of cohesion policy by developing and testing new approaches and good practices in the fields of territorial development and cooperation.
Resources for European territorial cooperation goal
The outermost regions* are allocated not less than 150 % of the ERDF support they received in the 2007-2013 programming period for cooperation programmes.
Each Member State receives an allocation from the ERDF, broken down by cooperation programme, for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. Member States may use the flexibility between the components of the European territorial cooperation goal, and are encouraged to allocate at least 80 % of their allocation to cross-border cooperation.
Thematic concentration and investment priorities
At least 80 % of the ERDF allocation to each cross-border cooperation and transnational cooperation programme must be concentrated on a maximum of four of the thematic objectives set out in the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
The ERDF must also support cooperation between the Union and its neighbouring third countries, including through specific arrangements, in order to offset the higher administrative costs.
Cooperation programmes
Cooperation programmes must:
set out the objectives of the cooperation programme;
set out the priority axes and their objectives;
set out the actions to be implemented;
set out the indicators to be used to measure the progress of implementation;
set out the management and control systems;
set out the arrangements for the involvement of partners.
Monitoring and evaluation
The managing authority must submit annual implementation reports to the Commission, which must include information on:
the implementation of the cooperation programme;
the progress in preparation and implementation of major projects and joint action plans.
The Commission must assess the implementation reports and, if necessary, decide on the need for an interim review meeting.
Indicators for the European territorial cooperation goal
For common and programme-specific output indicators, baselines must be set at zero.
Technical assistance
The amount of the ERDF allocated to technical assistance must be limited to 6 % of the total amount allocated to a cooperation programme.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
              
The European territorial cooperation goal covers cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
Cross-border cooperation aims to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reduce the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
Transnational cooperation aims to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union's cohesion policy priorities, and aims to also include maritime cross-border cooperation not covered by cross-border cooperation programmes.
Interregional cooperation aims to reinforce the effectiveness of cohesion policy by developing and testing new approaches and good practices in the fields of territorial development and cooperation.

BACKGROUND
The European Commission's ‘Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond — A Blueprint for an integrated European energy network’ communication of 2011 called for a new energy infrastructure policy to optimise network development at European level for the period up to 2020 and beyond, in order to allow the Union to meet its core energy policy objectives of competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
The Commission has identified 12 strategic trans-European energy infrastructure priorities, the implementation of which by 2020 is essential for the achievement of the Union's energy and climate policy objectives.
The European Council of 4 February 2011 underlined the need to modernise and expand Europe's energy infrastructure and to interconnect networks across borders, in order to make solidarity between Member States operational, to provide for alternative supply or transit routes and sources of energy and to develop renewable energy sources in competition with traditional sources.
The European Council of 18 June 2011 called for the development of the Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) in order to contribute to the development of the internal market in energy and to the security of energy supply.
The European Council of 24-25 May 2012 called for a new European industrial policy, which includes a new energy infrastructure policy.

Summary 161:
2014-2020 direct payments: EU countries to get better value for their money
EU countries are to get better value for their money from direct payments to farmers from 2014 to 2020. The reform will ensure that the money goes to those farmers who need it most, while helping to protect the environment and rural areas.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for direct payments* to farmers under the common agricultural policy (CAP) from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
KEY POINTS
The reform of the CAP introduced in 2013 provides for a gradual reduction in direct payments and for the introduction of ‘greening’*, a new set of rules for farmers.
Direct payments
Direct payments are divided into 2 categories:
basic payments for farmers and
coupled support for young farmers, small farms and farms in less-favoured areas.
The basic payment scheme
Under the basic payment scheme, each farmer receives a flat rate for the area of his or her holding, regardless of the type of crops grown. This replaces the single payment scheme, which is abolished from 2014.
The basic payment scheme is a key instrument for the convergence of direct payments per hectare in the EU. It will be progressively adjusted to take account of the differences in the cost of production between Member States.
To ensure that the support is better targeted, Member States may decide not to grant direct payments to certain natural and legal persons unless such persons can demonstrate that their agricultural activity is not marginal.
EU countries may also decide to grant a reduction of direct payments to large beneficiaries. The proceeds of the reduction of payments to large beneficiaries are to be made available as support for rural development measures financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
The basic payment scheme is subject to certain conditions:
the payment is granted only to farmers who are active in farming;
the payment is granted only to farmers who are established in the EU;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not exceeded the ceiling fixed by the EU country;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme;
the payment is granted only to farmers who have not exceeded the ceiling fixed by the EU country for young farmers, small farms or farms in less-favoured areas.
Young farmers, small farms and farms in less-favoured areas
Farmers who are young, small or in less-favoured areas receive a coupled support, which is based on the area of their holding. The support is calculated as a flat rate per hectare of eligible land.
The support for young farmers is granted only to farmers who are under 40 years old, who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
The support for small farms is granted only to farmers who are not young and who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
The support for farms in less-favoured areas is granted only to farmers who are not young or small and who have received direct payments for the 2 preceding years and who have not received payments from the EU or from the EU country from another support scheme.
EU countries may decide to grant a reduction of direct payments to large beneficiaries. The proceeds of the reduction of payments to large beneficiaries are to be made available as support for rural development measures financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
EU countries may decide to transfer funds from their direct payments ceiling to their support assigned for rural development.
The EU country may decide to use part of its direct payments ceiling to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in areas with specific natural constraints.
EU countries may decide to use part of their direct payments ceiling to support the production of protein crops.
The EU country may decide to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in areas with specific natural constraints.
EU countries may decide to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in the following areas:
the outermost regions*;
the smaller Aegean islands*;
the mountainous regions*;
the islands*;
the regions suffering from serious difficulties*.

The service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU
The service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU
SUMMARY:
This Regulation establishes an area of freedom, security and justice in civil and commercial matters in the European Union (EU). It covers the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU.
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a system for the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in the EU. It provides for the transmission of judicial documents between the agencies designated by the EU Member States for this purpose. It also provides for the service of judicial documents in the Member States in which they are to be served.
KEY POINTS
The Regulation applies to the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters between Member States. It does not apply to revenue, customs or administrative matters or to liability of the State for actions or omissions in the exercise of state authority (acta iure imperii).
The Regulation does not apply where the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.
Each Member State designates the public officers, authorities or other persons competent for the transmission of judicial or extrajudicial documents to be served in another Member State and those competent for the receipt of judicial or extrajudicial documents from another Member State.
The designation has effect for a period of 5 years and may be renewed at 5-year intervals.
Each Member State provides the European Commission with the following information:
the names and addresses of the receiving agencies;
the geographical areas in which they have jurisdiction;
the means of receipt of documents available to them; and
the languages that may be used for the completion of the standard form.
The Commission is notified of any subsequent modification of such information.
The Commission publishes the information communicated in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Regulation provides for the transmission of judicial documents directly and as soon as possible between the agencies designated pursuant to Article 2.
The documents to be transmitted are accompanied by a standard form which is completed in the official language of the Member State addressed or in another language which that Member State has indicated it can accept.
The documents and all papers that are transmitted are exempted from legalisation or any equivalent formality.
The applicant is advised by the transmitting agency to which he forwards the document for transmission that the addressee may refuse to accept it if it is not in one of the languages provided for in Article 8.
The applicant bears any costs of translation prior to the transmission of the document.
On receipt of a document, a receiving agency sends, as soon as possible and in any event within 7 days of receipt, a receipt to the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means of transmission using the standard form set out in Annex I.
If the request for service cannot be fulfilled on the basis of the information or documents transmitted, the receiving agency contacts the transmitting agency by the swiftest possible means in order to secure the missing information or documents.
If the request for service is manifestly outside the scope of the Regulation or if non-compliance with the formal conditions required makes service impossible, the request and the documents transmitted are returned, on receipt, to the transmitting agency, together with the notice of return using the standard form set out in Annex I.
A receiving agency receiving a document for service but not having territorial jurisdiction to serve it forwards it, as well as the request, to the receiving agency having territorial jurisdiction in the same Member State if the request complies with the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) and informs the transmitting agency accordingly using the standard form set out in Annex I. That receiving agency informs the transmitting agency when it receives the document, in the manner provided for in paragraph 1.
The receiving agency serves the document or has it served either in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed or by a particular method requested by the transmitting agency, unless that method is incompatible with the law of that Member State.
The receiving agency takes all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within 1 month of receipt.
The receiving agency informs the addressee that he may refuse to accept the document at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within 1 week if it is not either in a language which he understands or in the official language or one of the official languages of the place of service. This rule also applies to service by diplomatic or consular agents, service by postal services and direct service. It is established that the service of the refused document can be remedied through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.
The receiving agency continues to take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document also in cases where it has not been possible to effect service within the month, for example, because the defendant has been away from his home on holiday or away from his office on business.
Where according to the law of a Member State a document has to be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant is that determined by the law of that Member State.
The receiving agency informs the addressee in writing using the standard form that he may refuse to accept the document at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within 1 week if it is not either in a language which he understands or in the official language or one of the official languages of the place of service. This rule also applies to service by diplomatic or consular agents, service by postal services and direct service. It is established that the service of the refused document can be remedied through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.

EU procedure for assessing and authorising food additives, enzymes and flavourings
EU procedure for assessing and authorising food additives, enzymes and flavourings
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes a common procedure for the assessment and authorisation of food additives, enzymes and flavourings in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
This regulation sets out the stages of the procedure for updating the list of authorised substances and the role of the parties involved.
The European Commission (the EU’s executive body) sets up the procedure and, where necessary, seeks the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
The EFSA provides an independent scientific assessment of the risks that the substances pose to human health.
The Commission then takes a risk management decision based on the opinion of the EFSA and other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration.
The Commission publishes a list of authorised substances.
The procedure can be started either by the Commission or following an application by an interested party.
The Commission informs the Member States and, where applicable, requests the opinion of the EFSA.
The EFSA delivers its opinion within 9 months of receipt of a valid application.

Summary 175:
control scheme for fishing vessels in the Convention Area
SUMMARY
The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a scheme of control and enforcement applicable to fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area which lies beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties (the Regulatory Area). The scheme provides for control and enforcement measures applicable to vessels flying the flag of Contracting Parties and operating in the Regulatory Area, and arrangements for inspection at sea which include inspection and surveillance procedures and infringement procedures which must be implemented by the Contracting Parties.
The scheme also comprises provisions to promote compliance by vessels flying the flag of a non-Contracting Party with the control and enforcement measures in order to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC. The Regulation incorporates the NEAFC scheme into Union law.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The Regulation applies to:
the landing or transhipment of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party;
fishing vessels flying the flag of a non-Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area;
EU fishing vessels and fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area.
Monitoring measures
The Commission must be informed by the end of each year of the vessels authorised to fish in the Regulatory Area, as well as any subsequent amendments. It must forward this information to the NEAFC Secretary.
Vessels flying the flag of a Member State must carry on board:
a valid fishing licence;
a fishing logbook or an electronic logbook;
a valid catch certificate.
EU vessels may only engage in transhipment operations or joint fishing operations with vessels flying the flag of a Contracting Party and vessels of a non-Contracting Party granted the status of a cooperating non-Contracting Party by NEAFC.
Inspections at sea
NEAFC inspectors may board a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Contracting Party at any time, day or night, and without prior notice being given to the vessel. The vessel must provide the inspectors with any assistance which is required. The duration of an inspection must not exceed 4 hours, or the time it takes to haul in the net and to inspect the net and the catch, whichever is longer.
The Commission or the body designated by it must send to the NEAFC Secretary before 1 January each year details of the plan, including the names of the NEAFC inspectors and special inspection vessels as well as the types of aircraft and their identification details (registration number, name, radio call-sign) which Member States are assigning to the Scheme during that year.
Port state control of fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party
Member States must designate and notify the Commission of ports where the landing or transhipment of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party are permitted.
When the master of a fishing vessel carrying fish intends to call into a port to land or tranship fish, he must notify the competent authorities of the Member State of the port he wishes to use no later than three working days before the estimated time of arrival.
Landing or transhipment operations may only start after authorisation has been given by the competent authorities of the port Member State. Such authorisation shall only be given if the confirmation from the flag state has been received.
Each Member State must carry out inspections of at least 15 % of landings or transhipments in its ports during each reporting year.
Infringements
The Regulation applies to EU fishing vessels and to fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area.
The Commission or the body designated by it must forward the information to the NEAFC Secretary.
Reporting and follow-up of infringements
The Commission or the body designated by it must compile a Union report on the basis of the reports of the Member States.
Reporting of non-Contracting Parties’ activities
The Commission or the body designated by it must send a global report on non-Contracting Parties’ activities to the NEAFC Secretary by 1 March each year.
Confidentiality
The Commission or the body designated by it may grant access to the inspectors to the databases, registers and other information held by the Commission or the body designated by it, or by the Member States, which are relevant for the purpose of carrying out the inspection and surveillance procedures, provided that such access is granted on a case-by-case basis and that the confidentiality of the information is preserved.
The Commission or the body designated by it may grant access to the inspectors to the databases, registers and other information held by the Commission or the body designated by it, or by the Member States, which are relevant for the purpose of carrying out the inspection and surveillance procedures, provided that such access is granted on a case-by-case basis and that the confidentiality of the information is preserved.

Summary 176:
Ecolabel for environmentally friendly products
The EU Ecolabel is a voluntary scheme that aims to encourage the marketing of products and services that are environmentally friendly throughout their life cycle. It is awarded to products and services that have a high level of environmental performance, verified by an independent body.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
It establishes a framework for the EU Ecolabel scheme, which is intended to promote products and services that have a high level of environmental performance.
It sets out the conditions under which the EU Ecolabel may be used, in particular the conditions for the award of the label and the market surveillance and control of its use.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The EU Ecolabel scheme covers products and services that are supplied for distribution, consumption or use in the EU, whether in return for payment or free of charge.
It does not apply to medicinal products for human use or for veterinary use, or to any type of medical device.
Criteria
EU Ecolabel criteria are based on the environmental performance of products, taking into account the latest strategic objectives of the EU in the field of the environment.
In determining such criteria, the following are considered:
the most significant environmental impacts, in particular the impact on climate change, the impact on nature and biodiversity, energy and resource consumption, generation of waste, emissions to all environmental media, pollution through physical effects and use and release of hazardous substances;
the substitution of hazardous substances by safer substances, as such or via the use of other substances.
EU Ecolabel criteria include requirements intended to ensure that the products bearing the EU Ecolabel function adequately in accordance with their intended use.
The Commission decides, taking into account the outcome of a study and the opinion of the European Union Ecolabelling Board (EUEB), for which group of food and feed, if any, the development of EU Ecolabel criteria is feasible.
Development and revision of EU Ecolabel criteria
The EUEB may initiate and lead the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria. In this regard, consortiums consisting of more than one interest group are favoured.
The party which initiates and leads the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria produces the following documents:
a preliminary report;
a proposal for draft criteria;
a technical report in support of the proposal for draft criteria;
a final report;
a manual for potential users of the EU Ecolabel and competent bodies;
a manual for authorities awarding public contracts.
The Commission decides, taking into account the outcome of the study and the opinion of the EUEB, for which group of food and feed, if any, the development of EU Ecolabel criteria is feasible.
Award of the EU Ecolabel and terms and conditions of its use
The EU Ecolabel may be awarded by a competent body to a product or service only if it complies with the relevant EU Ecolabel criteria and the assessment requirements.
To be awarded the EU Ecolabel, the product or service must first be registered. The competent body may reject the application if the operator fails to complete the documentation within 6 months after such notification.
If the product complies with the EU Ecolabel criteria and the assessment requirements, the competent body shall assign a registration number to the product. The operator may place the EU Ecolabel on the product only after conclusion of the contract.
The EU Ecolabel may be used on the products for which the EU Ecolabel has been awarded and on their associated promotional material.
The right to use the EU Ecolabel does not extend to the use of the EU Ecolabel as a component of a trademark.
Market surveillance and control of the use of the EU Ecolabel
The competent body shall, as appropriate, undertake on-site verifications or assign an authorised agent for that purpose.
The user of the EU Ecolabel shall allow the competent body which has awarded the EU Ecolabel to the product to undertake all necessary investigations to monitor its on-going compliance with the product group criteria and Article 9.
Where, after giving the user of the EU Ecolabel the opportunity to submit observations, any competent body finds that a product bearing the EU Ecolabel does not comply with the relevant product group criteria or that the EU Ecolabel is not used in accordance with Article 9, it shall either prohibit the use of the EU Ecolabel on that product, or, in the event that the EU Ecolabel has been awarded by another competent body, it shall inform that competent body.
The competent body shall without delay inform all other competent bodies and the Commission of that prohibition.
Ecolabelling schemes in the Member States
In order to harmonise the criteria of European ecolabelling schemes (EN ISO 14024 type I), EU Ecolabel criteria shall also take into account existing criteria developed in officially recognised ecolabelling schemes in the Member States.
Promotion of the EU Ecolabel
The Commission shall promote the EU Ecolabel via the EU Ecolabel website providing basic information and promotional materials on the EU Ecolabel, and information on where to purchase EU Ecolabel products, in all EU languages.
Exchange of information and experiences
In order to foster consistent implementation of this Regulation, competent bodies shall regularly exchange information and experiences, in particular on the application of Articles 9 and 10.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 3 July 2013.
BACKGROUND
The EU Ecolabel scheme was first established in 1992. In 2009, the Commission launched a public consultation on the EU Ecolabel scheme and on the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.
In 2011, the Commission adopted a communication on a Roadmap for Sustainable Chemicals and a legislative proposal on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) amendment regulation.
The aim of the amendment was to address the lack of information on the risks of certain substances, to improve the functioning of the authorisation and restriction processes, and to ensure a better functioning of the process of authorisation and restriction of certain substances. It was also intended to improve the functioning of the process of registration of substances and the evaluation of their effects on human health and the environment.
