 Regulation (EU) 2019/26 — type-approval of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
Regulation (EU) 2019/26 complements Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 by establishing special provisions for the EU type-approval and the placing on the market of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which have been type-approved by the type-approval authority of the United Kingdom (‘UK type-approval authority’) while the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) of this Regulation still applies to and in the United Kingdom.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units type-approved by the United Kingdom, in accordance with Union legislation, can continue to be placed on the Union market after the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which fall within the scope of Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and their types which have been approved by the UK type-approval authority on the basis of those acts or any regulatory act of the Union listed in Annex IV to Directive 2007/46/EC or any regulatory act repealed by those regulatory acts of the Union.
The regulation defines the following:
‘Union type-approval authority’ means a type-approval authority of a Member State other than the United Kingdom;
‘UK type-approval’ means an EC type-approval or EU type-approval granted by the UK type-approval authority;
‘Union type-approval’ means an EU type-approval granted by a Union type-approval authority in accordance with this Regulation.
Manufacturers holding a UK type-approval that has not become invalid pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2007/46/EC, Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 may, until the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) of this Regulation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom, submit an application to a Union type-approval authority for a Union type-approval of the same type.
In order to be approved, the type must comply with the requirements for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units applicable at the time when the Union type-approval takes effect.
The Union type-approval authority which has received an application in accordance with Article 4 of this Regulation may grant a Union type-approval with respect to a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit if the type in question meets, at the time when the Union type-approval takes effect, the requirements applicable for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.
The Union type-approval shall take effect on the day of its granting or on a later date determined therein. The UK type-approval shall become invalid on the day preceding the day on which the Union type-approval takes effect. In any event, it shall become invalid at the latest on the day on which the Union type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.
A Union type-approval shall be considered to be an EC type-approval or an EU type-approval within the meaning of Directive 2007/46/EC or any act listed in Annex IV to that Directive, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. All provisions of those acts not derogated from in this Regulation shall continue to apply. The Union type-approval authority shall take full responsibility for the obligations stemming from the Union type-approval.
The type approved in accordance with this Article shall receive an EU type-approval certificate with a number consisting of the distinguishing number of the Member State whose type-approval authority granted the Union type-approval and of the number of the applicable act referred to in Article 2(1). It shall also include the number of the latest amending act containing requirements for type-approval in accordance with which the Union type-approval is granted.
When applying for a Union type-approval under Article 4, a manufacturer shall also request the Union type-approval authority in question to take over the obligations of the UK type-approval authority with respect to the manufacturer's other vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union on the basis of UK type-approvals that have either become invalid pursuant to Article 17 of Directive 2007/46/EC, Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, or for which no Union type-approval is sought under this Regulation.

Summary 36:
 European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE)
The European Commission has proposed the establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak. This instrument aims at addressing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and respond to its socio-economic consequences.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the ‘Instrument’).
The Instrument aims at complementing national measures taken by affected Member States by providing financial assistance to help those Member States cope with the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure intended to mitigate the direct economic, social and health-related effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
KEY POINTS
The Instrument provides financial assistance to a Member State which is experiencing, or is seriously threatened with, a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak for the financing, primarily, of short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the self-employed and thus reducing the incidence of unemployment and loss of income, as well as for the financing, as an ancillary, of some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace.
The maximum amount of financial assistance under the Instrument is EUR 100 billion for all Member States.
A Member State may request Union financial assistance under the Instrument (‘financial assistance’) where its actual and possibly also planned public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased as of 1 February 2020 due to national measures directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures to address the socio-economic effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The financial assistance takes the form of a loan granted by the Union to the Member State concerned.
The Commission shall consult the Member State concerned without undue delay to verify the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures, as well as, where appropriate, to relevant health-related measures, in the Member State requesting financial assistance which are linked to the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Commission shall be empowered to borrow on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the Union at the most appropriate time so as to optimise the cost of funding and preserve its reputation as the Union’s issuer in the markets.
The Commission shall establish the necessary arrangements for the administration of the loans with the European Central Bank.
The Commission shall conclude an agreement with a contributing Member State on the irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand guarantees provided by Member States.
The loan granted under the Instrument shall be disbursed in instalments.
The Instrument shall only become available after all Member States have contributed to the Instrument in accordance with Article 11 for an amount representing at least 25 % of the maximum amount referred to in Article 5, provided that the relative shares of contributions of each Member State of the overall amount of Member States’ contributions correspond to the relative shares of Member States in the total gross national income of the Union.
The Commission shall inform the Council when the Instrument becomes available.
The period of availability of the Instrument during which a decision referred to in Article 6(1) may be adopted shall end on 31 December 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties
Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It sets up a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
              
CCPs are essential to the smooth functioning of the EU financial markets. They are responsible for clearing and settling the trades of their members. They also manage the risks of their members’ trades and ensure that the financial obligations of their members are fulfilled.
In the event of CCP failure, the regulation sets up a framework for the recovery and resolution of CCPs.
The regulation applies to CCPs that are authorised in the EU.
The regulation complements Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which provides for uniform prudential requirements applicable to CCPs.
Competent authorities and resolution authorities
Competent authorities and resolution authorities are designated by the Member States. The authorities must work together in supervisory and resolution colleges to ensure that they can cooperate and coordinate effectively.
The regulation lays down common conditions for the exercise of recovery and resolution powers by the authorities. It also establishes common objectives for the resolution of CCPs.
Recovery
Competent authorities must ensure that CCPs develop and maintain recovery plans that enable them to restore their viability in the event of financial distress. The authorities must also ensure that CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The recovery plan must cover a broad range of scenarios, including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both. The plan must also include comprehensive arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The plan must be reviewed and updated at least once a year.
The authorities must assess the plan to ensure that it is comprehensive and that it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner.
The plan must be non-discriminatory and balanced in terms of its impact and the incentives it creates. The effects of the recovery measures on clearing members and, where applicable, their clients and on the financial system of the EU or of one or more of its Member States more broadly must be proportionate.
The plan must be submitted to the competent authorities, which must then assess whether the plan is comprehensive and whether it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner. The authorities must ensure that the CCP implements the plan.
Resolution
The authorities must ensure that CCPs develop and maintain resolution plans that enable them to maintain the continuity of critical functions and to protect the financial stability of the EU and of its Member States.
The authorities must ensure that the CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
The resolution plan must cover a broad range of scenarios, including scenarios resulting from default events, non-default events and a combination of both.
The plan must be reviewed and updated at least once a year.
The authorities must assess the plan to ensure that it is comprehensive and that it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner.
The plan must be non-discriminatory and balanced in terms of its impact and the incentives it creates. The effects of the resolution measures on clearing members and, where applicable, their clients and on the financial system of the EU or of one or more of its Member States more broadly must be proportionate.
The plan must be submitted to the competent authorities, which must then assess whether the plan is comprehensive and whether it could feasibly restore the viability of the CCP in a timely manner. The authorities must ensure that the CCP implements the plan.
The authorities must ensure that the CCPs have in place appropriate arrangements for the re-establishment of a matched book and for the full allocation of losses arising from clearing member default.
Early intervention
Competent authorities must be able to take early intervention measures to remedy the deterioration of a CCP’s financial and economic situation before it reaches a point at which authorities have no other alternative but to resolve it or to direct the CCP to change its recovery measures where they could be detrimental for overall financial stability.
Early intervention measures include the power to restrict or prohibit any remuneration of equity and instruments treated as equity, including dividend payments and buybacks by the CCP, to the fullest extent possible without triggering an event of default, and also the power to restrict, prohibit or freeze any payments of variable remuneration as defined by the CCP’s remuneration policy pursuant to Article 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, discretionary pension benefits or severance packages to senior management.
Conditions for resolution
A CCP may be considered to be failing or likely to fail when it infringes or is likely in the near future to infringe the requirements for continuing authorisation, when its recovery has failed or is likely to fail to restore its viability, when the CCP is unable or is likely to be unable to provide a critical function, when the assets of the CCP are or are likely in the near future to be less than its liabilities, when the CCP is or is likely in the near future to be unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due, or when the CCP requires extraordinary public financial support.
The fact that a CCP does not comply with all the requirements for authorisation should not justify by itself the entry into resolution.
Emergency liquidity assistance from a central bank, where such a facility is available, should not be a condition that demonstrates that a CCP is or will be, in the near future, unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. In order to preserve financial stability, in particular in the case of a systemic liquidity shortage, State guarantees on liquidity facilities provided by central banks or State guarantees of newly issued liabilities to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State should not trigger entry into resolution, provided that a number of conditions are met.
Resolution powers
The resolution authority has a broad range of powers at its disposal to ensure the continuity of critical functions of a CCP that is failing or likely to fail.
The powers include the ability to:
restructure the assets and liabilities of the CCP;
sell, transfer or liquidate the assets of the CCP;
appoint a manager to manage the CCP’s affairs;
designate an entity to carry out the critical functions of the CCP;
transfer the rights and obligations of the CCP to another entity;
restructure or terminate the CCP’s contracts;
convert the CCP’s equity into debt;
write-down, write-up or exchange the CCP’s equity;
cancel or modify the CCP’s contracts;
exercise rights and powers over the CCP’s property;

stimulate discussion on how to modernise rolling stock and on how to further develop and increase the capacity of railway infrastructure in order to facilitate the broader use of passenger and freight transport by rail, underlining in that context the importance of the cooperation among infrastructure managers, research and innovation and the role of the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking;
stimulate discussion on how to modernise rolling stock and on how to further develop and increase the capacity of railway infrastructure in order to facilitate the broader use of passenger and freight transport by rail, underlining in that context the importance of the cooperation among infrastructure managers, research and innovation and the role of the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking;
promote events and initiatives to disseminate information on the rights of rail passengers and to stimulate cooperation among all actors in order to improve customer information and ticketing, including the offer of through-tickets and developing innovative digital multi-modal tickets, as well as to provide information about current challenges in that respect, such as the need for data sharing among actors.
The measures to be taken to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2 shall be closely coordinated with on-going activities promoting rail transport. Those measures shall include the following activities at EU, national, regional or local level, organised in partnerships or individually, and linked to the objectives of the European Year:
initiatives and events to promote debate, build a positive image, raise awareness and facilitate the engagement of citizens, businesses and public authorities in order to increase trust in rail, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, and to promote the attractiveness of rail for the transport of more people and goods as a means of combating climate change, through multiple channels and tools, including events in EU countries, while also highlighting the safety and comfort of travelling by rail;
initiatives in EU countries to encourage, in both the public and private sector, business-travel and commuting patterns by rail;
informative exhibitions, inspirational, educational and awareness-raising campaigns, as well as the use of demonstration and information trains to encourage changes in passenger, consumer and business behaviour and to stimulate the general public to actively contribute to achieving the objectives of more sustainable transport;
sharing the experience and best practices of national, regional and local authorities, civil society, businesses and schools as regards promoting the use of rail and on how to implement behavioural change at all levels;
undertaking studies and innovative activities, and disseminating their results on a European or national scale;
promoting projects and networks related to the European Year, including via the media, social networks and other online communities;
partnerships and events such as those set out in the Annex;
identifying and promoting best practices to create a level-playing field for different modes of transport;
promoting projects and activities to raise awareness of sustainable end-to-end mobility that delivers seamless ‘door-to-door’ travel solutions in combination with other modes of transport, including active travel, and sustainable and smart logistics;
promoting projects and activities fostering awareness of the importance of the single European railway area, in particular as regards its on-going implementation, actions facilitating international railway journeys and actions for digital passenger information, such as those providing real-time information about journey offers, fares and timetables, including from independent providers, facilitating comparison; and
promoting projects and activities with a view to the realisation of an extended, modernised and interoperable railway infrastructure, including a European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), terminals offering modal shift options, as well as modernised rolling stock.
The Commission shall consider initiating, during the European Year:
a study on the feasibility of creating a European label to promote goods and products transported by rail so as to encourage businesses to switch their transport to rail; and
a feasibility study with a view to introducing a rail connectivity index, with the aim of categorising the level of integration achieved through the use of services on the rail network and showing the potential of rail to compete with other modes of transport.
The EU institutions and bodies, as well as EU countries, at EU and national level respectively, may refer to the European Year and make use of its visual identity in promoting the activities referred to in paragraph 1.
The organisation of participation in the European Year at national level is a responsibility of EU countries. They shall ensure the coordination of relevant activities at national level and shall appoint national contact persons to ensure coordination at EU level.

Summary 40:
 minimum requirements for water reuse
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to guarantee that reclaimed water is safe for agricultural irrigation, thereby ensuring a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health, promoting the circular economy, supporting adaptation to climate change, and contributing to the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC by addressing water scarcity and the resulting pressure on water resources, in a coordinated way throughout the EU, thus also contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies whenever treated urban waste water is reused, in accordance with Article 12(1) of Directive 91/271/EEC, for agricultural irrigation as specified in Annex I to the regulation.
A Member State may decide that it is not appropriate to reuse water for agricultural irrigation in one or more of its river basin districts or parts thereof, taking into account the following criteria:
the geographic and climatic conditions of the district or parts thereof;
the pressures on and the status of other water resources, including the quantitative status of groundwater bodies as referred to in Directive 2000/60/EC;
the pressures on and the status of the surface water bodies in which treated urban waste water is discharged;
the environmental and resource costs of reclaimed water and of other water resources.
Any decision taken pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be duly justified on the basis of the criteria referred to in that subparagraph and submitted to the Commission. It shall be reviewed as necessary, in particular taking into account climate change projections and national climate change adaptation strategies, and at least every 6 years taking into account river basin management plans established pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC.
The regulation applies without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 and does not preclude food business operators from obtaining the water quality required to comply with that regulation by using, at a subsequent stage, several water treatment options alone or in combination with non-treatment options, or from using alternative water sources for agricultural irrigation.
Competent authorities
A competent authority is an authority or a body designated by a Member State to carry out its obligations under the regulation regarding the granting of permits for the production or supply of reclaimed water, regarding exemptions for research or pilot projects and regarding compliance checks.
Reclaimed water
Reclaimed water means urban waste water that has been treated in compliance with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC and which results from further treatment in a reclamation facility in accordance with Annex I to the regulation.
Reclamation facility
A reclamation facility is an urban waste water treatment plant or other facility that further treats urban waste water that complies with the requirements set out in Directive 91/271/EEC in order to produce water that is fit for a use specified in Annex I to the regulation.
Risk management
For the purpose of producing, supplying and using reclaimed water, the competent authority ensures that a water reuse risk management plan is established.
One water reuse risk management plan may cover one or more water reuse systems.
The water reuse risk management plan is prepared by the reclamation facility operator, other responsible parties and end-users, as appropriate.
The responsible party must ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is implemented.
Monitoring
The reclamation facility operator shall monitor water quality in accordance with the following:
Section 2 of Annex I;
any additional conditions set by the competent authority in the relevant permit pursuant to points (c) and (d) of Article 6(3), as regards monitoring.
Permits
A permit is a written authorisation issued by a competent authority to produce or supply reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation in accordance with the regulation.
The reclamation facility operator shall ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is implemented and that the reclaimed water complies with the conditions of the permit.
The reclamation facility operator shall notify the competent authority of any significant changes in the water reuse system, in particular, when the water reuse risk management plan is revised.
The competent authority shall verify the compliance of the reclaimed water with the conditions of the permit. If non-compliance is found, the competent authority shall require the responsible parties to take the necessary measures to ensure that the reclaimed water is in compliance. The supply of the reclaimed water shall be suspended where non-compliance causes a significant risk to the environment or to human or animal health.
The reclamation facility operator shall supply the reclaimed water in accordance with the conditions set out in the permit.
The competent authority shall ensure that the water reuse risk management plan is reviewed at least once every 5 years.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 14 July 2021.

 Regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to lay down uniform technical and business requirements for card-based payment transactions carried out within the European Union (EU), where both the payer’s payment service provider and the payee’s payment service provider are located therein.
The regulation does not apply to services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet one of the following conditions:
instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer or within a limited network of service providers under direct commercial agreement with a professional issuer;
instruments which can be used only to acquire a very limited range of goods or services;
instruments valid only in a single EU country provided at the request of an undertaking or a public sector entity and regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services from suppliers having a commercial agreement with the issuer.
It does not apply to:
transactions with commercial cards;
cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines or at the counter of a payment service provider; and
transactions with payment cards issued by 3-party payment card schemes.
KEY POINTS
Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
The regulation prohibits interchange fees for card-based payment transactions between the payer’s payment service provider and the payee’s payment service provider.
However, the prohibition does not apply to transactions with commercial cards.
It does not apply to cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines or at the counter of a payment service provider and transactions with payment cards issued by 3-party payment card schemes.
Interchange fees for debit card transactions
The regulation does not prohibit interchange fees for domestic debit card transactions.
It does not apply to 3-party payment card schemes until 9 December 2018 in relation to domestic payment transactions, provided that the card-based payment transactions made in a Member State under such a 3-party payment card scheme do not exceed on a yearly basis 3 % of the value of all card-based payment transactions made in that Member State.
Interchange fees for credit card transactions
The regulation does not prohibit interchange fees for credit card transactions.
It does not apply to 3-party payment card schemes until 9 December 2018 in relation to domestic payment transactions, provided that the card-based payment transactions made in a Member State under such a 3-party payment card scheme do not exceed on a yearly basis 3 % of the value of all card-based payment transactions made in that Member State.
Separation of scheme and infrastructure
Payment card schemes and payment service providers must be independent in terms of accounting, organisation and decision-making process. They must not discriminate, for instance by providing each other with preferential treatment or privileged information which is not available to their competitors on their respective market segment, imposing excessive information requirements on their competitor in their respective market segment, cross-subsidising their respective activities or having shared governance arrangements.
‘Honour all cards’ rule
The ‘honour all cards’ rule is a twofold obligation imposed by issuers and payment card schemes for payees to accept all the cards of the same brand, irrespective of the different costs of these cards (the ‘honour all products’ element) and irrespective of the individual issuing bank which has issued the card (the ‘honour all issuers’ element).
It is in the interest of the consumer that for the same category of cards the payees cannot discriminate between issuers or cardholders, and payment card schemes and payment service providers can impose such an obligation on them. Therefore the ‘honour all issuers’ element of the ‘honour all cards’ rule is a justifiable rule within a payment card scheme, since it prevents payees from discriminating between individual banks which have issued a card.
The ‘honour all products’ element is essentially a tying practice that has the effect of tying acceptance of low fee cards to the acceptance of high fee cards. A removal of the ‘honour all products’ element of the ‘honour all cards’ rule would allow merchants to limit the choice of payment cards they offer to low(er) cost payment cards only, which would also benefit consumers through reduced merchants’ costs.
Merchants accepting debit cards would then not be forced to accept credit cards, and those accepting credit cards would not be forced to accept commercial cards.
However, to protect the consumer and the consumer’s ability to use the payment cards as often as possible, merchants must be obliged to accept cards that are subject to the same regulated interchange fee only if issued within the same brand and of the same category (prepaid card, debit card or credit card).
Clear distinction between consumer and commercial cards
Payees and payers must have the means to identify the different categories of cards. Therefore, the various brands and categories must be identifiable electronically and for newly issued card-based payment instruments visibly on the device.
In addition, the payer must be informed about the acceptance of the payer’s payment instrument(s) at a given point of sale.
The payer must also have the possibility to choose the payment application, and the payer’s payment instrument must not be blocked for the payer.
Steering of the payer by the payee
The payer must be free to steer the payer towards the use of a specific payment instrument.
Payment card schemes and payment service providers must not impose several restrictions on payees in this respect, examples of which include restrictions on the refusal by the payee of specific payment instruments for low amounts, on the provision of information to the payer on the fees incurred by the payee for specific payment instruments or limitation imposed on the payee of the number of tills in his or her shop which accept specific payment instruments.
Redress procedures
Member States must establish adequate and effective out-of-court complaint and redress procedures or take equivalent measures.

international inland waterways transport: inland waterways transport between two ports located in different national territories;
transit inland waterways transport: inland waterways transport through a national territory between two ports both located in another national territory or national territories provided that in the total journey within the national territory there is no transshipment;
inland waterways traffic: any movement of a vessel on a given navigable inland waterway.
Data collection
EU countries shall transmit data relating to inland waterways transport on their national territory to the European Commission (Eurostat).
EU countries in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 million tonnes shall supply the data required under Article 4(1) of this regulation.
By way of derogation from the previous paragraph, EU countries which do not have international or transit inland waterways transport but in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1 million tonnes shall supply only the data required under Article 4(2).
Data shall be collected in accordance with the tables set out in Annexes I to V of this regulation.
Goods shall be classified in accordance with Annex VI.

members of the armed forces travelling on NATO or Partnership for Peace business and holders of identification and movement orders provided for by the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces of 19 June 1951;
without prejudice to the requirements stemming from the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees of the Council of Europe signed at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959, recognised refugees and stateless persons and other persons who do not hold the nationality of any country who reside in the United Kingdom or in Ireland and are holders of a travel document issued by the United Kingdom or Ireland, which is recognised by the Member State concerned.
A Member State may provide for exceptions from the visa requirement provided for in Article 3 or from the exemption from the visa requirement provided for in Article 4 as regards:
holders of diplomatic passports, service/official passports or special passports;
civilian air and sea crew members in the performance of their duties;
civilian sea crew members, when they go ashore, who hold a seafarer’s identity document issued in accordance with the International Labour Organisation Conventions No 108 of 13 May 1958 or No 185 of 19 June 2003 or the International Maritime Organization Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic of 9 April 1965;
crew and members of emergency or rescue missions in the event of a disaster or an accident;

Summary 51:
 EU law on combating money laundering by criminal law
SUMMARY
EU law on combating money laundering by criminal law
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to combat money laundering by means of criminal law, enabling more efficient and swifter cross-border cooperation between competent authorities.
KEY POINTS
The definition of criminal activities which constitute predicate offences for money laundering is sufficiently uniform in all EU countries. EU countries ensure that all offences that are punishable by a term of imprisonment as set out in this Directive are considered predicate offences for money laundering.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the following conduct, when committed intentionally, is punishable as a criminal offence:
the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such an activity to evade the legal consequences of that person’s action;
the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of, property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity;
the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing at the time of receipt, that such property was derived from criminal activity.
EU countries may take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in the previous paragraph is punishable as a criminal offence where the offender suspected or ought to have known that the property was derived from criminal activity.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that:
a prior or simultaneous conviction for the criminal activity from which the property was derived is not a prerequisite for a conviction for the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs;
a conviction for the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs is possible where it is established that the property was derived from a criminal activity, without it being necessary to establish all the factual elements or all circumstances relating to that criminal activity, including the identity of the perpetrator;
the offences referred to in the first and second paragraphs extend to property derived from conduct that occurred on the territory of another EU country or of a third country, where that conduct would constitute a criminal activity had it occurred domestically.
EU countries may further require that the relevant conduct constitutes a criminal offence under the national law of the other EU country or of the third country where that conduct was committed, except where that conduct constitutes one of the offences referred to in points (a) to (e) and (h) of point (1) of Article 2 and as defined in the applicable EU law.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the conduct referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 is punishable as a criminal offence when committed by persons who committed, or were involved in, the criminal activity from which the property was derived.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 4 years.
EU countries may provide that, in relation to the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4, the following circumstances are to be regarded as aggravating circumstances:
the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation within the meaning of Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA; or
the offender is an obliged entity within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and has committed the offence in the exercise of their professional activities.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for any of the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 committed for their benefit by any person, acting either individually or as part of an organ of the legal person and having a leading position within the legal person, based on any of the following:
a power of representation of the legal person;
an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or
an authority to exercise control within the legal person.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in the previous paragraph has made possible the commission of any of the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person held liable pursuant to Article 7 is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, which shall include criminal or non-criminal fines and may include other sanctions, such as:
exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid;
temporary or permanent exclusion from access to public funding, including tender procedures, grants and concessions;
temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice of commercial activities;
placing under judicial supervision;
a judicial winding-up order;
temporary or permanent closure of establishments which have been used for committing the offence.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure, as appropriate, that their competent authorities freeze or confiscate, in accordance with Directive 2014/42/EU, the proceeds derived from and instrumentalities used or intended to be used in the commission or contribution to the commission of the offences as referred to in this Directive.
Each EU country takes the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 where:
the offence is committed in whole or in part on its territory;
the offender is one of its nationals.
EU countries take the necessary measures to ensure that effective investigative tools, such as those used in combating organised crime or other serious crimes are available to the persons, units or services responsible for investigating or prosecuting the offences referred to in Article 3(1) and (5) and Article 4.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
The Directive applies from 3 December 2020.

Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
The EU is implementing a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (EAM) that was recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
KEY POINTS
              
The objective of this Regulation is to ensure that the biomass of bluefin tuna in the EAM is at least 60% of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2022, with at least a 60% probability of achieving this objective.
This Regulation lays down the general rules for the application by the Union of the recovery plan, as defined in Article 3.
This Regulation applies to bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the EAM.
The recovery plan applies from 2007 to 2022.
The EU shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of its catching vessels and its traps are commensurate with the bluefin tuna fishing opportunities available to it in the EAM.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 31 January each year:
an annual fishing plan for the catching vessels and traps fishing bluefin tuna in the EAM;
an annual fishing capacity management plan ensuring that the Member State's fishing capacity is commensurate with its allocated quota.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 15 April each year an annual farming management plan if it intends to modify the ICCAT plan for farming capacity in force.
By 31 January each year, each Member State with a bluefin tuna quota shall transmit to the Commission:
an annual fishing plan for the catching vessels and traps fishing bluefin tuna in the EAM;
an annual fishing capacity management plan ensuring that the Member State's fishing capacity is commensurate with its allocated quota.
The Commission shall compile the plans transmitted by the Member States and integrate them into the Union fishing and capacity management plan. The Commission shall transmit that plan to the ICCAT Secretariat by 15 February of each year for discussion and approval by ICCAT.
Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission by 31 January each year an annual farming management plan if it intends to modify the ICCAT plan for farming capacity in force.
Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of its catching vessels and its traps are commensurate with the bluefin tuna fishing opportunities available to it in the EAM.
The maximum number of traps registered in a Member State and of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State that may fish for, retain on board, tranship, transport, or land bluefin tuna, shall be determined in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The maximum number and the corresponding gross tonnage of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State engaged in bluefin tuna fishery shall be limited to the number, and the total corresponding gross tonnage, of fishing vessels flying the flag of that Member State that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed bluefin tuna from 1 January 2007 to 1 July 2008. That limit shall apply by gear type for catching vessels.
The maximum number of traps of a Member State engaged in bluefin tuna fishery shall be limited to the number of traps authorised by that Member State by 1 July 2008.
The maximum bluefin tuna farming and fattening capacity for each Member State and the maximum input of wild-caught bluefin tuna that each Member State may allocate shall be determined in accordance with the TFEU and Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The maximum bluefin tuna farming and fattening capacity of a Member State shall be limited to the bluefin tuna farming and fattening capacity of the farms of that Member State that were registered in the ICCAT record of farming facilities or authorised and declared to ICCAT on 1 July 2008.
The maximum input of wild-caught bluefin tuna into the farms of a Member State shall be limited to the level of the input quantities registered with ICCAT by the farms of that Member State in the years 2005, 2006, 2007 or 2008.
By way of derogation from Article 12(1), a minimum conservation reference size for bluefin tuna of 8 kg or 75 cm fork length shall apply to the following fisheries:
bluefin tuna caught in the eastern Atlantic by baitboats and trolling boats;
bluefin tuna caught in the Adriatic Sea for farming purposes;
bluefin tuna caught in the Mediterranean Sea by the coastal and artisanal fishery for fresh fish by baitboats, longliners and handliners.
Each Member State concerned shall issue specific authorisations to vessels fishing under the derogation referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 14(2). The vessels concerned shall be indicated in the list of catching vessels referred to in point (a) of Article 20(1). For that purpose, the provisions laid down in Articles 20 and 21 shall apply.
Without prejudice to Article 14(1), incidental catches of a maximum 5 % of bluefin tuna weighing between 8 and 30 kg or with a fork length between 75 and 115 cm shall be allowed for all catching vessels and traps fishing actively for bluefin tuna.
The percentage of 5 % referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 15 shall be calculated on the basis of the total catches of bluefin tuna in number of fish retained on board the vessel or inside the trap at any time after each fishing operation.
Incidental catches of bluefin tuna shall be deducted from the quota of the Member State responsible for the catching vessel or trap.
Incidental catches of bluefin tuna shall be subject to Articles 25, 30, 31 and 32.
Each Member State shall make provision for by-catch of bluefin tuna within its quota and shall inform the Commission thereof when transmitting its fishing plan. Such provision shall ensure that all dead fish are deducted from the quota.
Each Member State shall submit electronically each year to the Commission one month before the start of the fishing seasons referred to in Articles 11 and 12, where applicable, and otherwise one month before the start of the period of authorisation:
a list of all catching vessels flying its flag authorised to fish actively for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean by the issuing of a fishing authorisation;
a list of all other fishing vessels, other than catching vessels, flying its flag authorised to operate for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
Both lists shall be set up in accordance with the format set in the Guidelines by ICCAT for submitting the data and information required.
During a calendar year, a fishing vessel may be included in both of the lists referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 20(1) provided that it is not included in both lists at the same time.
The lists referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 20(1) shall contain the vessel's name and Union fleet register number (CFR) as defined in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004.
No retroactive submission shall be accepted.

Supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas
Supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas
The EU introduces supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It seeks to prevent the financing of armed groups and security forces in resource-rich areas through trade in tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.
KEY POINTS
The regulation establishes a Union system for supply chain due diligence (‘Union system’) in order to curtail opportunities for armed groups and security forces to trade in tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold.
The regulation lays down the supply chain due diligence obligations of Union importers of minerals or metals containing or consisting of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold, as set out in Annex I.
The regulation shall not apply to Union importers of minerals or metals where their annual import volume of each of the minerals or metals concerned is below the volume thresholds set out in Annex I. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend Annex I by establishing and amending the volume thresholds of minerals and metals.
The regulation does not apply to recycled metals.
The regulation shall not apply to stocks where a Union importer demonstrates that those stocks were created in the current form on a verifiable date prior to 1 February 2013.
The regulation applies to minerals and metals referred to in Annex I that are obtained as by-products as defined in the regulation.
The regulation applies to minerals and metals referred to in Annex I that are obtained as by-products as defined in the regulation.
The regulation defines ‘conflict-affected and high-risk areas’ as areas in a state of armed conflict or fragile post-conflict as well as areas witnessing weak or non-existent governance and security, such as failed states, and widespread and systematic violations of international law, including human rights abuses.
The regulation defines ‘smelters and refiners’ as any natural or legal person performing forms of extractive metallurgy involving processing steps with the aim to produce a metal from a mineral.
The regulation defines ‘Union importer’ as any natural or legal person declaring minerals or metals for release for free circulation within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 or any natural or legal person on whose behalf such declaration is made, as indicated in data elements 3/15 and 3/16 in accordance with Annex B to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.
The regulation defines ‘supply chain due diligence’ as the obligations of Union importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold in relation to their management systems, risk management, independent third-party audits and disclosure of information with a view to identifying and addressing actual and potential risks linked to conflict-affected and high-risk areas to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts associated with their sourcing activities.
The regulation defines ‘supply chain due diligence scheme’ as a combination of voluntary supply chain due diligence procedures, tools and mechanisms, including independent third-party audits, developed and overseen by governments, industry associations or groupings of interested organisations.
The regulation defines ‘recycled metals’ as reclaimed end-user or post-consumer products, or scrap processed metals created during product manufacturing, including excess, obsolete, defective, and scrap metal materials which contain refined or processed metals that are appropriate for recycling in the production of tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold. For the purposes of this definition, minerals partially processed, unprocessed or a by-product from another ore are not considered to be recycled metals.
The regulation defines ‘by-product’ as a mineral or metal falling within the scope of this Regulation that has been obtained from the processing of a mineral or metal falling outside the scope of this Regulation, and which would not have been obtained without the processing of the primary mineral or metal falling outside the scope of this Regulation.
The regulation defines ‘verifiable date’ as a date which can be verified by the inspection of physical date stamps on products or of inventory lists.
Union importers of minerals or metals must comply with the supply chain due diligence obligations set out in the regulation and keep documentation demonstrating their respective compliance with those obligations, including the results of the independent third-party audits.
Member State competent authorities are responsible for carrying out appropriate ex-post checks pursuant to Article 11 of the regulation.
Union importers of minerals or metals must:
adopt, and clearly communicate to suppliers and the public up-to-date information on, their supply chain policy for the minerals and metals potentially originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas;
incorporate in their supply chain policy standards against which supply chain due diligence is to be conducted consistent with the standards set out in Annex II to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance;
structure their respective internal management systems to support supply chain due diligence by assigning responsibility to senior management, in cases where the Union importer is not a natural person, to oversee the supply chain due diligence process as well as maintain records of those systems for a minimum of 5 years;
strengthen their engagement with suppliers by incorporating their supply chain policy into contracts and agreements with suppliers consistent with Annex II to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance;
establish a grievance mechanism as an early-warning risk-awareness system or provide such mechanism through collaborative arrangements with other economic operators or organisations, or by facilitating recourse to an external expert or body, such as an ombudsman;

quantities and dates of extraction, if available, expressed in volume or weight;
where minerals originate from conflict-affected and high-risk areas or, where other supply chain risks as listed in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance have been ascertained by the Union importer, additional information in accordance with the specific recommendations for upstream economic operators, as set out in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, such as the mine of mineral origin, locations where minerals are consolidated, traded and processed, and taxes, fees and royalties paid;
operate a chain of custody or supply chain traceability system that provides, supported by documentation, the following information:
description of the metal, including its trade name and type;
name and address of the supplier to the Union importer;
name and address of the smelters and refiners in the supply chain of the Union importer;
if available, records of the third-party audit reports of the smelters and refiners, or evidence of conformity with a supply chain due diligence scheme recognised by the Commission pursuant to Article 8;
if the records referred to in point (iv) are not available:
countries of origin of the minerals in the supply chain of the smelters and refiners;
where metals are based on minerals originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas, or other supply chain risks as listed in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance have been ascertained by the Union importer, additional information in accordance with the specific recommendations for downstream economic operators set out in that Guidance;

CUSTOMS PROGRAMME — establishing the Customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs
The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/444 establishing the Customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs. The programme replaces the Customs 2020 programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1294/2013.
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE?
The Customs 2020 programme has been successful in improving the effectiveness of customs cooperation between the customs authorities of the Member States of the European Union (EU). It is therefore appropriate to establish a new Customs programme, which will continue to support the customs authorities and help them work together and act as one.
KEY POINTS
The programme supports the customs union and the customs authorities working together and acting as one to protect the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the EU and to protect the EU from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity.
The programme supports the following:
the preparation and uniform implementation of customs legislation and policy;
customs cooperation;
administrative and IT capacity building, including human competency and training, as well as the development and operation of electronic systems;
innovation in the area of customs policy.
The financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for the period 2021–2027 is €950 million in current prices. This amount may also cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It may also cover expenses linked to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions that are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme.
The programme is open to the participation of the following third countries:
acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union programmes established in the respective framework agreements and Association Council decisions, or in similar agreements and in accordance with the specific conditions laid down in agreements between the Union and those countries;
European Neighbourhood Policy countries, in accordance with the general principles and general terms and conditions for the participation of those countries in Union programmes established in the respective framework agreements and Association Council decisions or in similar agreements and in accordance with the specific conditions laid down in agreements between the Union and those countries;
other third countries, in accordance with the conditions laid down in a specific agreement covering the participation of the third country to any Union programme, provided that the agreement:
ensures a fair balance as regards the contributions and benefits of the third country participating in the Union programmes;
lays down the conditions of participation in the programmes, including the calculation of financial contributions to individual programmes, and their administrative costs;
does not confer on the third country any decision-making power in respect of the Union programme;
guarantees the rights of the Union to ensure sound financial management and to protect its financial interests.
The programme shall be implemented under direct management in accordance with the Financial Regulation. It may provide funding in any of the forms laid out in the Financial Regulation, in particular by means of grants, prizes, procurement and the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by external experts.
Only actions implementing the objectives set out in Article 3 shall be eligible for funding. Actions complementing or supporting the actions implementing the objectives set out in the Customs Control Equipment Instrument Regulation shall also be eligible for funding under the programme.
The actions referred to in the previous paragraph shall include the following:
meetings and similar ad hoc events;
project-based structured collaboration, such as collaborative IT development by a group of Member States;
IT capacity-building actions, in particular the development and operation of electronic systems;
human-competency and other capacity-building actions, including training and exchange of best practices;
support actions and other actions, including:
studies;
innovation activities, in particular proof-of-concepts, pilot projects, prototyping initiatives, smart data mining and collaboration among systems;
jointly developed communication actions;
any other actions provided for in the work programmes referred to in Article 12, which are necessary for attaining, or are in support of, the objectives set out in Article 3.
The programme may provide funding in any of the forms laid out in the Financial Regulation, in particular by means of grants, prizes, procurement and the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by external experts.
