Ensuring the security of gas supply in the EU Ensuring the security of gas supply in the EU SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 — measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It aims to safeguard the security of gas supply in the EU by ensuring the proper and continuous functioning of the internal market in natural gas (‘gas’), by allowing for exceptional measures to be implemented when the market can no longer deliver the gas supplies required, including solidarity measure of a last resort, and by providing for the clear definition and attribution of responsibilities among natural gas undertakings, the EU countries and the EU regarding both preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of gas supply. KEY POINTS The regulation establishes a gas coordination group (GCG) to facilitate the coordination of measures concerning the security of gas supply. The GCG is composed of representatives of the EU countries, in particular representatives of their competent authorities, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators), the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and representative bodies of the industry concerned and those of relevant customers. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to amend the templates set out in Annexes VI and VII to reflect the evolution of the major transnational risks to the security of gas supply in the EU and its impact on EU countries, taking into account the result of Union-wide simulation of gas supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios carried out by ENTSOG in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. EU countries must notify the Commission the first common risk assessment once agreed by all EU countries in the risk group and the national risk assessments. Each EU country must ensure that the necessary measures are taken so that in the event of a disruption of the single largest gas infrastructure, the technical capacity of the remaining infrastructure, determined in accordance with the N – 1 formula as set out in Annex II, is able, without prejudice to the responsibility of the transmission system operators to make the corresponding investments and to the obligations of transmission system operators as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 and Directive 2009/73/EC.

Harmon Harmon Harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index Harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2016/792 on harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It lays down a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at EU and national level. KEY POINTS Harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and the house price index (HPI) are designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across EU countries. The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. The harmonised indices are annually chain-linked Laspeyres-type indices. The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. Neither the HICP nor the HICP-CT shall cover transactions between households, except in the case of rentals paid by tenants to private landlords, where the latter act as market producers of services purchased by households (tenants). The OOH price index is compiled, where possible and provided that the data are available, for the 10 years preceding the entry into force of this regulation. The harmonised indices are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. Neither the HICP nor the HICP-CT shall cover transactions between households, except in the case of rentals paid by tenants to private landlords, where the latter act as market producers of services purchased by households (tenants).

Protection protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union (EU) Protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union (EU) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 — protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union (codification) WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out rules on the calculation of the normal value (i.e. the price paid or payable for a product in the ordinary course of trade in the EU) and on the imposition of provisional and definitive anti-dumping duties. KEY POINTS An anti-dumping duty may be imposed on any dumped product whose release for free circulation in the EU causes injury. A product is to be considered as being dumped if its export price to the EU is less than a comparable price for a like product, in the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country. The exporting country must normally be the country of origin. However, it may be an intermediate country, except where, for example, the products are merely transhipped through that country, or the products concerned are not produced in that country, or there is no comparable price for them in that country. The normal value may be established on the basis of prices of other sellers or producers. However, where the exporter in the exporting country does not produce or does not sell the like product, the normal value may be established on the basis of prices of other sellers or producers. When there are no or insufficient sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like product must be calculated on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits, or on the basis of the export prices, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that those prices are representative. A definitive anti-dumping duty may be imposed on products which were entered for consumption no more than 90 days prior to the date of application of provisional measures but not prior to the initiation of the investigation, provided that the expiry would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and/or that the injury would be unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were removed or varied, or that the existing measure is no longer, sufficient to counteract the dumping which is causing injury.

Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions Interchange fees for card-based payment transactions SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It aims to remove obstacles to the proper functioning of the EU’s internal market for card-based payments and internet and mobile payments based on cards. KEY POINTS Payment service providers must not offer or request a per transaction interchange fee of more than 0,2 % of the value of the transaction for any debit card transaction. For domestic debit card transactions, EU countries may either: define a per transaction percentage interchange fee cap lower than the one provided for in paragraph 1 and may impose a fixed maximum fee amount as a limit on the fee amount resulting from the applicable percentage rate; or allow payment service providers to apply a per transaction interchange fee of no more than 0,05, or, in the EU whose currency is not the euro, the corresponding value in the national currency on 8 June 2015, which shall be revised every 5 years or whenever there is a significant variation in exchange rates. This per transaction interchange fee may also be combined with a maximum percentage rate of no more than 0,2 %, provided always that the sum of interchange fees of the payment card scheme does not exceed 0,2 % of the total annual transaction value of the domestic debit card transactions within each payment card scheme. For domestic credit card transactions, EU countries may define a lower per transaction percentage interchange fee cap lower than the one provided for in paragraph 1 and may impose a fixed maximum fee amount as a limit on the fee amount resulting from the applicable percentage rate; or allow payment service providers to apply a per transaction interchange fee of no more than 0,05, or, in the EU whose currency is not the euro, the corresponding value in the national currency on 8 June 2015, which shall be revised every 5 years or whenever there is a significant variation in exchange rates. This per transaction percentage interchange fee cap may also be combined with a maximum percentage rate of no more than 0,05, or, in the EU whose currency is not the euro, the corresponding value in the national currency on 8 June 2015, which shall be revised every 5 years or whenever there is a significant variation in exchange rates.

Statistics statistics at EU level Rail transport statistics at EU level SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2018/643 on rail transport statistics WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at EU level. KEY POINTS EU countries must report statistics which relate to rail transport on their national territory. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one EU country, the national authorities concerned must provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled. EU countries may exclude from the scope of the regulation: railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours; railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one EU country, the national authorities concerned must provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled. EU countries must define a set of network segments to include at least the rail trans-European network (TEN) on their national territory. They must communicate to Eurostat: the geographical coordinates and other data needed to identify and map each network segment as well as the links between segments; information on the characteristics (including the capacity) of the trains using each network segment; each network segment which is part of the rail trans-European network must be identified by means of an additional attribute in the data record, in order to enable traffic on the rail TEN to be quantified. EU countries must report data for companies that have: a total volume of goods transport of at least 200 000 tonne-km or at least 500 000 tonnes; a total volume of passenger transport of at least 100 000 passenger-km. EU countries must report under Annexes I and II data for undertakings that have: a total volume of goods transport of at least 200 000 tonne-km or at least 500 000 tonnes; a total volume of passenger transport of at least 100 000 passenger-km. EU countries must report under Annexes III and IV data for companies that have: a total volume of goods transport of at least 200 000 tonne-km or at least 500 000 tonnes; a total volume of passenger transport of at least 100 000 passenger-km. EU countries must designate a public or private organisation to participate in collecting the data required. The necessary data may be obtained using any combination of the following sources: compulsory surveys; administrative data, including data collected by regulatory authorities, in particular the rail freight waybill if one is available; statistical estimation procedures; data supplied by professional organisations in the rail industry; ad hoc studies. The national authorities must take measures for the coordination of the data sources used and to ensure the quality of the statistics transmitted to Eurostat. The Commission adopts implementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements, structure, periodicity and comparability elements for the standard quality reports. Reports on implementation By 31 December 2020 and every 4 years thereafter, the Commission, after consulting the European Statistical System Committee, shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this regulation and on future developments.

Protection of injuriously priced vessels Protection of injuriously priced vessels SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 on protection against injurious pricing of vessels WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out rules for the investigation of injuriously priced vessel sales in the EU. KEY POINTS Scope The regulation applies to the sale of a vessel to a buyer other than a buyer of the country in which the vessel originates. A vessel is to be considered as being injuriously priced if the export price of the vessel sold is less than a comparable price for a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, when sold to a buyer of the exporting country. The normal value must normally be based on the price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for a like vessel by an independent buyer in the exporting country. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel must be calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative.

Enforcement enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area Enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 1173/2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out a system of sanctions for enhancing the enforcement of the preventive and corrective parts of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in the euro area. KEY POINTS The regulation applies to EU countries whose currency is the euro. Sanctions in the preventive part of the SGP apply to EU countries whose currency is the euro. Sanctions in the corrective part of the SGP apply to EU countries whose currency is the euro. Interest-bearing deposits If the Council decides that an excessive deficit exists in a Member State which has lodged an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission, the Commission must, within 20 days of adoption of the Council’s decision, recommend that the Council reduce the amount of the deposit or cancel it. If the Council, acting under Article 126(6) TFEU, decides that an excessive deficit exists in a Member State which has lodged an interest-bearing deposit with the Commission in accordance with Article 4(1) of this regulation, or where the Commission has identified particularly serious non-compliance with the budgetary policy obligations laid down in the SGP, the Commission must, within 20 days of adoption of the Council’s decision, recommend that the Council, by a further decision, require the Member State concerned to lodge with the Commission an interest-bearing deposit amounting to 0,2 % of its GDP in the preceding year. If the Council, acting under Article 126(12) TFEU, decides that a Member State has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit, the Commission must, within 20 days of that decision, recommend that the Council, by a further decision, impose a fine, amounting to 0,2 % of the Member State’s GDP in the preceding year. If the amount of the fine exceeds the amount of a non-interest-bearing deposit lodged in accordance with Article 5, or if no non-interest-bearing deposit has been lodged, the Member State shall make up the shortfall when it pays the fine. The Court of Justice of the European Union has unlimited jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Council imposing fines. Sanctions concerning the manipulation of statistics Sanctions concerning the manipulation of statistics The Council, acting on a recommendation by the Commission, may decide to impose a fine on a Member State that intentionally or by serious negligence misrepresents deficit and debt data relevant for the application of Articles 121 or 126 TFEU, or for the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU. The Commission may conduct all investigations necessary to establish the existence of the misrepresentations.

Single Single Single Resolution Mechanism (SSM) Single Resolution Mechanism (SSM) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 — uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out the rules and procedures for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund. KEY POINTS The Single Resolution Mechanism (SSM) is the single supervisory mechanism established by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 to ensure that the EU’s policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in the euro area Member States and those non-euro area Member States who choose to participate in the SSM (the ‘participating Member States’), and that those credit institutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality. The single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in the euro area Member States and those non-euro area Member States who choose to participate in the SSM (the ‘participating Member States’), and that those credit institutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality. This ensures that authorities have the tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the institution’s critical financial and economic functions while minimising the impact of an institution’s failure on the economy and financial system.

Statistics statistics on education and lifelong learning Statistics on education and lifelong learning SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EC) No 452/2008 concerning the production and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics in the field of education and lifelong learning. KEY POINTS The regulation applies to the production of statistics in three domains: education and training systems; education and training participation of adults in lifelong learning; other statistics on education and lifelong learning, such as statistics on human capital and on the social and economic benefits of education, not covered by domains 1 and 2. The production of Community statistics in the field of education and lifelong learning is implemented by individual statistical actions as follows: the regular delivery of statistics on education and lifelong learning by the EU countries, within specified deadlines for domains 1 and 2; the use of other statistical information systems and surveys, to provide additional statistical variables and indicators on education and lifelong learning, corresponding to domains 3; the development, improvement and updating of standards and manuals on statistical frameworks, concepts and methods; the improvement of data quality, in the context of the quality framework, to include: — relevance, — accuracy, — timeliness and punctuality, — accessibility and clarity, — comparability, and — coherence. The Commission (Eurostat) must seek cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on concepts, definitions, data collection format, data processing, periodicity and deadlines for transmission of results; for Domain 2, the results from the Adult Education Pilot Survey performed between 2005 and 2007 and further development needs; for Domain 3, the availability, suitability and the legal context of existing Community data sources after an exhaustive examination of all existing data sources. If necessary, limited derogations and transition periods for one or more EU countries, both to be based upon objective grounds, must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure. FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY? It has applied since 20 April 2008. BACKGROUND For more information, see: Education and training statistics (European Commission). KEY TERMS Education: organised and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Lifelong learning: all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective.

Cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings Cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 on facilitating cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings and amending Regulations (EU) No 345/2013, (EU) No 346/2013 and (EU) No 1286/2014 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It establishes uniform rules on the publication of national rules concerning marketing requirements for collective investment undertakings and on marketing communications addressed to investors, as well as common principles concerning fees and charges levied on managers of collective investment undertakings in relation to their cross-border activities. It also provides for the establishment of a central database on the cross-border marketing of collective investment undertakings. KEY POINTS A manager of a qualifying venture capital fund may engage in pre-marketing in the EU, except where the information presented to potential investors: is sufficient to allow investors to commit to acquiring units or shares of a particular qualifying venture capital fund; amounts to subscription forms or similar documents whether in a draft or a final form; amounts to constitutional documents, a prospectus or offering documents of a not-yet-established qualifying venture capital fund in a final form. Where a draft prospectus or offering documents are provided, they shall not contain information sufficient to allow investors to take an investment decision and clearly state that: they do not constitute an offer or an invitation to subscribe to units or shares of a qualifying venture capital fund; and the information presented therein should not be relied upon because it is incomplete and may be subject to change. A third party must only engage in pre-marketing on behalf of an authorised manager of a qualifying venture capital fund where it is authorised as an investment firm in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on European social entrepreneurship funds (OJ L 115, 25.4.2013, pp. 18-19).
