Hosting service providers and users’ trust in the online environment — transparency and mutual recognition of information
Hosting services providers and customers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 on the transparency of information on the identification and removal of terrorist content
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that hosting service providers (HSPs) and users have the same level of transparency when identifying and removing terrorist content on the internet.
It also aims to improve the functioning of the EU’s digital single market.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all hosting services in the EU. It does not apply to content provided by third parties, such as the internet hosting service provider (HSP).
It does not affect the right of users to access the content they wish to see or to have access to.
To identify and remove terrorist content, the competent authorities of an EU country must:
identify the content as terrorist material;
decide whether the material constitutes ‘terrorist content’;
take the necessary measures to remove the content;
establish a contact point in the country where the content provider has their main establishment or where their legal representative resides.
The competent authorities must notify the service provider of the reason for the decision and the time of the removal or disabling of the content.
If the competent authority considers that the content does not constitute terrorist material, it may issue a ‘removal order’, which is issued by the EU country in which the content is hosted.
When a competent authority issues a removal order, it must inform the service providers of the reasons for the order. The reasons provided should not imply the disclosure of sensitive information which could jeopardise ongoing investigations.
Service providers that have taken action or were required to take action pursuant to this regulation in a given calendar year should make publicly available annual transparency reports containing information about action taken in relation to the identification or removal of terrorism content. These reports should be made available to the public, including the names and contact details of competent authorities.
In the event that a service provider fails to comply with a competent authorities’ request, it has the right to an effective remedy, which may include:
the removal of the service or the disabling of access to that service or access to which has been disabled;
the refund of the cost of the services or the loss of the revenue from the service;
a ban on the use of that service.
FROM WHEN DOES IT APPLY?
Directive 2013/13/EU introduced a new framework for the transparency and communication of information concerning the identification of terrorist material and the removal of such material. It was amended by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/853 on the protection of personal data.
BACKGROUND

KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down rules for applying the GATT’s rules on trade in goods and measures to protect the intellectual property of EU countries.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (Euratom) No 181/2008.
Importers must notify the Commission of any imports they consider to be being dumped on the EU market.
The Commission decides whether to impose an anti-defection duty on the imports of a product or a product of an EU country.
If the Commission suspects that the imports are being dumped, it may impose a duty on them. It may also impose a provisional duty on imports if there is reason to believe that an undertaking is being breached, or in the case of breach or withdrawal of an undertaking, where the investigation has not been concluded.
An EU countries may request the Commission to carry out a verification visit to check whether the dumping is being carried out.
EU countries must inform the Commission within 3 months of the start of the verification visit and within 3 years of the conclusion of the investigation.
In the event of a breach, the Commission may decide to impose provisional or definitive duties on the import of the product or product of the exporting country if:
the dumping is directly or indirectly controlled by a third person;
the dumped imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within such a market;
there is a risk that the dumped imports will adversely affect the production of a third party.
A provisional duty may be imposed if the Commission considers that the dumping practices are being committed by:
a third party;
an EU country has a dominant position in the market; or
the third party has a significant market share in the EU.
Provisional duties may not be imposed for a period longer than 9 months and may be extended for a further 9 months or they may be suspended for 9 months if they are found to have been breached.
Duties may also be imposed on imports of certain goods if they:
have a significant adverse effect on the production or export price of the importing country;
are not being produced in the country concerned;
have been produced in a way that is contrary to the interests of the producer of the imported product;
contribute to the development of a competitive market or to the growth of the economy of the country in question;

Summary 24:
Countervailing duties on imports of certain products — EU countries and exporters — rules on how they are applied
Combating unfair competition — EU governments’ subsidies on imports — rules for applying them
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on the application of the principle of countervailing duty on imports
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the application by EU countries of a principle of anti-subsidisation (countervailing* duties) to certain products imported from non-EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Direct subsidies
The principle of subsidisation is the principle that a government or an industry receiving a subsidy is entitled to receive a countervailable amount of money from the government of an EU country or an exporter.
The amount of the subsidy must be calculated by spreading the subsidy across a period which reflects the normal depreciation of such assets in the industry concerned.
It does not apply to indirect subsidies (i.e. subsidies that are not directly linked to the acquisition or future acquisition of fixed assets).
The regulation lays down the conditions for determining whether a company or industry receives a subsidy.
In the event of a decision to grant a subsidy, EU countries must notify the European Commission within 3 weeks of receiving the request. The Commission then carries out a verification visit to the company or exporter to check that it has not received a subsidy or that it is not receiving one.
If a company does not comply with the EU country’s request, it must inform EU countries or exporters of the reasons for the decision.
EU countries or companies that have received the subsidy
The Commission then decides whether to grant the subsidy or to suspend it.
Importers and importers must inform the Commission of the reason for the suspension or suspension of a subsidy and provide the Commission with a copy of the decision or the reasons why.
A decision to suspend a subsidy may be taken by the Commission on the basis of information provided by the companies or the exporters.
Disclosure of the essential facts and considerations to parties which qualify for such treatment
The European Commission must make a decision on which companies or companies do not qualify for a subsidy within a time limit which allows them to defend their interests within the EU. The decision may be made by the European Parliament, the Council or the European Economic and Social Committee (EASC).

BACKGROUND
Direct and indirect subsidies
Direct government subsidies are the main source of subsidies in the EU for the production of goods and services of an industry. They are known as ‘subsidies’.
Direct subsidy is a form of indirect government support for a particular sector of the economy, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, forestry and aquaculture, which is intended to reduce the price of those products to a significant degree or prevent price increases, which would otherwise have occurred.
Indirect subsidies are a type of direct government support to a sector of an economy that is not directly related to the production or export of goods or services of that industry.

External aid for the western Balkans (IPSA III 2021 - 2027)
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/941 — framework for planning and delivering external assistance
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out a framework for the EU’s external assistance to the Western Balkan countries for the period between 2021 and 2027.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the framework for EU funding to the beneficiaries of the pre-accession financial assistance (pre-IPA II) and the rural development assistance (RDA) programmes.
The European Commission is responsible for implementing the IPA III programme and the RDA programmes, which are managed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
The IPA III is the third phase of the IPA programme, which began in 2014 and runs until 2027, and aims to improve the quality of life of the beneficiaries and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in the countries covered by the IPA II programme.
Actions under IPA III must be consistent with the principle of ‘do no harm’ and should comply with EU taxonomy to the extent possible, in particular to ensure the sustainability of investments in the areas covered by IPA III.
In order to achieve these objectives, the EU provides financial support to beneficiaries in the following areas:
promoting democracy and human rights;
supporting the fight against organised crime and corruption;
strengthening civil society and cooperation with local authorities;
improving the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the independence of the judiciary;
protecting the integrity of the judicial system;
encouraging the development of the private sector;
developing the capacity of local authorities to tackle corruption and abuse of power;
facilitating the exchange of information;
providing technical assistance;
contributing to research and development;
exchange of information on the beneficiaries’ progress;
assisting in the implementation of projects, programmes and initiatives.
Implementation
The EU provides the beneficiaries with a strategic board to advise the Commission on the strategic and budgetary commitments to the programme. The strategic board is composed of representatives of beneficiaries, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and is chaired by the Commission. Participation in the meetings of the strategic board must be voluntary.
Each beneficiary is assessed on its own merits. In the case of a significant regression or persistent lack of progress by a beneficiary listed in Annex I, the scope and intensity of assistance may be modulated accordingly, including by reducing the funds proportionally and redirecting them in ways that avoid compromising support for improving fundamental rights, democracy and rule of the law, including support to civil society.
Annex II of the regulation provides for the establishment of a programming framework and general principles for IPA III, as well as financial instruments and guarantees for external actions.

Multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2014-2020
Multiannational financial framework for the years 2014-20
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 552/2013 on the duration of the Multiannual Financial Framework
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the annual appropriations for the European Union (EU)’s (now the EU) multiannual budgetary framework for a period of 7 years starting on 1 January 2014.
KEY POINTS
The MFF is designed to provide the EU with the financial resources it needs to prepare and implement medium-term investment programmes.
The European Commission sets the MFF ceilings for each of the years covered by the framework. These ceilings are set out in the regulation.
Each year, the Commission must submit a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council on the annual MFF appropriations to be made. The proposals must be submitted by 1 May of the following year. The Commission then decides on the total appropriations for payments for the year.
In the case of a reduction in the ceiling, the European Commission may propose that the difference be financed through the annual amounts made available for the previous year. If the Commission does not propose this, the Parliament and Council must decide on the amount to be financed by the Commission.
Every 3 years, the EU must submit its proposals to the Commission for the annual allocations for the following years. These proposals must include the total amounts for the contributions from the general budget of the EU to those projects and, in particular, their orderly progression in relation to the appropriations for commitments.
These proposals are submitted to the Council and the Parliament for approval.
If the Commission decides that the annual budgetary allocations for a given year do not meet the ceilings set by the EU, it must propose a technical adjustment to the EU budget. This technical adjustment is known as the ‘adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes’.
This regulation sets out how the EU finances its own resources. The EU must respect the own resources ceiling by ensuring that it does not exceed the amount of own resources it receives from the EU.
A Contingency Margin of up to 0.03 % of the Gross National Income of the Union must be constituted outside the ceilings of the framework, as a last-resort instrument to react to unforeseen circumstances.
An Emergency Aid Reserve is set up to provide financial assistance in the event of major disasters occurring on the territory of an EU Member State or of a candidate country.

SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — measures to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to prevent and combat the illicit manufacture, importation, export and transit of firearms in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to the export, processing and control of firearms and their parts to the EU.
It does not apply to transfers of firearms for civilian use within the EU, while this regulation focuses on measures in respect of export from the customs territory of the acquisition and possession of weapons.
EU countries must ensure that:
the importing country has authorised the shipment of firearms;
the exporting country has notified the exporting country of any objection to the shipment; and
the third countries of transit have given notice in writing or at the latest prior to shipment that they do not object to the transit.
Importers must obtain a European Firearms Pass (EFC Pass) from the competent authorities of the EU country where the exporter is established.
The EFC Pass must be accompanied by the relevant customs importation documents and must be issued by the competent customs authorities of that EU country.
An export authorisation must be granted by the country of origin. The exporter has the power to determine the sending of the item out of the country where it is established and the person responsible for sending it out of that country must have the power for determining the sending out the item.
If an export contract has not been concluded or if the holder of the contract does not act on its own behalf, the person who has the decision-making power must be notified of the decision to send the item to the exporting EU country by means of a written contract or by electronic means.
Exporters may not export firearms which have been rendered permanently unfit for use by deactivation, ensuring that all essential parts of the firearm are rendered permanently inoperable and incapable of removal, replacement or modification that would permit the firearm to be reactivated in any way.
In order to obtain an EFCP, EU countries must take into account all relevant considerations including, where appropriate:
their obligations and commitments as parties to the relevant international export control arrangements or relevant international treaties;
considerations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP;

Issuing of euro coins and collector coins
Issuing and circulationisation of euros
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the issuing and circulationization of coins in the euro area.
KEY POINTS
EU countries may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collectors coins.
The circulation coins are legal tender in all EU countries whose currency is the euro.
Collector coins are not legal tender, but may be put on the market above face value if justified by the special quality of the coin, a special packaging or any additional services provided.
Issuance of circulation coins
Each EU country may issue 2-euro commemorative coins to celebrate specific subjects, subject to limits set per year and per issuing EU country for the number of issues of such coins. The issuances of collector coins must be accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.
In order to avoid that euro collector coins are destroyed by one EU country while there may be a need for such coins in another, EU countries should consult each other prior to the destruction of them.
Decision whether to issue commemorative or circulation coins with a common design collectively issued by all the EU countries must be taken by the Council.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
  
It has applied since 1 January 2011.

The social security system in each EU country is governed by national legislation.
A person who has been a victim of a serious accident or a disease is entitled to benefits under the national legislation of the country in which he or she is resident. If a person has received social welfare assistance in one Member State during a period in which they were entitled to benefit under the legislation of another Member State, the body which provided the assistance may, if it is legally entitled to reclaim the benefits due to the person.

An EU country must notify the national authority of the person who was the victim of the accident and the institution responsible for paying the benefits to that person. The person concerned must provide the relevant information to the relevant national authority. The national authority must then inform the contact institution of the last Member State to whose legislation the claimant was last compulsorily subject before that period.
If the person does not provide the information, the national authorities of the two Member States must inform the institution of which he/she is a resident and inform it of the reasons for the refusal to do so. If the person fails to provide information, this Article applies at the initiative of the institution designated by the competent authority of that Member State of residence as soon as it is appraised of that person’s situation, possibly via another institution concerned.
Disputes concerning the occupational nature of the injury or disease may be settled by the body providing the assistance or the body that paid the benefits.
When a dispute arises between the two parties, the competent authorities of both parties must take the necessary actions to resolve the dispute.

Out-of-court dispute resolution (ODR) for online sales and service contracts (ODRs)
Out of court dispute resolution(ODRs) — online sales or service contracts
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — out-of court dispute redress for online sellers and service providers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to provide consumers with a single point of entry to resolve disputes with online sellers or service providers.
KEY POINTS
Directive 2013/11/EU sets out the rules for the out of court resolution of disputes between consumers and traders.
The regulation applies to online sales* and service* contracts.
It does not apply to disputes between traders and consumers where the consumer is habitually resident in the EU country where the contract is concluded.
EU countries must ensure that consumers have the right to access the judicial system in the event of a dispute over an online sale or service contract.
In addition, EU countries must set up a dispute resolution system (DRS).
The ODR platform provides consumers with an online dispute resolution tool. It allows them to lodge a complaint against an online seller or service provider and to have the dispute resolved by an ADR (advisory and dispute resolution) entity.
Disputes can be resolved by either the consumer or the ADR entity, if:
the consumer has not been able to prove that the seller or the service provider is liable;
the trader has not complied with the conditions of the contract; or

The European Union’s (EU) common agricultural policy (CAP) — the basic and area-based payments for farmers
the European Union's common agriculture policy for farmers — the basis for the European Union Agricultural Fund (EUAFRIC)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 561/2013 on the basic payment scheme
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the basic payments system for farmers in the EU.
It aims to ensure that EU countries’ governments provide the same level of financial support to farmers across the EU, irrespective of whether they are natural or legal persons.
KEY POINTS
Direct payments
The basic payment system is based on a fixed percentage of the gross national product (GNP) for each EU country.
The level of support is calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic scheme by the total number of young farmers applying for direct payments for the year 2014.
Each EU country decides how much it will grant to each farmer for each hectare of land under the basic system for the 2014-2020 period.
In order to promote the sustainable development of agriculture in areas with specific natural constraints, EU countries are able to use part of their direct payments ceilings to grant an annual area based payment to all farmers operating in those areas or in some of those areas, where decided by the EU country, where they decide by an EU country or region.
Annex I of the regulation sets out how much each country will grant each farmer in each of the following areas:
the basic payment for 2014 and for the following years:
a minimum of €1.
a maximum of €2.
the annual national ceiling set out in Annex II.
an annual maximum amount of €3.5 million for each country for each year for the period 2015-2020.
A maximum amount for each region of the EU is set by the European Commission.
National authorities must notify the European Parliament and the Council of the total value of all the entitlements, including special entitlements for 2014-2022.
EU countries must also notify the Commission of the number of hectares covered by the special agricultural entitlements and the total amount of support allocated for rural development.

it does not consider the offence to be serious enough to warrant the arrest or surrender of the person; or
it has not taken a final decision on the warrant.
If the country which has issued the warrant does not take a decision on whether to execute the warrant, it must ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender are fulfilled.
Surrender or subsequent extradition
The person concerned must give his/her consent before the competent judicial authorities of that country. The person must be informed of the reasons for refusing to do so and of the consequences of the refusal.
In the event of multiple requests for the same person, the decision as to which of the arrest warrants shall be executed shall be taken by the executing judicial authorities.
A person who has not given his or her consent must be handed over to the country where the warrant was issued for the purpose of prosecution or execution. The country which surrendered the person must inform the other EU countries of the reason for the refusal and the conditions for granting the person's consent.
Procedure
The executing country must inform each other of their competent authorities when it receives a request for the person to surrender or to return him/her.
Each EU country must take the necessary measures to ensure that consent and, where appropriate, renunciation, are established in such a way as to show that the persons concerned has expressed them voluntarily and in full awareness of their rights.
When a person is refused to surrender, he/she may be held in custody for up to 30 days. If the time limits are extended by a further 30 days, the person may be released.
EU countries may continue to apply bilateral or multilateral agreements or return the property without charge to the executing EU country as soon as the criminal proceedings have been terminated.
