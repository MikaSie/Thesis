Generalised system of preferences (GSP) Generalised system of preferences (GSP) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 — applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out the rules for the application of the EU’s generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015. It repeals Regulation (EC) No 732/2008. It replaces Regulation (EC) No 512/2011. KEY POINTS The EU’s generalised system of preferences (GSP) is designed to help developing countries reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.

Agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway on the surrender procedure Agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway on the surrender procedure SUMMARY OF: Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the surrender procedure WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION? The agreement aims to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EU and Iceland and Norway, without prejudice to the rules protecting individual freedom. The decision approves the agreement on behalf of the EU. KEY POINTS The agreement aims to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EU and Iceland and Norway, without prejudice to the rules protecting individual freedom. Iceland and Norway are parties to a number of conventions in the field of extradition, including the European Convention on extradition of 13 December 1957 and the European Convention on the suppression of terrorism of 27 January 1977. The Nordic countries have uniform extradition laws with a common concept of extradition. The level of cooperation under the EU Convention of 10 March 1995 on simplified extradition procedure and of the EU Convention of 27 September 1996 relating to extradition should be maintained where it is not possible to increase it. Decisions on the execution of an arrest warrant as defined by this agreement must be subject to sufficient controls, which means that a judicial authority of the State where the requested person has been arrested should have to take the decision on his or her surrender. The role of central authorities in the execution of an arrest warrant as defined by this agreement should be limited to practical and administrative assistance. The agreement does not prevent a State from applying its constitutional rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to fundamental rights and in particular the right to a fair trial. DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE The agreement entered into force on 21 October 2006. BACKGROUND For more information, see: Iceland and Norway (European Commission).
