Energy labelling of energy-efficient products in the EU (Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012)
Energy Labelling of Energy-Efficient Products in the European Union
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU)* — energy labelling
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the effectiveness of the EU’s energy label* system.
It sets out rules on the labelling and presentation of products to consumers.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all energy-related products placed on the EU market. It covers:
energy-efficient appliances;
household refrigerating appliances; and
electrical appliances.
Labelling
EU countries must ensure that:
the energy label is clearly visible on the packaging of the product;
the label is printed on the product.
The label must include:
a description of the energy efficiency of the appliance;
an indication of the absolute energy consumption;
a list of products that are eligible for the label.
Distributors and dealers must:
ensure that the label and the product information sheet are clearly displayed on the label;
notify the consumer of any changes that may be introduced to the label by means of updates that would be detrimental to the parameters of the label for that unit;
make the product available to the public for free.
Suppliers must ensure the product database is kept up-to-date on the energy consumption of all products on sale in their market.
In addition, EU countries must establish specific product-specific labels and information sheets for specific categories of products, such as:
refrigerating appliances,
electromatic lamps,
air conditioners,
lamp and light bulbs,
cable televisions,
hotels,
water heaters and
gas heaters.
Products may not be sold with a non-rescaled label unless they are:
in compliance with the harmonised standards set out in Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council;
in conformity assessment;
have been certified by the European Commission;
are in compliance with Directive 2009/125/EC on energy efficiency,
have met the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 596/2008 on energy labelled products.
Where a product does not comply with the regulation, the EU country concerned must take the necessary measures to ensure that the product is withdrawn from their market, and inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of a product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonisation standards referred to in Article 9(6) of this regulation, all EU countries shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of the delegated act.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
   
It applies from 1 July 2012. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 July 2016.

Scope
The regulation applies to all EU citizens, regardless of their nationality. It does not apply to EU countries.
The purpose of the regulation is to:
ensure that EU citizens’ personal data can be processed for a wide range of purposes;
protect the rights and interests of citizens;
promote the development of a European information society;
improve the level of data protection of relevant products and services;
encourage the exchange of information between EU citizens and the EU and non-EU countries;
facilitate the sharing of information and exchange of experience and best practice.
EU countries must ensure that:
personal data can only be processed with the consent of the data subject;
the processing is based on EU or EU country law;
data subjects have the right to be informed and to have their personal data protected;
processing is only authorised where it is necessary for the purpose of protecting the rights of the general public or for the prevention, detection and investigation of serious crimes.
Personal data may be processed only where:
the data subject has given consent or the processing is justified by a legitimate public interest;
there is no reason to believe that the processing will harm the privacy of the person concerned;
it is lawful for the processing to be carried out in accordance with the law of an EU country.
Consultation of the supervisory authority
Before processing, the controller must consult the data protection officer, who is designated by the European Commission.
If a processing operation involves a high risk to personal data, a data protection impact assessment is carried out. If the impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a risk which the controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a consultation must take place prior to the processing.
In addition, the data processing must comply with the following rules:
data protection measures must be in place to safeguard the fundamental rights of data subjects, including:
information society services (e.g. access to information and communication services);
access to information society services directly to a child;
protection of the privacy and security of information society users; and
the protection of the confidentiality of information.
Where the processing does not comply with these rules, the processor must inform the controller of the reasons for its decision.
Disputes between controllers and data subjects
The data subject must be informed of the processing and the consequences of any infringement of his/her rights. The data subject is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the processing, provided that full and effective compensation is ensured. In addition, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor.
Conditions for processing
The processing must respect the following conditions:
consent must be given in writing, including in electronic form, for the purposes of:
establishing, exercising or defence of legal claims;
participation in the establishment, exercise and defence of rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest in the EU or of a EU country;
for reasons of public interest.
Data processing may only be authorised if:
a person has given their consent or if it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, and
there are no restrictions on the storage, processing or use of personal information;
personal information is processed for scientific research purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in EU or Member State law.
However, the processing may be subject to certain restrictions, such as:
transfer of data to a third country or an international organisation;
use of data for commercial purposes; or
the transfer of specific categories of data.
Information society services must be designed to facilitate the exercise of fundamental freedoms and to protect the rights, interests and safety of individuals.
Composition and application
The European Commission has adopted a number of implementing acts to ensure the proper application of this regulation. These include:
rules on the use of data processing by the Commission;
rules for the application of EU countries’ national data protection laws;
requests for data protection officers;
measures to be taken by EU countries to protect data subjects’ rights and privacy;
procedures for the exchange and sharing of data between EU countries and the Commission

Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on harmonised indices of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules and procedures for harmonising the Harmonised Consumer Prices of the EU countries.
KEY POINTS
The Harmonized Consumer Prices are used by the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) in their assessment of price stability in the Member States under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Commission uses the HICP in its macroeconomic imbalance procedure, as set out in Article 140(2) of the TFEU.
The harmonised consumer price indices are used in the context of the Commission’s macroeconomic balance of payments procedure.
They are compiled by Eurostat (Eurostat).
Each year, EU countries provide Eurostat with updated sub-index weights for the indices.
Eurostat prepares a report addressing the suitability of the OOH price index for integration into the HicP coverage. If the report establishes that further methodological developments are required for the integration of the index into the coverage, the Commission will pursue the methodological work and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on that work, as appropriate.
EU countries may launch pilot studies, to be carried out on a voluntary basis by EU countries, on the basis of the results obtained from these studies.

Dumping & trade in products: EU Anti-Dumping measures
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/852 — rules on the application of the 1994 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules on dumping and trade-in-goods (‘DAD’) in goods imported into the European Union (EU).
It codifies and repeals Regulation (Euratom) No 552/94, which had to become law in the EU countries by 1994.
KEY POINTS
DAD
The regulation applies to imports of goods from non-EU countries into the EU. It does not apply to:
exports to the EU as a whole;
the EU’s internal market; and
the internal market of EU countries.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
It entered into force on 1 July 2015.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a series of anti-DAD rules since 1994. These aim to protect the EU industry against dumping and to ensure fair competition in the internal market. They include:
rules on the import and export of goods and measures to combat dumping;
rules of procedure for the investigation and enforcement of dumping and the imposition of duties.
For more information, see:
‘Anti-DOD’ on the European Commission's website
’.
* KEY TERMS
* DAD:
Duty: a duty that is imposed on imports of a product by an exporter or a producer.
Prohibition: the practice of dumping is when a product is sold at a lower price than the price it is intended to sell in the domestic market of the country of origin.
Exhibition: when the price of an export is below the price at which it is expected to be sold in that country.
Importers: when an export price is lower than the expected price of the product at the time of importation.
Export prices: the prices at which the exporter intends to sell the product to the end-users.
The Commission:
must investigate allegations of dumping.
Investigations must be initiated on the initiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State or any interested party on the basis of sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out in the regulation.
If the Commission considers that dumping is being practised, it may impose a provisional or definitive duty on imports from the country concerned. The Commission may also impose a duty on the importer or producer if it considers that the dumping is likely to have a detrimental effect on the EU economy.
In the event of a finding of dumping, the Commission may:
suspend or reduce the amount of the duty;
require exporters or producers to revise their prices or to cease exports at dumped prices;
take corrective action to prevent the dumping; or
impose additional duties on imports if the dumping has not been detected.
EU countries must:
ensure that the measures imposed are proportionate and proportionate to the damage caused;
not discriminate between exporters and producers;
allow for exemptions to producers of the products concerned that can demonstrate that they are not related to any producer subject to the duty.
Where an EU country suspects that an EU exporter is dumping, it must lodge a complaint with the Commission. If the Commission finds that there is no evidence of dumping or that there has been a substantial increase in the level of dumping in the case of imports from that country, it is obliged to take appropriate measures.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
The decision has applied since 1 January 2016.

Protection against subsidised imports from non-EU countries and the EU’s internal market
Protection of imports from countries and countries’ internal markets
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidisation from countries not members of the European Community
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to protect the European Union (EU) economy against the unfair subsidisation of imports originating in developing countries*.
It codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC), which had been amended several times.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to imports from:
non-EU and developing countries;
exporters of agricultural products;
producers of agricultural and forestry products.
It does not apply to:
exports of agricultural or forestry products originating in the EU to developing countries or to the EU as a whole;
imports from developing countries.
Investigations and proceedings
EU countries must inform the European Commission of any imports they consider to be the subject of subsidisation or of injury to their industry.
The Commission may launch an investigation if it considers that the imports are likely to constitute a threat to EU industry. It may also launch investigations where the volume of the imports is de minimis or, particularly in the case of developing countries, the injury is negligible, and it is appropriate to define those situations.
If an EU country suspects that an EU exporter or producer is receiving a subsidy, it must immediately communicate its evidence of this to the Commission. It must also inform the Commission of the reasons for its decision.
Where an EU countries have refused to cooperate with the investigation, the Commission may initiate an investigation.
An investigation may be terminated if the amount of the subsidy is negligible or if the EU industry is not in danger of being harmed.
In the event that the Commission concludes that there is no evidence of injury, it may impose a countervailing duty on the exporter. The Commission may also impose a provisional duty on imports which are not subject to an investigation, provided that:
the exporters or producers have not made themselves known;
the amount of countervailable subsidisation is not more than the weighted average amount of subsidies established for the parties in the sample;
there is a risk that the exporters may use a quantity of home market inputs equal to, and having the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs as a substitute for them in order to benefit from the subsidy.
Procedures
The European Commission may:
impose a provisional import duty on an exporter if the import and the corresponding export operations both occur within a reasonable time period, not exceeding 2 years;
suspend a definitive import duty if the imports do not pose a risk to the Union industry;
require an exporters’ or producers’ company to submit information on its production, sales or exports of the products covered by the regulation.
Implementing measures
The EU has adopted a number of implementing measures, including:
rules on the application of the regulation;
measures to protect EU exporters and producers from the effects of the measures imposed by the Commission;
rules to prevent the circumvention of these measures.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
It entered into force on 1 January 2010.

Workers’ rights and parental leave
Workers' rights and paternity leave
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2010/18/EU on the right to leave and paternity
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure equal treatment of men and women at work and family life.
It sets out the rules on parental leave, paternity leave and flexible working arrangements.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must ensure that workers who exercise their right to parental leave receive a payment or an allowance for the duration of their leave.
Paternity leave is granted irrespective of marital or family status, as defined by national law.
The duration of paternity leave is calculated on the basis of the number of consecutive fixed-term contracts that a worker has had with the same employer for the same period of time.
In addition, EU countries are encouraged to encourage the use of work-life balance arrangements by fathers, such as leave or flexible work arrangements, in order to reduce the relative amount of unpaid family work undertaken by women and leave them more time for paid employment.
Employers are required to ensure that men who are entitled to paternity leave do not lose their employment contract or employment relationship as a result of taking such leave. They must be informed of the terms and conditions of their contract of employment and employment relationship.
Women who do not take, or have not taken, leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the directive, or who are dismissed for reasons other than maternity or paternity leave, may request the employer to provide substantiated reasons for their dismissal. The employer must consider and respond to such requests, taking into account the needs of both the employer and the worker.
Flexible working arrangements
EU workers may make the right of flexibility to work from home or work from the premises of their choice, subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification, which may not exceed 6 months.
EU governments must ensure the implementation of these arrangements, which are based on a framework agreement concluded between the social partners and the employer.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
   
It has applied since 2 August 2010. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 2 August 2014.
BACKGROUND
The directive is part of a package of measures designed to promote equal opportunities for men and woman in the labour market.

Summary 52:
EU rules on bluefin tuna fishing
EU controls on bluefish
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the conservation of Atlantic Tunas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out EU rules on the control of bluefish caught in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all EU fishing vessels, including:
fishing vessels and traps;
farmers;
traps;
fattening or farming farms;
transfer and caging operations.
It does not apply to:
the EU fishing fleet;
the European Commission;
EU countries’ fishing vessels;
tourists;
other fishing vessels.
EU rules
EU fishing vessels must:
use transparent and objective criteria, including those of an environmental, social and economic nature, to determine the fishing opportunities available to them;
allocate quotas fairly among the various fleet segments giving consideration to traditional and artisanal fisheries;
use selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact;
apply incentives to European fishing vessels deploying selective and sustainable fishing gear.
Fishing authorisations
Each EU country must issue fishing authorisations for vessels to fish for bluefish in its territory. The number of fishing vessels authorised to fish is based on the total allowable catch and the fishing capacity of the fishing fleet.
Authorisations are valid for a maximum period of 5 years.
Vessels must report to the European Commission electronically every year on the number of fish caught.
The Commission publishes a list of the vessels authorised, by the issuing of a fishing authorisation, to fish in its waters.
FROMISSION
Each year, each EU country sends to the Commission electronically a list to the ICCAT (International Commission for Animal Welfare and Aquaculture) of the EU countries that have authorised fishing vessels or traps to catch bluefish. This list is updated by 15 February each year. The Commission then forwards the list to ICCAT, which then forwards it to the EU country that issued the authorisation.
Inspections
EU vessels are required to carry out inspections at least once a year. They must report the results of these inspections to the competent authorities of their EU country.
If a vessel is found to have committed an infringement of the regulation, it is subject to a penalty of up to €500,000.
Transmission of inspection plans
An EU country’s competent authorities must ensure that vessels carrying out inspections comply with ICCAT rules.
Monitoring of catches
The EU country responsible for monitoring catches must keep a record of all catches and transfers of fish. The data must be kept on board the catching vessel or by the farm or trap operator during its entire period of authorisation and, where appropriate, during the transfer operation.
Catching and transfer of fish must be recorded in a transfer logbook. The master of the vessel must transmit the details of the transfer to the monitoring party. The monitoring party must make such examination of equipment, catch or gear and any relevant documents as an inspector deems necessary to verify the compliance with the Commission's recommendations in force in relation to the bluefin species.
Transfer of fish from a farm to a fishing vessel or to a farm must be reported to the relevant authorities of the country in which the catch was caught. The catch must be transferred to a monitoring party, which must make a report on the transfer and the transfer of the fish to the authorities of that country. If the catch is of insufficient quality, the transfer must be terminated. The transfer must also be recorded on the fishing logbook of the farm.
Reporting of catches by EU countries
Yearly reporting of catches must be submitted to the International Commission on the basis of an annual report. The report must include:
details of the number and weight of fish landed or transshipment;
information on the catch;
a description of the species caught; and
the number of vessels involved in the catch.
Imports, imports, landings, processing and exports from EU countries must comply with the regulation.
Exports from the EU to non-EU countries must be subject to the same rules as those applicable to EU countries in respect of imports, exports and exports of bluefin fish.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
It entered into force on 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a number of measures designed to protect the bluefish stocks of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, including Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.
For more information, see:
Bluefin tuna (European Commission).
KEY TERMS

Summary 53:
Shipbuilding injurious pricing
Shipbuilding injurious pricing (SIPI Code)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 552/2013 on the enforcement of the Shipbuilding Injurious Pricing Code
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 385/96, which had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 2014.
It aims to protect the EU shipbuilding industry against sales of ships below their normal value which cause injury to it.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
shipbuilding contracts for the sale of ships to third countries;
shipownership contracts;
contracts for the re-ownership of ships.
EU countries must ensure that:
ships are sold at a price below the normal value of the shipbuilder’s market price;
the vessel is not resold to an independent buyer or is not in the condition in which it was originally sold, on any reasonable basis.
Injunctions and investigations
Investigations and proceedings must be carried out in accordance with the following rules:
injunctions must be initiated when:
a shipbuilder or a buyer controls a buyer when the person or company is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the buyer, which is presumed at a 25% interest;
a vessel is sold below its normal value, on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits.
investigations must be launched if:
the shipbuilder, the buyer or buyers, representatives of the government of the exporting country, the complainants, and other interested parties, which have made themselves known, present their views in writing and submit information if such views and information are to be taken into account during the investigation.
If the Commission decides to initiate an investigation without having received a written complaint by, or on behalf of, the EU industry for the initiation of such investigation, this must be done on the grounds of sufficient evidence of injury, injury, a causal link, and that a member of the allegedly injured EU industry met the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 (d), to justify such initiation.
The investigation must be concluded no later than 1 year from the date of initiation. It may be terminated where the margin of injury is de minimis.
Investigating parties must be given notice of the information which the authorities require. If the information they provide is not accepted, the supplying party must be informed of the reasons therefor and must be granted an opportunity to provide further explanations within the time limit specified.
Exchanges of information between the Commission and EU countries, or any internal documents prepared by the authorities of the EU or the Member States, must not be divulged except as specifically provided for in the annex to the regulation.
Implementing powers
The Commission may, in exceptional cases, impose sanctions on a shipbuilder if it considers that it has been the subject of an infringement of its intellectual property rights. It must inform the shipowner or buyer of the reason for its decision and inform the other parties concerned, in writing, of the measures taken.
Where the Commission considers that an infringement has been committed, it may impose sanctions, in particular by:
suspending the shipbuilding contract;
prohibiting the sale or re-selling of a vessel to a third country;
restricting the supply of a ship to a non-EU country; or
restricting the sale to an EU country of a similar vessel.

Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament
Rights of Members of Parliament
The rules of procedure apply to the members of Parliament.
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 — Rules of Procedure for the 9th parliamentary term
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the procedure adopted by the EU’s Parliament for the ninth parliamentary term (2009-2019).
It aims to ensure that the Parliament is governed by the principles of democracy, transparency and respect for the rule of law.
KEY POINTS
The European Parliament is the assembly elected pursuant to the Treaties, the Act of 20 September 1976 concerning the election of the members and national legislation deriving from those Treaties.
The procedure applies to:
membership of the Parliament;
the composition of the committees and delegations;
members’ voting rights;
rules of procedure for the Conference of Presidents and the committee responsible for respect for subsidiarity.
Rules of procedure
The Parliament adopts the rules on the basis of a proposal by the Committee of Presidents. The committee responsible is responsible for:
checking the credentials of individual Members who are replacing outgoing Members and may at any time rule on any dispute as to the validity of the mandate of any of its Members;
approving the composition of committees, delegations and committees;
adopting the code of conduct for multilingualism;
drawing up draft recommendations for the amendment of the treaties;
drafting up the text of the basic legislative acts;
preparing the text for the adoption by the committee.
In addition, the committee may:
make recommendations for amendments to the Treaty on European Union (TFEU);
draw up recommendations on the interpretation of the TFEU;
provide opinions on the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon;
take decisions on the use of gender-neutral language in its documents;
ensure that the Commission and the Council of Europe are consulted on matters relating to gender equality and diversity;
hold a joint debate with the European Commission on any questions raised by the Commission or the Council;
make a joint statement on financial management of the EU.
Member-level committees
The committee responsible:
prepares the draft agenda for the parliamentary session;
is responsible for drawing up the final draft agenda of the part-session;
publishes a report every year on the content of the draft legislative act;
advises the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the functioning of the committee;

Each year, the Committee responsible prepares a report on the composition and composition of its committees and committees and on the role of the Bureau of the Council. It also adopts an annual report on its work.
When a Member-level committee or a committee submits a proposal for an amendment to a Treaty, it must submit a report to the committee and to the Council on its implementation. The Committee responsible may, in accordance with the provisions of the Basic legislative act, submit to Parliament a motion for a resolution revoking, in full or in part, that delegation of powers or opposing the tacit extension of that delegation. If, in a single vote, the provisional agreement fails to secure the majority of the component Members of the parliament, it may then proceed to a vote on the adoption of the amendment. If the proposal is not adopted, it is referred to the Commission, which may withdraw it.
If the Commission does not withdraw its proposal, Parliament may refer it back to the committees responsible for the subject-matter, which shall consider it in order to prepare a legally binding act.
Any Member-Level Committee or Committee submits to the Committee a report containing proposals, addressed to the EU Parliament, on the application of the relevant Treaties and on its interpretation and implementation. It may also submit to the European Council a report concerning the interpretation and application of its interpretation.
Where the Committee is consulted pursuant to Article 36 of the treaty on the European Union, the matter may be referred to a committee responsible, which must draw up recommendations pursuant to Rules 46 and 54.
A Member of Parliament may ask for a reasoned opinion from a national parliament. This opinion must be accompanied by short justifications. The Member concerned must be able to give his or her reasons for not being able to attend the hearing, unless he or she has asked to be excused from being heard on the date and at the time proposed, and has given his/her reasons. If a Member of the Commission sends the President of the Court of Justice an opinion on a matter, that opinion must also be accompanied, where appropriate, by short explanations.
Political parties and other interested parties may make a request for a major interpellation. They must be given the opportunity to put a question in turn.

The delegated acts are adopted by the Commission on the basis of a proposal from the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (EU).
The Commission adopts delegated acts on behalf of the EU. The delegated acts may be amended by the EU countries’ governments or the Commission itself.
EU legislation is implemented by delegated acts, which are adopted in the light of the Commission’s work to evaluate and simplify EU legislation and to avoid overregulation and administrative burdens for citizens, administrations and businesses, including SMEs, while ensuring that the objectives of the legislation are met.
Delegation acts are delegated to the Commission for a period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of the basic legislative act or any other date set by the co-legislators. The Commission may decide to revoke the delegated acts if it considers that they do not meet the objectives or that they are not consistent with EU law.
When preparing and drawing up delegated acts for EU legislation, the Commission must ensure a timely and simultaneous transmission of all documents, including the draft acts, to the EU Parliament and Council at the same time as to the Member States’ experts.
In addition, Member States must be consulted in a timely manner on each draft delegated act prepared by Commission services.
Member States must also be consulted on the content of the delegated act.
Where the Commission considers that Member States' experts are needed in the early preparation of draft implementing acts, it will make use of expert groups, consult targeted stakeholders and carry out public consultations, as appropriate.
If the Commission decides to adopt an implementing act, it must explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in terms of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and how they are compatible with fundamental rights.
Public consultations must be conducted in an open and transparent way, and the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation.

The Commission may, on its own initiative, review the process within 3 months of receiving the Commission’s request, if it finds that the noise assessment process does not meet the requirements of the regulation.
If an airport has been identified as having a noise problem, additional noise abatement measures should be identified in accordance with the Balanced Approach methodology. These measures should aim to:
eliorate the noise impact over the same period;
reduce the number of people expected to be affected by the noise;
improve the environmental impact;
ensure the effectiveness of airport operations;
increase the capacity of airport facilities;
deliminate noise at the airport.
EU countries must ensure that the information they provide to the Commission, the EASA and the other interested parties is made available free of charge.
Airport operators must provide the Commission with:
a description of the aircraft noise and performance data;
the general criteria applied when distributing and managing traffic in each airport;
information on alleged infringements due to changes in flight procedures, in terms of their impact and the reasons why such changes were made;
data collected by noise measuring systems, if available.
In addition, EU countries must:
provide the Commission and other relevant interested parties with the following information:
the number of aircraft operating at an airport, including the number and type of aircraft;
airport capacity;
number of passengers expected;
cost-efficiency analysis of the measures to be introduced;
measures to be taken to achieve the airport's objectives;
a report on the outcome of the cost-efficient analysis.
The European Commission may:
review the process for introducing operating restrictions if it considers that they do not comply with the regulation;
notify the relevant authorities and the relevant parties if they find that the process followed for the introduction is not meeting the requirements;
issue a decision to revoke the operating restriction if they consider that it does not conform to the regulation's requirements.

Summary 155:
Securities settlement systems (SSS) — rules for securities settlement systems
Securities settlements systems (CSDs)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on the rules for the establishment and operation of securities-settlement systems
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules on the establishment, operation and supervision of the securities settlement system (CSD) market in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all CSDs* operating in the EU. It does not apply to CSDs that operate in non-EU countries.
EU countries must ensure that CSDs comply with the regulation’s rules on prudential standards and that they have the necessary capital to meet the requirements of the regulation.
The CSDs are regulated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Supervisory Board (ESB) and the European Central Bank (ECB).
The European Commission adopts the regulation on behalf of the EU and adopts implementing technical standards for the CSD market.
Settlement procedures
A CSD must establish procedures that facilitate the settlement of transactions in financial instruments. These procedures are designed to:
ensure that the financial instruments are settled on the intended settlement date;
facilitate the exchange of information between participants in the securities market;
provide participants with the information they need to make a decision on whether to participate in the settlement process;
allow participants to make an investment decision;
inform the competent authorities of the terms and conditions under which a CSD is authorised to provide its services.
In addition, the regulation sets out a list of services that are covered by the regulation, such as:
the rights and obligations of CSDs;
the responsibilities of a central point of contact with other CSDs.
Authorisation and recognition
The competent authority of an EU country must grant authorisation to an applicant CSD if it meets the following conditions:
it has the necessary financial resources to provide the services;
it is based in the country of registration;
its activities are authorised by the competent authority in that country.
If an applicant applies for authorisation in another EU country, it must provide all the relevant information concerning the activities of its CSD that is of relevance to the requesting authority. The competent authority may, at any time, request that the applicant withdraw its authorisation if it considers that the application does not comply with these conditions.
Cooperation
The relevant authorities must cooperate with each other in order to ensure the proper functioning of the CSDs’ systems. This cooperation includes:
establishing and maintaining a communication channel between the relevant authorities;
developing standard forms, templates and procedures for the cooperation;
ensuring that the cooperation is based on a set of principles and principles of prudential principles;
identifying the responsibilities of the central authorities and CSDs in the event of disputes between the authorities.
Compliance with prudential requirements
CSDs are subject to a capital surcharge that reflects the risks, including credit and liquidity risks, resulting from the provision of intra-day credit, inter alia, to the participants in a securities settlement* system or other users of CSD services. This surcharge is calculated on the basis of the market and credit risk as well as the concentration limits on assets held by CSDs and the concentration of assets in the system. The surcharge may be increased or reduced depending on the severity of the risk.

If the executing country does not know the issuing country, it must make the necessary enquiries, in order to obtain that information.
When a requested person is arrested, the requested person must be informed of the warrant and of its contents, and also of the possibility of consenting to surrender to the issuing judicial authority. The requested person may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Articles 5 or 6(2) and 7(2).
If a person renounces his/her consent, he/her renunciation must be formally recorded in the national law of the country in which issued the warrant.
EU countries may decide to apply the extradition system applicable before the entry into force of the agreement in relation to acts committed before a date specified in the EAW.
A decision to execute an arrest warrant must be taken by the executing national judicial authority with due consideration of all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of the offences, the respective dates of the warrants and whether the warrant has been issued for the prosecution or for execution of a custodial sentence or detention order. The decision must be made in writing and the conditions binding on all the authorities in the issuing and executing countries.
Where a person is refused to surrender, he or she must be surrendered no later than 10 days after the final decision on executing the warrant, unless they have been informed of their right to do so before the decision.
