Cross-border access to television and radio programmes Cross-border access to television and radio programmes SUMMARY OF: Directive 2019/36/EU — cross-border access to television and radio programmes WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?

The regulation also covers: annual statistics on goods transport; quarterly statistics on goods and passenger transport; regional statistics on goods and passenger transport; statistics on traffic flows on the rail network. The regulation also sets out the rules for the transmission of statistics to Eurostat. The Commission adopts implementing acts laying down the arrangements for the transmission of the statistics and the arrangements for the dissemination of results. The Commission adopts implementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements, structure, periodicity and comparability elements for the standard quality reports. The Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this regulation and on future developments. FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY? It has applied since 13 December 2018. BACKGROUND For more information, see: ‘Railway statistics’ on the European Commission's website.

It also sets out a binding EU-wide climate target for 2040. KEY POINTS The regulation sets out a binding EU-wide climate target for 2040. It aims to achieve a balance between anthropogenic economy-wide emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases listed in Part 2 of Annex V to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. The EU-wide target is a domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030.

Prohibition of access to certain professions Prohibition of access to certain professions SUMMARY OF: Directive 2018/36/EU on the regulation of certain professions WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE? It aims to ensure that EU countries are able to regulate certain professions within the limits of the principles of non-discrimination and proportionality. It aims to ensure that the rules regulating certain professions are not disproportionate and that they do not affect the EU’s competence. KEY POINTS EU countries must assess the proportionality of their new or amended rules before introducing new, or amending existing, rules restricting access to, or the pursuit of, a regulated profession. The extent of the assessment must be proportionate to the nature, content and impact of the provision. The reasons for considering that a provision is justified and proportionate must be substantiated by qualitative and, wherever possible and relevant, quantitative elements. The EU countries must monitor the compliance of new or amended rules with the principle of proportionality. The EU countries must also make information available to citizens, service recipients and other relevant stakeholders before introducing new, or amending existing, rules restricting access to, or the pursuit of, a regulated profession. The EU countries must also encourage the exchange of information between EU countries on matters covered by this directive and on the particular way that they regulate a profession, or on the effects of such regulation. FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY? It has applied since 30 July 2018. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 30 July 2020.

EU countries must transmit the data and metadata to Eurostat in a format and within transmission deadlines. The data must be delivered no later than on the date of the first data transmission and the breakdowns no more than one year thereafter. EU countries may take part in sample schemes when such schemes create possibilities for substantial reductions in the cost of the statistical systems or the burden on business entailed in meeting the EU requirement. EU countries must submit reports on the quality of the data transmitted to Eurostat within 12 months of the entry into force of the Commission implementing measures. The Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this regulation every 3 years. FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
