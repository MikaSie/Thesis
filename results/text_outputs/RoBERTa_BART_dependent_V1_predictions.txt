Online retranmission of televisual programmes — rights on the internet
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2015/24/EU on the licensing of rights for online retransmissions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to improve the legal framework for broadcasting organisations’ rights to online services that are ancillary to their own broadcasts of television or radio programmes.
It sets out the rules for the licensing and management of the rights to these services.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to:
online services that provide access to programmes broadcast by a broadcasting organisation;
online retranscasts of television programmes originating in other EU countries;
ancillary online services which give access to material that enriches or otherwise expands the content of the broadcasts.
In order to make their online services available across borders, broadcasting organisations need to have the required rights to works and other protected subject matter for all the relevant territories of the EU, which further increases the complexity of the clearance of such rights.
The legislation applies to all broadcasting organisations that provide online services. It does not apply to the broadcasting organisation’s own productions, which are understood as productions carried out by the organisation with the use of its own resources, but excluding productions commissioned by the broadcasting organisations to producers that are independent from the organisation and co-productions.

Rights to the works or other protected subjects used in the programmes, for the online services covered by the directive.
Licensing of rights
The law applies to broadcasting organisations and operators of online services:
operators of broadcasting organisations providing online services;
the collective management organisations of distributors of retransmitters’ services; and
collective management organisations (collective managing organisations) which manage the collective management rights of distributors.
When determining reasonable licensing terms, including the license fee, for a retransmitting in accordance with Directive 2014/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, the economic value of the right to use the rights in trade and the value allocated to the means of the transmission should be taken into account when determining the amount of payment for the rights subject to the country of origin principle, such as methods based on the revenues generated by the online service.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
From 1 January 2016.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a number of measures to modernise the rules governing the broadcasting sector, including:
the directive on the rights of broadcasters;
rules on collective management of rights;
measures to improve cooperation between collective management bodies and distributors;
changes to the rules on licensing rights for retransmisses.

Summary 9:
Sustainable internal market: EU SME programme (2013-2020)
Sustainable Internal market: U2S Programme (2013 - 2020)
This European Union (EU) programme aims to improve the competitiveness, capacity building and sustainability of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
ACT
Council Decision 2013/852/EU of 25 May 2013 establishing the European Union Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Programme.
SUMMARY
The European Union SME Programme is one of the EU’s major achievements and its best asset in an increasingly global world, as well as being a core element in achieving the green and digital transformation towards a sustainable economy, in response to the increasing pressures of climate change.
The programme is based on principles of fairness, transparency and mutual trust. It aims to promote the correct and full implementation by the Member States of the Union legal framework for anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing and the development of future policies to address new challenges in those fields.
In addition, the programme is designed to improve SMEs’ access to finance and to provide them with a more flexible, transparent, simplified and agile framework to finance activities aiming to achieve a well-functioning sustainable internal market.
Objectives
The main objectives of the programme are to:
foster the competitiveness and capacity building of enterprises;
improve the sustainability of SMEs, especially SMEs operating in the tourism sector;
facilitate the access to financing for SMEs;
promote SMEs to the European single market;
strengthen cooperation between Member States and their authorities and courts;
ensure the proper implementation of the legislation underpinning the proper functioning of the internal market; and
improve cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council.
Evaluation and implementation
To achieve its objectives, the Programme will assess whether the existing legislation is fit for purpose and, when new risks emerge, identify potential areas for action. It will also assess whether it is possible to adapt the programme to the needs of the modern economy and to the changing needs of consumers, businesses and employees.
It will also examine the possibility of extending the scope of the Programme to cover new sectors, such as e-commerce and the digital economy.
Financing
The Programme will provide financial support to SMEs in the following areas:
the creation of a European Single Market Information System (SOMIS);
the development of the European Single Digital Gateway (ESG); and
the establishment of the Your Europe Advice, SOLVIT, the Internal Market Information system and the Single Market Scoreboard. The programme will also provide support for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on the European Statistical Programme (ESP).
Sustainability
The aim of this programme is to promote:
a sustainable and inclusive internal market for all citizens and businesses;
a high level of protection for consumers and businesses when goods and services are imported from economic operators based in non-EU countries, including when they are sold online;
access to finance for enterprises, particularly SMEs engaged in services;
encouraging SMEs and social partners to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the programme;
fostering the growth and diversification of the SME sector, especially through the creation of new SMEs with a view to diversifying their sources of income;
supporting SMEs that are experiencing difficulties in accessing finance;
enhancing the capacity of micro-enterprises;
providing support to micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs which are facing difficulties in access to financial resources;
raising awareness of the importance of financial instruments and the need to diversify their financial resources.

SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2014/35/EU on the tracing of firearms, essential components and ammunition
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to ensure the traceability of all firearms* and the protection of the EU’s external borders.
It codifies and repeals Directive 1999/87/EC.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to:
firearms classified in the following categories:
category A: rifles, shotguns, pistols, revolvers and assault rifles;
category B: shotguns, assault rifles, pistols and rifles with a calibre of.22 or smaller, unless they have been converted from automatic firearms.
General rules
EU countries may authorise individuals to acquire and possess firearms in category A for historical, cultural, scientific, technical, educational or heritage purposes, provided that such museums and collectors demonstrate, prior to being granted such an authorisation, that they have taken the necessary measures to address any risks to public security or public order, including by way of proper storage.
Dealers and brokers may not be prevented from handling firearms in categories A, B and C, except in cases where their handling is necessary for the purposes of deactivation or conversion, or where otherwise permitted under this directive.
The activities of a dealer include not only the manufacturing but also the modification or conversion of a firearm, such as the shortening of a complete firearm, leading to a change in their category or subcategory.
In addition, the activities of dealers and brokers must not be considered to be activities that only a dealer would be permitted to undertake.
All firearms or their components must be marked with a clear, permanent and unique marking and registered in the data-filing systems of the Member States.
National authorities must be able to trace the firearms and the essential components after the destruction of the firearms or essential components concerned.
To facilitate their free movement, all firearms must be stamped with a clearly visible, permanent, unique and easily identifiable identification number.
Member States must also ensure that:
all firearms and ammunition classified in category B are marked and registered with the national data-processing systems;
they are registered with national authorities for a period of 30 years after their destruction;
the data are retained for the purpose of administrative and criminal proceedings for up to 30 years.
Authorisations are valid for a maximum period of 10 years after the death of the holder of the firearm or essential component concerned. They may be renewed for an additional period of 5 years if they are necessary for customs proceedings or for the enforcement of criminal law.
Exceptions to the above rules include:
museums and collectors may be allowed to acquire, possess and dispose of firearms in the category A when they are:
necessary for historical or cultural purposes;
in the context of voluntary military training provided under national law;
for the preservation, restoration or restoration of historical, scientific or technical, technical or heritage objects;
when they are part of a collection or exhibition;
on the basis of a request from a museum or collector.
Ammunition is not covered by the directive unless it has been converted into a semi-automatic firearm by the action of a combustible propellant, and the Commission adopts technical specifications in order to ensure that they cannot be so converted.
Imports and exports of firearms are covered by Directive 2014/36/EU.

Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/852 amending Directives 2009/29/EC and 2014/34/EU on renewable energy and Directive 2014/35/EU.
Directives 2014/36/EU and 2014-35/EC establishing a framework for renewable energy.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVES?
The renewable energy target for 2030 and the EU’s contribution to that target, including their baseline shares in relation to their national overall targets for 2020, are among the elements which have an overarching importance for the EU's energy and environmental policy.
The directive sets binding national targets on the share of renewable energy in energy consumption and in the transport sector to be met by 2020.
It recasts and repeals the 2009 directive.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must:
ensure that renewable energy is included in the calculation methods used to calculate energy consumption* and in energy markets;
make sure that it is not over-subsidised by feed-in tariffs (i.e.g. feedstock tariffs) and that it does not distort the internal energy market;
allow renewable energy producers to participate in cross-border tendering procedures.
In order to support renewable energy projects in the EU, the directive establishes a financial framework aiming to facilitate investments in renewable energy developments in those Member States, including through financial instruments.
Tender procedures
Tenders must be open to all producers of electricity generated from renewable renewable sources on a non-discriminatory basis. To increase the effectiveness of tendering procedure to minimise overall support costs, tenders should, in principle, exclude small-scale installations from tenders opened to them by other Member States.
National support schemes
Member States must ensure that:
they are open to renewable energy installations located on their territory to tenders open to them;
they take into account the participation of those affected by the projects, in particular local populations;
the cost-benefit ratio, in accordance with EU law relating to the electricity market, is calculated according to the overall cost of deploying renewable energy;
there is no preferential treatment of renewable wind power installations compared to other types of energy sources.
Cooperation
The European Commission and the European Atomic Energy Agency (EAA) are responsible for the implementation of the renewable energy directive. The EAA plays a key role in promoting renewable energy development in the European Union (EU).
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE ENTER INTO FORCE?
It entered into force on 1 January 2018.
BACKGROUND
The EU has set binding renewable energy targets for 2030.

Energy labelling of energy-related products (Regulation (EU) 2019/852)
Energy labeling of energy–related products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation No 852/2019/EU on energy labelling
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
It sets out the rules for the labelling and information sheet* of energy* and non-energy* related products in the European Union (EU).
It aims to improve the transparency of the EU’s energy market.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
energy-related electrical and electronic products;
space and water heating products, unless they are imported from a non-EU country;
means of transport for persons or persons travelling by means of public transport.
It does not apply to second-hand products.
Labels and information sheets
EU Member States have the power to adopt delegated acts setting out specific product-specific requirements for energy-specific labelling. These must be adopted by the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission adopts the delegated acts on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
The Commission must publish, in the Official Journal, transitional measurement and calculation methods in relation to the product specific requirements. It must also publish, at least once a year, a list of the products covered by the regulation.
Products covered by delegated acts must bear the following information on the label:
the energy efficiency of the product;
the percentage of products sold that are in the top 2 classes of products in each category
the number of products that fall within the top two classes
the total number of units sold in each class
the average energy consumption of each class of product.
Suppliers must provide a printed label together with each unit of a product. The label must indicate the absolute energy consumption in addition to the label scale, in order to allow customers to predict the direct impact of their choices on their energy bills.
In exceptional cases, where technology is expected to develop more rapidly, no products should fall within these 2 classes at the moment of introduction of the newly rescaled label. However, those products should nonetheless be shown on a label in grey.
A supplier must ensure that products that do not fall into one of these 2 categories are placed on the market and that they comply with the delegated act. The supplier must also provide a product information sheet for each of the 2 categories of products. The information sheet must include:
a description of the energy efficiency* of each category of product and the total energy consumption;
a list of all the products that are covered by this delegated act;
an indicative list of further products for which an energy label could be established.
Disputes between suppliers and the Commission must be settled by the Commission, in cooperation with market surveillance authorities and suppliers, through the implementation of the public and compliance parts of the system on market surveillance.
EU countries have the right to introduce new national schemes for the energy label and the information sheet. They must also maintain or introduce new schemes for these schemes.
If a delegated act is not justified under the EU safeguard procedure, the Commission may adopt a national measure to determine whether it is justified or not and for establishing detailed requirements concerning the operational details concerning the product database.

Protection of personal data in the European Union (EU) — rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data (Regulation (EC) No 596/2004)
Protection in the EU: rules on protecting natural persons
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 550/2004 on data protection
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that all EU citizens have the same level of protection when their data are processed.
It sets out the principles of, and rules on protection of, the rights and freedoms of, natural persons.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
the processing of data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity;
processing of data subjects in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in an EU country;
processing of data subject who are in the Union by a non-EU country’s controller or processor.
Rights and freedoms
The protection afforded by this regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence. It does not apply to persons who do not live in the country in which the processing takes place.
Processing must be carried out in accordance with this regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the EU.
Consent must be given by a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of consent, including by an oral statement.
The consent must be accompanied by a written statement. This statement must include a description of the purpose of the processing and the reasons for the processing, as well as the conditions under which it is carried out.
Procedures must be in line with the principles laid down in Articles 8 and 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (the ‘Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFEU).
EU countries must ensure that:
data subjects who are not established in a EU country are subject to this regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects, so as to monitor their behaviour in so far as their behaviour takes place inside the EU;
the protection of the personal data of persons who are outside the EU is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with their protection of their data;
personal data can be transferred to third countries and international organisations without any restrictions, as long as it complies with their data-protection obligations.
Liability of intermediary service providers
Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the liability rules of intermediaries, in particular of the liability requirements of internet service providers, for the purposes of processing personal data. This regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for EU countries to specify its rules, including for processing of special categories of data (‘sensitive data’).
The processing of sensitive data is subject to the same rules as for other types of data, such as those relating to the security of the data and to public security, so that it is within the scope of this regulation.
Implementation of the regulation
The European Commission has adopted implementing acts to implement the regulation. These include:
Implementing Decision (EU), 2016/849/EU on the implementation of Implementing Regulation (EC), No 598/2004, and Implementing Decision 2014/13/EU of the Commission on the application of implementing Decision 2005/11/EC, as amended by Implementing Decisions 2014/14/EU and 2014/15/EU;
Impositioning Decision 2015/852/EU, 2016/922/EU as amended and implementing Implementing Directive 2014/12/EU.

Harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and the house price index (HPI)
Harmonomically-based consumer prices
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 laying down a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices* of consumer price*
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules for developing, producing and disseminating harmonised index* of the harmonised consumer price index*, harmonised price index-CT*, and harmonised household final monetary consumption expenditure* (OHCP)* at EU and national level.
KEY POINTS
The HCP is based on observed prices, which include taxes on products. It is the basis of the European Commission’s macroeconomic imbalance procedure. The HCP-CT and the OOH-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final money consumption expenditure.
The European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) use these indices in their assessment of price stability in the EU.
HICPs and HICPs-CTs are compiled from statistical units as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93.
A ‘Laspeyres-type index’ is defined as:
the price of a product is denoted by p, the price reference period is 0, and the comparison period is t.
An ‘index reference period’ means the period for which the index is set to 100 index points;
a ‘price reference period,’ which is the period to which the average price of all products is set, is set at 0.
National authorities must verify the sources and methods used by EU countries to calculate the indices and should monitor the implementation of the legal framework by Member States.
EU countries must provide Eurostat with all the necessary data, such as transactions, and electronic records of the data they have collected, every 3 years.
Eurostat is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 10 for the amendment of Annex I of the regulation. These implementing acts concern:
sampling and representativity;
collection and treatment of prices;
replacements and quality adjustment;
index compilation;
revisions;
special indices;
treatment of products in specific areas.
In addition, the Commission must:
monitor the compliance of the Member States with the implementing acts;
make recommendations to the European Statistical System Committee on the application of the Regulation;
assess the suitability of the index for integration into the HCP coverage.
By 31 December 2018, Eurostat must prepare a report which shall address whether the harmonisation requirements for the harmonising indices referred to in Article 4 of this regulation have been met.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 1 July 2011.
BACKGROUND
The harmonised EU indices are used in the context of the macroeconomic balance procedure, as established by Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).
For more information, see:
‘The harmonisation of EU indices’ on Eurostat's website.

Anti-dumping: rules for the application of the 1994 Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADAA) and the rules applicable to imports from non-EU countries (Codified Regulation (EU) 2018/852)
Anti-Dumped: rules applicable for imports from third countries (codified Regulation)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION AND THE DECISION?
The regulation codifies and repeals Regulation (Euratom) No 852/94, which had to become law in the EU countries by 1994.
The aim of the regulation is to ensure that the EU’s trade policy is consistent with those of its major trading partners.
It sets out the conditions under which provisional duties may be imposed, including conditions concerning provisional duties.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The legislation applies to imports originating from a market economy third country (non-EU country) to the EU.
A product is considered to be dumped if its export price is less than a comparable price for a comparable product, in the ordinary course of trade, as established for the exporting country.
Expiry procedure
The Commission may initiate an investigation into a product if:
the price of the product is below the normal value of the comparable product in the market economy of the importing country;
the prices are artificially low;
there is significant barter trade, or when there are non-commercial processing arrangements.
Procedure
The investigation may be launched within 60 days of the initiation of the investigation.
the Commission may decide to suspend the investigation if it considers that the investigation is necessary to supplement the findings.
Imports may be subject to registration.
If the Commission considers that a product is being dumped, it may impose provisional duties on the import of the same product.
Dumping may be suspended if the price of a similar product is:
below the average normal value for the like product;
not higher than the average price for the similar product for the same period of time;
is being sold in quantities which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable time.
In the event of a breach or withdrawal of undertakings, the Commission may impose a provisional duty of up to 9 months. The Commission may also decide to impose additional duties on imports.
Approval of provisional measures
Provisional measures may be adopted by the Commission on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. They must be adopted no earlier than 60 days from initiation and no later than 9 months thereafter. They may include:
an adjustment to costs applicable during the investigation period;
an increase in the average costs applicable, under the abovementioned allocation rules, at the end of such a phase, and shall be included at that level, for the period concerned;
a reduction in the weighted average costs referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4.
An advisory procedure must be used for the adoption of the provisional measures given the effects of such measures and their sequential logic in relation to the adoption definitive measures.

Countervailable subsidies: rules for the application of the EU’s anti-subsidy rules
Countervailing subsidies: ways of applying them
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/852 — rules for applying the rules for implementing the EU Anti-Subsidy Agreement
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules governing the application by the European Commission of the rules on countervailable (or ‘subsidies’) subsidies.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EEC) No 552/97.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all imports of goods from non-EU countries into the EU.
A product is considered to be subsidised if it benefits from a ‘countervailable’ subsidy, defined in Articles 3 and 4 of the regulation.
Subsidies may be subject to countervailing measures only if they are specific, as defined in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 4.
The amount of the subsidy must be calculated in terms of the benefit conferred on the recipient which is found to exist during the investigation period for subsidisation. It must not be less than the total value of the total subsidy.
Imports under investigation may be made subject to registration upon importation in order to enable measures to be subsequently applied against such imports.
In addition, the regulation sets out the procedures for the rejection of complaints or the initiation of proceedings.
Procedures for the submission of complaints and the termination of proceedings are laid down by the Commission.
Complaints must be made within 12 months of the beginning of the investigation. They must include:
the name and address of the recipient;
the nature and nature of the beneficiary;
any application fee or other costs necessarily incurred to qualify for, or to obtain, the subsidy;
export taxes, duties or other charges levied on the export of the product to the EU specifically intended to offset the subsidy. The Commission may, where appropriate, refuse to accept a complaint.
If the Commission considers that a complaint has not been properly investigated, it may, under certain conditions, decide to initiate proceedings against the recipient.
Defendants must provide the Commission with all the information necessary to prove that they have not benefited from the subsidy and that they are not liable for any damage caused by it.
Where the Commission finds that the recipient has benefited from a subsidy that is not justified by the facts of the case, it must take appropriate measures. These measures must be effective, proportionate, dissuasive and dissuasive.
EU countries must ensure that the information they provide to the Commission and to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (EEASC) is not used as a basis for the decision-making process in the EU and that it is not disclosed to any third party.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
The decision has applied since 1 July 2017.

Summary 36:
Financial assistance for the COVID-19 outbreak
Financial assistance to the EU countries affected by the outbreak
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — financial assistance to Member States in difficulties or seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their control
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a mechanism for the European Union (EU) to provide financial assistance for Member States experiencing severe economic disturbances caused by an exceptional occurrence.
It aims to provide the affected Member States with sufficient financial means under favourable terms to enable them to deal with the impact of the outbreak on their labour market.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to the following Member States:
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (1).
It does not apply to the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA).
EU financial assistance
Member States may request EU financial assistance under the Instrument (‘financial assistance’) where:
their actual and possibly also planned public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased as of 1 February 2020 due to national measures directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures to address the socio-economic effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the crisis;
their expenditure has been significantly increased in support of their national loans or similar measures, and, where applicable, in support for relevant health-related measures.
The European Commission must assess every 6 months whether the exceptional circumstances causing the severe economic disturbance in Member States still exist and report to the Council. The Council may grant financial assistance if the Council decides to do so.
If the following:
the Member State must provide the European Central Bank of the EU (ECBanca) with a guarantee of up to €1.5 billion;
the European Commission is empowered to borrow on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the Union at the most appropriate time so as to optimise the cost of funding and preserve its reputation as the EU’s issuer in the markets.
In addition to public health impacts with substantial fatal outcomes, COVID‐19 has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic systems of EU countries, caused societal disruptions and increased public expenditure in a growing number of Member States.
Administration of the loans
The Commission must establish the arrangements for the administration of these loans with the ECB. The ECB is responsible for administering the loans. The loans are guaranteed by Member States and are irrevocable, unconditional and on demand, while additional safeguards are in place to enhance the robustness of the system.
Loan amount
The total amount of loans granted to the three Member States representing the largest share of the loan granted shall not exceed 60 per cent of the maximum amount referred to in Article 5.5 of the regulation. The maximum amount for each Member State may not exceed €1 billion. The total amount for the 3 Member States is not less than €2 billion.
Borrowing and lending operations under the regulation
The Regulation sets out prudential rules, including on the possibility of rolling over the borrowings contracted by the EU.
EU countries may not use the loans to finance their national short-term work schemes, as well as, where appropriate, of the relevant measures, that may be financed by the European Health Insurance Fund (EHIF).
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 February 2018.
BACKGROUND
The COVID–19 outbreak was the first outbreak of its kind in the EU since the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2003.
For more information, see:
Short-term working schemes (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Short-time working scheme: a scheme that allows workers to work part-time in order to supplement their income. Similar schemes exist for income replacement for the self-employed.
* Health-related measure: measures to prevent, control or reduce the incidence of communicable diseases.

Summary 37:
Recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) (Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on the recovery and resolution framework for the resolution of Central Counterparties (CPSs)
Recovery & resolution of CCPs (Regulations (EU, Euratom) No 552/2012 and (EU), No 553/2013)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation No 649/2012 — the recovery & resolution framework of Central counterparties
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
 
The regulation establishes a framework to ensure that central counterparty (CCP)* (i.e. the financial institution that acts as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer) is able to recover from financial distress and to maintain the critical functions of a CCP which is failing or likely to fail while winding up the remaining activities through normal insolvency proceedings.
KEY POINTS
The aim of the regulation is to:
ensure that:
CCPs set out measures to recover in the event of financial distress;
the resolution of the CCP’s failure is carried out in accordance with the law of the country in which the CCP is established;
there is a clear separation of responsibilities between the competent authorities and resolution authorities.
EU countries must ensure that competent authorities have adequate tools at their disposal to handle situations involving CCP failures.
The resolution of a failing CCP should be carried out by competent authorities. The resolution authority should be designated as the resolution authority. The authorities should provide appropriate justification for their participation, based on their analysis of the negative impact that the resolution could have on their EU countries, and the resolution authorities’ ability to minimise the cost to taxpayers of a failed CCP.
In EU countries where a CCP is set up, adequate structural arrangements should be put in place to separate the resolution functions from other functions, in particular where the authority responsible for the prudential supervision of credit institutions or investment firms that are CCPs’ members, is designated as a resolution authority, to avoid any conflicts of interest and risk of regulatory forbearance.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMESSAGE APPLYORK ENTER INTO FORCELEBRATION
The Regulation entered into force on 1 July 2012.
BACKGROUND
  KEY TERMS
* Central counterpartie: a central counterpartie is a financial institution which acts as a buyer or seller between two or more counterparties.
* Clearing: the process whereby financial products and services are exchanged between counterparties in order to facilitate the flow of financial products, services and money between financial institutions and their clients.

Funding of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for the period 2014-2020 (Regulation (EU) No 516/2014) (see summary)
Funding for the 2014-2030 period (Council Decision 2014/516/EU)
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Decision (EU, Euratom) 2018/852 establishing the European Fund for asylum, migration and integration
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND THE REGULATION?
The decision establishes the EU’s main funding instrument for asylum and migration at EU level.
The regulation sets out the objectives of the Fund, which is funded by the European Union (EU), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
KEY POINTS
Asylum and migration policy
The Fund supports the efforts of the EU and its Member States to enhance the Member States’ capacity to develop, monitor and evaluate their asylum policies in the light of their obligations under EU law. It also supports measures tailored to the needs of third-country nationals that are generally implemented in the early stages of integration, as well as horizontal measures supporting EU countries’ capacities in the field of integration.
In addition, the Fund supports measures for sustainable return policies, such as measures to facilitate and guarantee safe and dignified return and readmission and sustainable reintegration of returnees, including through the provision of cash or in-kind support.
It also contributes to global resettlement initiatives with a view to help countries in regions to which a large number of persons in need of international protection have been displaced by helping to alleviate the pressure on those countries, and to effectively contribute to global migration initiatives.
Scope
The fund is divided into 3 categories:
the European Asylum and Migration Fund (the ‘Fund’), which is financed by the ESF, the European Return Fund (Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals) and other EU programmes, including those under shared EU programmes such as the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).
The European Integration Fund (EIF) is financed through the European External Action Service (EEAS) and is co-financed by the EU budget.
Strategy
The EIF is the main instrument for the implementation of EU migration policy. It aims to:
improve the capacity of Member States in the area of integration;
ensure compliance with legal migration rules;
facilitate the swift return of irregular migrants;
promote the integration of non-EU nationals in the EU;
contribute to the resettlement and relocation of applicants for international protection and beneficiaries who are granted international protection under the legal framework of the common European asylum system.
Implementation of the EIF
In order to optimise the added value from investments funded wholly or in part through the Union budget, synergies should be sought, in particular, between the Fund and other European Union programmes, notably the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the Erasmus+ and the Common Security and Defence Fund (CSDP).
Strategic objectives
The aim of the fund is to support actions serving internal EU policy on asylum and immigration in line with the objectives set out in the regulation. These include:
improving the capacities of EU countries to develop and monitor their asylum systems;
encouraging cooperation between Member States on migration and border management;
supporting efforts to ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of migration that is grounded on mutual trust, solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility among Member States and EU institutions;
helping to reduce the burden of migration on Member States;
providing support to countries in the region to which large numbers of persons who are displaced by the influx of asylum seekers.
Sustainable return policies
To achieve its objectives, the fund supports measures in third countries to facilitate the return of illegal migrants and to encourage compliance with migration rules, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the immigration systems. The Fund also supports:
effective readmission of illegally staying non-European Union nationals by third countries;
recipients of refugee status who have been returned to their country of origin;
reintegration and resettlement of those who have returned to the territory of a Member State;
the protection of stateless persons in the context of the Schengen area;
transitional measures for the protection of vulnerable persons who have left their country and who are in danger of being displaced.

Protecting the EU’s financial interests: fraud against the common budget
Protection of the EU's financial interests
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 98/8/EC on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (Financial Instruments Directive)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to protect the European Union (EU) financial interests against fraud.
It establishes minimum rules relating to the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of fraud affecting the EU financial interests.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to:
fraud affecting EU revenue, expenditure and assets at the expense of the general budget (the ‘EU budget’), including financial operations such as borrowing and lending activities.
The definition of fraud falls within the scope of this directive, which should cover fraudulent conduct with respect to revenues, expenditure or assets at:
the general budget;
the EU budget of the Member States;
financial operations that are financed by the EU budget.
Penalties
EU countries must ensure that the imposition of criminal sanctions for criminal offences in accordance with this directive and of administrative measures and penalties does not lead to a breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the principles of justice.
Sanctions
The Directive does not oblige Member States to provide for sanctions of imprisonment for the commission of offences that are not of a serious nature, in cases where intent is presumed under national law. However, Member States must provide for certain types and levels of sanctions when the criminal offences are committed. The maximum sentences should be at least 5 years from the time when the offence was committed.
Limitation periods
Member States should lay down rules concerning limitation periods necessary in order to enable them to counter illegal activities at the cost of the Union's financial interest.
Proper implementation of the Directive by Member States includes the processing of personal data by the competent national authorities, and the exchange of such data between Member States on the one hand, and between competent EU bodies on the other.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
The legislation entered into force on 26 July 1998 and had to become law in Member States by 26 July 1999.
BACKGROUND
  
The Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the Protection of European Communities’ financial interests of 26 July 1995 (3), including the Protocols thereto of 27 September 1996 (4), of 29 November 1996 and of 19 June 1997 (6).

Summary 45:
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 on the harmonisation of interchange fees for card-based payments (Delegating Regulation (EC) No 552/2012) (OJ L 347, 29.10.2012, pp. 1-8)
Delegation (EU, Euratom) No 550/2012 laying down the rules for the implementation of Delegated Regulations (EU and Euratom).
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
   
 
The regulation aims to harmonise the interchange fees* charged by payment card issuers and payment service providers for the use of debit cards.
The aim is to ensure that the fees for debit card transactions are set at an economically efficient level, whilst contributing to fair competition, innovation and market entry of new operators.
KEY POINTS
The interchange fees are charged by the payment card issuer (i.e. the bank issuing the card) and the payment service provider (the acquirer).
The issuer makes payment cards available to the payer, authorises transactions at terminals or their equivalent and may guarantee payment to the acquirer for transactions that are in conformity with the rules of the relevant scheme.
Payment service providers are the banks’ authorised acquirers. The regulation defines the terms ‘acquirer’, ‘bank’ and ‘intermediaries’.
Intermediaries providing part of the acquiring services but without direct contractual relationship with payees should nevertheless be covered in the definition of acquirer under this regulation.
In order to define the relevant interchange fee caps for domestic and cross-border transactions, it is appropriate to allow national competent authorities to collect information regarding the volume and value of all transactions within a payment card scheme or of the transactions pertaining to one or more payment card service providers. The authorities may require that the information sent by these entities is certified by an independent auditor.
It is also necessary to define a maximum share of domestic ‘universal cards’ payment transactions which are considered as being equivalent to credit card transactions. This is based on the number of merchants in each EU country.
FROM WHEN DO THE LEGISLATIONS APPLY?
Directive 2012/260/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2012 laying down rules on interchange fees and on the prohibition of territorial licensing for payment card schemes.
Directives 2012/280/EU and 2012/290/EU have applied since 1 January 2013.
Regulation 2013/30/EU has applied since 31 December 2014.

Summary 49:
Harmonisation of the visa requirements and the exemption from the visa requirement for non-EU nationals
Harmonomisation of:
visa requirements
exemption from visa requirements
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 on the common policy on visas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to harmonise the conditions for entry and transit of non-European Union (EU) nationals by EU countries’ external borders.
It does so by establishing a list of the countries whose nationals are subject to a requirement to be in possession of a visa for the crossing of EU countries' external borders (also referred to herein as ‘the visa requirement’) and those who are exempt from that requirement.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must notify the European Commission and the other EU countries of the measures they take to ensure that the visa regime is administered openly and that the persons concerned are informed.
Nationals of the EU countries listed in Annex II of the regulation must be exempt from the requirement set out in Article 3(1) for stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period.
Non-EU countries are excluded from the list if:
they are not a candidate for membership of the Schengen area;
they do not hold the nationality of any EU country; or
they have not signed an agreement with an EU country on the free movement of persons.
The regulation does not apply to:
stateless persons and other persons who do not have nationality;
non-EU citizens who are not citizens of an EU Member State.
Exemptions from visa requirement
A Member State may exempt a number of categories of persons from a visa requirement, depending on the specific circumstances notified by one or several Member States or reported by the Commission, in accordance with public international law or custom. It may also suspend the exemption if there is a decrease in cooperation on readmission as well as a substantial increase in risks to the public policy or internal security of Member States. The suspension mechanism can be triggered by short reference periods and deadlines, allowing for a fast procedure, and the possible grounds of suspension include:
a deterioration in the security situation of the Member State concerned;
an increase in the risk of terrorism;
a decrease in the level of trust between the Member States concerned.
A temporary suspension of the exemption may also be triggered in the event of a deterioration of the security of the State concerned. The implementing act must determine the categories of nationals to which the suspension should apply, taking into account:
the number of nationals covered by the regulation;
the nature and duration of the temporary suspension; and
the reasons for suspending the exemption.
In addition, the Commission may decide to suspend the visa exemption for a limited period of time, in particular where a readmission agreement has been concluded between the third country concerned and the EU.
Member States must communicate to the Commission and to the other Member States the measures which they take pursuant to this regulation. They must also inform the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee of all the measures that they have taken to implement the regulation.
If a Member State considers that a third country has not complied with its obligations under this regulation, it must inform the Commission of the reasons for its decision. The Commission may also decide to invoke the suspension mechanism in the case of a failure to cooperate with readmission.
Visa requirements
The Member States must:
ensure that:
all nationals of the country concerned are free of any visa requirement during their stay;
visas are issued in a language easily understood by the general public;
travel documents are issued for the same duration as those of the non-member country concerned, except for travel documents issued by the State of origin of the person concerned. In addition, Member States may issue travel documents for the purpose of verifying the validity of the travel document issued for a period of 90 days.
Visas must be issued in the form of a travel document and must be accompanied by a visa. The Member State issuing the visa must also provide the Commission with all the necessary information, such as the date and time of entry and exit, for the persons subject to the visa.
Authorisation of travel documents
The implementing act sets out the number of visas to be issued for each Member State during the period of stay. The number of valid visas must not exceed 5,000.
Each Member State must ensure that all the nationals of its territory are entitled to a visa under the same conditions as nationals of any other Member State, and that all visas are issued within the same period of validity.
Annex II to the regulation provides for the implementation of the reciprocal visa system between Member States and non-Member States.

Eurojust — rules of procedure and operational data protection — Eurojust
Eurojust – rules and procedure
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 — rules and procedures of the European External Action Service (Eurojust)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out Eurojust’s legal framework.
It aims to ensure that Eurojust complies with the principles applicable to EU agencies and fully respects fundamental rights and freedoms, while maintaining its independence in the exercise of its operational functions.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all cases falling under the competence of Eurojust that directly involve at least three EU countries and for which requests or decisions on judicial cooperation have been transmitted to at least two EU countries. It does not apply to investigations involving only one EU country but which have repercussions at EU level.
EU countries must inform Eurojust without undue delay of cases falling within its competence.
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Police and Criminal Investigation Office (EPPO) are responsible for investigating and prosecuting frauds affecting the financial interests of the EU and Eurojust is responsible for assisting them in this area.
In addition, Eurojust may take a more proactive role in coordinating cases, such as by supporting the national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions. It may also assist with investigations involving EU countries that might not initially have been included in the case and discovering links between cases based on the information it receives from Europol, the European anti-fraud office (Europol), OLAF, the EPPOJHA and national authorities.
Cooperation between Eurojust and other EU agencies
It may also be requested by the European Commission or the European Union Agency for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and combating terrorism.
Duties and powers of the Directorate-General for the Protection of the Internal Market (EDPS)
The EDPS has the power to order Eurojust to carry out rectification, restriction, restriction of processing or erasure of operational personal data which have been processed in breach of the data protection provisions contained in national case files. The EDPS must be granted powers allowing him or her to fulfil this duty effectively.
A President and two Vice-Presidents are elected by the College from among the national members for a term of office of four years. When a national member is elected President, the Member State concerned is able to second another suitably qualified person to the national desk and to apply for compensation from Eurojust's budget. The College is also responsible for providing strategic guidance to the Executive Board. The Commission is also its representative on the executive board, to ensure non-operational supervision of the body and to provide it with strategic guidance.
Rights and freedoms
The rules and obligations of the EDPS are set out in the regulation. These include:
the protection of personal data;
the right to access and to have access to operational data for archiving purposes in the public interest or statistical purposes;
protection of the confidentiality of operational data in the event of breaches of data protection rules;
data protection rules on admissibility as evidence in criminal pre-trial and court proceedings;
rules on contractual and non-contractual liability applicable to European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.
Transfers of operational operational data to third countries and international organisations
Personal data can be transferred by Eurojust only if necessary for preventing and combating crime that falls within its tasks. It must be transferred to a third country or to an international organisation only if:
it falls within the scope of its tasks;
it is necessary to prevent and combat crime in a way that is proportionate to the nature of the crime;
there is no need for the transfer to be carried out under the same conditions as that of a national police or judicial authority.
Data protection rules are laid down in the annex to the regulation, including:
data security;
privacy of data; and
the rights of the subjects of data transfers.

Summary 51:
Money laundering: criminal law
money laundering: financial crime
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2017/1371 — criminal law against money laundering
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to combat money laundering by means of criminal law, enabling more efficient and swifter cross-border cooperation between EU countries’ authorities.
KEY POINTS
The directive applies to all criminal activities which constitute predicate offences for money laundering. It does not apply to money laundering as regards property derived from criminal offences affecting the EU’s financial interests, which is subject to specific rules laid down in Directive (EU’1371.
The definition of criminal activities is based on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations and instruments of other international organisations and bodies active in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
EU countries must ensure that certain types of money laundering activities are also punishable when committed by the perpetrator of the criminal activity that generated the property (‘self-laundering’).
Prosecutions are not impeded by the fact that a criminal activity was committed in another EU country or in a non-EU country, subject to the conditions set out in this directive.
To ensure the successful investigation and prosecution of these offences, those responsible for investigating or prosecuting such offences should have the possibility to make use of effective investigative tools such as those which are used in combating organised crime or other serious crimes.
In addition, EU countries must take the necessary measures to ensure the confiscation of property deriving from activities of a criminal nature, including in the absence of a conviction of a specific person or persons for those activities.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
 
   х ъ  
It applies from 1 January 2017.
BACKGROUND
The EU is a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism.
For more information, see:
‘Money laundering’ on the European Commission's website.
* KEY TERMS
* Money laundering: the laundering of funds, instrumentalities and proceeds of crime to facilitate the transfer of funds between criminal organisations or individuals.
Penalty: a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 5 years for a first-time offender. The maximum term may be increased to 10 years for second-time offenders.

Shipbuilding injurious pricing: combating ship-purchase transactions (IPI Code)
Shipbuilding injurious pricing
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2015/755 — combating shipbuilding injuriously priced vessel sales
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to protect the EU’s shipbuilding industry against the sale of ships below their normal value.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EEC) No 182/2011, which had previously codified the Shipbuilding Injurious Pricing Code.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to ships from non-market-economy countries and, in particular, those to which the European Parliament and of the Council have concluded a Shipbuilding Agreement with non-EU countries.
The normal value of a ship is calculated on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits. It does not include actual costs which the shipbuilder demonstrates are due to force majeure and are significantly above the cost increase which the company could reasonably have anticipated and taken into account when the material terms of sales were fixed.
In addition, the normal value does not take into account:
the cost of the vessel itself;
the costs related to its construction, including taxes and import duties; and
the profit of the ship builder.
A vessel is to be considered as being ‘injurious priced’ if the export price of a vessel sold is less than a comparable price for a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, when sold to a buyer of the exporting country.
a person or company controls a buyer when the buyer is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the buyer, which is presumed at a 25% interest.
To maintain the balance of rights and obligations which the agreement establishes, action should be taken by the EU against any shipbuilder whose sale at less than normal value causes injury to the EU industry.
Where appropriate, an investigation may also be initiated upon a written complaint by the authorities of a contracting party to the agreement, in accordance with this regulation and under the conditions of the agreement.
Complaints
The Commission must take all necessary steps to ascertain, in large conglomerates and holdings of third countries, the validity of accounting charges when the cost price structure needs to be estimated. It must also take all the necessary measures to ensure that such charges are paid within the applicable time limit.
If a shipbuilder does not pay the charge within the time limit, it must inform the European Commission of the reasons for its decision. The Commission may take countermeasures if this does not happen.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATIONS APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2015.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a number of implementing acts to combat shipbuilding piracy. These include:
Implementing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 552/2014 on the protection of shipowners and ship-owners against ship-building piracy (see summary);
Directive 2014/34/EU on the prevention, control and enforcement of piracy and on the enforcement of anti-dumping measures in the field of maritime transport.
Directives 2014/35/EU and 2014/36/EU have been amended several times, most recently by Directive 2014/33/EU.

Summary 54:
Cableway subsystems and safety components — EU declaration of conformity
Cableshields and cableway safety components: EU declaration thereof
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on the declaration of CE conformity for subsystems of cableway installations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure the functioning of the EU’s internal market for subsystem* and safety* components for cableways.
It sets out the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedures for the design, manufacture and placing on the market of subsystems* and components*.
It does not apply to:
cable-operated ferries;
lifts, including cable-operated lifts, permanently serving specific levels of buildings and constructions and not operating between cableway stations.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies in its entirety to new cableways, to modifications of existing installations requiring a new authorisation and to installations which are new to the EU market when they are placed on it; that is to say, they are either new subsystems or safety components made by a manufacturer established in the EU or subsystems, whether new or second-hand, imported from a non-EU country.
The scope of the regulation does not include:
construction and maintenance of cableways;
the inspection of installations prior to their entry into service;
monitoring of installations during operation.
Implementing Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 lays down the rules for the authorisation of planned cableways and for the monitoring of installations before they are put into service.
Authorisation procedures
EU countries have to specify adequate procedures for authorising the construction, maintenance and operation of new and existing cableways as well as for monitoring installations during their operation. These procedures must be consistent with those laid down in Directive 2000/9/EC on the harmonisation of technical harmonisation and standards (see summary).
EU notification of conformity assessment bodies
EU notified bodies must notify the European Commission of the results of the conformity assessment carried out by them. The notification must be sent to the Commission within 3 months of the notification of the competent national authority. The Commission must then inform the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of its decision to adopt the regulation.
EU declaration of safety components
EU declarations of conformity must be available in a single EU declaration. This declaration is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense.
Manufacturers, importers and distributors must ensure that their products are in conformity with the regulation and that they only make available those which are in compliance with this regulation. They must also ensure that:
all their products bear the CE marking and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent authorities;
they keep the information required under this regulation for the identification of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a subsystem or safety component or to whom they have supplied a subsystem and a safety component.
In the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies do not create unnecessary burdens for economic operators.

The European social fund (EaSI)
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2021/1060 establishing the European Social Facility
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND THE ESF?
The decision establishes the European social funds (ESFs).
The ESF+ is the European Union’s main instrument for tackling poverty and social exclusion. It aims to contribute to the eradication of poverty by supporting national schemes aiming to alleviate food and material deprivation and promote social integration of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the most deprived persons.
It also aims to improve the functioning of labour markets by supporting the modernisation of labour market institutions such as the public employment services, in order to improve their capacity to provide intensified targeted counselling and guidance during the job search and the transition to employment and to enhance the mobility of workers.
KEY POINTS
The EaSI strand is based on three pillars:
equal opportunities and access to the labour market;
fair working conditions;
social protection and inclusion.
The 20 key principles of the Pillar are structured in three categories: equal opportunities, access to labour market, fair working conditions and social protection; andinclusion.
To achieve its objectives, the ESF aims to:
facilitate reskilling and upskilling and employability, career transitions, geographic and sectoral mobility and supporting in particular low-skilled people, persons, persons with disabilities and poorly qualified adults;
promote self-employment and the social economy;
encourage the participation of the most at all levels of society;
support the social inclusion of disadvantaged groups;
improve the quality of education, training and lifelong learning;
ensure a gender balanced labour market.
In order to achieve the objectives of the EASI strand, the European Commission has adopted a number of recommendations, including:
Recommendation of 15 March 2018 on a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships, lifelong guidance, skills anticipation in close cooperation with industry, up-to-date training materials and delivery methods, forecasting and graduate tracking, training of educators, validation of learning outcomes and recognition of qualifications and industry-based certifications;
Council Recommendation of 22 November 2016 on the European Semester for economic policy coordination (the ‘European Semester’) and on the ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future’ as a first step in mainstreaming the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all EU policies, including through its financing instruments.
EU countries are required to identify and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by EU or national funding. The Commission may reimburse EU countries using simplified cost options including lump sums and grants.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European General Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European general fund to help displaced workers who have lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation.
It is part of the EU’s multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2021–2027.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The EGF is a flexible and special instrument outside the budgetary ceilings of the MFF, as set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘A Modern Budget for a Union that Protects, Empowers and Defends The Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2020’ of 2 May 2018 and the annex thereto. It is funded by the European Social Fund (ESF+) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Beneficiaries of the EGF are:
displaced workers and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased or whose employment contract or relationship has ceased;
persons who have been affected by a major restructuring event that has a significant impact on the local or regional economy;
people who have left the labour market due to the impact of the restructuring event.
The regulation sets out the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries.
EU countries must ensure that:
the EGF beneficiaries are provided with equal access to the fund, irrespective of their type of employment contract, relationship or relationship;
they have access to financial support;
the fund is open to all EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation;
beneficiaries receive equal access, without discrimination, to the same level of assistance as other EU citizens;
all beneficiaries are covered by the same eligibility criteria as other beneficiaries of the ESF and the ERDF.
Eligibility criteria
The European Commission publishes a list of eligible beneficiaries. The list is updated every 2 years. The Commission publishes the list of beneficiaries in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/2023/EU.
In addition, the Commission publishes an annual report on the implementation of EGF rules and measures taken by EU countries. It also publishes a summary of the number of beneficiaries and the results of the financial transfers made to beneficiaries in each year, as well as a breakdown of the beneficiaries’ contributions.
Funding
In order to support beneficiaries effectively and rapidly, EU countries must do their utmost to submit complete applications when applying for a financial contribution from the fund. They must also submit a detailed background analysis of the event that triggered the financial contribution, which must be made available to the Commission and to the public. In addition, they must provide the Commission with a detailed description of the reasons for the redundancies where relevant and anticipate future labour market perspectives and required skills.
Displaced workers must be provided with adequate information on their rights and obligations, including:
their rights and responsibilities;
their access to employment contracts, employment contracts and employment relationships;
a description of their rights, obligations and obligations under the employment contract and employment relationship, including their rights under the social security system;
access to social protection, including the right to a pension and the right of participation in the pension system.
To ensure that beneficiaries are not excluded from receiving financial support, the European Commission adopts a number of measures, such as:
measures to increase the representation of the less represented gender, thus contributing towards the reduction of the gender pay gap and the pension gap;
measures aimed at improving the participation of women in the decision-making process;
means to improve the inclusion of women and men in the selection and selection of beneficiaries, including by:

Budgetary discipline and cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission: the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 (CFSP 2021-2020) (Agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters and sound financial management)
Budgets and budgetary discipline
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2020/2021/CFSP — Interinstitutional Agreement on the implementation of budgetary discipline between the EU institutions and the Commission on budgetary matters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to improve the functioning of the EU’s annual budgetary procedure and cooperate between the institutions on budgetary issues as well as the Commission and the Council.
The decision adopts the agreement on behalf of the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
The financial framework (MFF) 2021–2027 is the framework for the EU budget. It covers the period from 2021 to 2027. The agreement replaces the agreement of 2 December 2013, which entered into force on 16 December 2013.
In the framework of the MFF, the agreement covers all expenditure. The total amount of CFSP operating expenditure is divided between the articles of the CFSP budget chapter as suggested in the third paragraph of the agreement. The Commission will examine how to develop a methodology to measure the relevant expenditure at programme level. This methodology will be transparent, comprehensive, result-oriented and performance-based, and will identify relevant measures to be taken in case of insufficient progress towards achieving applicable targets. It will include annual consultation by the Commission, the Commission of the Parliament and of the Council in order to identify the necessary measures to achieve the relevant targets.
CFSP actions are divided into the following categories:
single major missions;
other missions (for crisis management operations, conflict prevention, resolution and stabilisation, and monitoring and implementation of peace and security processes);
non-proliferation and disarmament;
emergency measures;
preparatory and follow-up measures; and
European Union Special Representatives.
Each year the Commission will update the forecasts for payment appropriations for the period at least until 2027 at least every 3 years.
If appropriations relating to fisheries agreements, including the reserve, prove insufficient, it must provide the European parliament and the council with the necessary information on the causes of the situation and on measures which might be adopted under established procedures.
Where the conditions for mobilising the Brexit Adjustment Reserve set out in the relevant instrument are met, it will submit a proposal to the European European Parliament and to the Council for a transfer from that reserve to the relevant budget lines in accordance with the Financial Regulation.
When a proposal for a new MFF or for a substantial revision has been presented, the Institutions will seek to determine specific arrangements for cooperation and dialogue between them throughout the procedure leading to its adoption.

Members are elected for a term of 5 years. The term of office of an outgoing Member of Parliament ends on the date communicated by the competent authorities of an EU Member State.
The president of the Council of Europe is responsible for verifying the credentials of individual Members who are replacing outgoing Members and may at any time rule on any dispute as to the validity of the mandate of any of its Members.
When a Member resigns, the President must inform the committee responsible of the date on which that resignation is to take effect, which may not be more than 3 months after notification. If the committee considers that the resignation is in compliance with the act, a vacancy is declared with effect from the date indicated by the resigning Member in the official record, and the President informs Parliament thereof.
In the event of a dispute between the President and the Committee responsible, the president may, without delay, rule on the validity or validity of any Member’s mandate. The committee may also adopt a proposal for the committee to verify the membership of individual members who are replaced.
All Members have the right to participate actively in the work of Parliament's committees and delegations in accordance with the provisions of these rules. Access to confidential information is subject to the rules laid down in interinstitutional agreements concluded by Parliament relating to the treatment of confidential information.
Exemptions from parliamentary duties
Members have immunity from all parliamentary duties. They are not obliged to give evidence in the course of their parliamentary duties, except in cases where it would be difficult for them to do so. They may, however, invoke their immunity if they consider that they have been informed in writing that they will not be able to comply with their duties or that they are not confident that they do not fulfil their duties, or if they have not been informed of the reasons for their immunity.

Recovery and Resilience Facility 2021-2027 — own resources (recovery and resiliency measures)
Recovery & Resiliency Facility 2021–2027: own resources
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU, Euratom) 2021/2027 establishing a new system of own resources based on value added tax (VAT)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It establishes the EU’s own resources* for the period 2021-2020.
It aims to ensure that the EU has sufficient financial capacity in the event of an economic crisis.
KEY POINTS
The decision establishes a new category of own resource based on national contributions calculated on the basis of non-recycled plastic packaging waste.
The new own resources are:
—
the VAT base of 3.8 kilograms multiplied by the population in 2017 of the EU countries concerned. This is equal to 3.4 % of the gross national income (GNI) of each EU country, i.e. the value of all taxable supplies divided by the weighted average VAT rate calculated for the relevant calendar year as stipulated in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1553/89 (see summary);
— and
the weight of the weight of all non-precious metals in the EU.
VAT base of 1.8 kg of the VAT base for each country. This corresponds to 3,8 kg multiplied by 3.3.8 % of GNI.
This will be increased to 1.40 % of EU countries’ GNIs by 2021. This will allow the European Commission to borrow up to €142 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF. This amount will be used to finance the recovery and resilience measures of the COVID-19 crisis. The amount will not exceed 1.3 % of all EU countries' GNIs.
In addition, the decision sets out the rules for the early repayment of loans from the ERDF.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The Decision applies from 1 January 2021.
BACKGROUND
   
The COVID–19 crisis was the first major crisis to hit the EU since the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in the early 1980s. Since then, the ERF has been used to help the EU cope with economic and financial difficulties.

Fishing opportunities for European eel in the EU waters of the International Commission for the Regulation on the Law of the Sea (ICES) 2020/973 and Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the management of fish stocks and fishery opportunities in the European Union (EU waters of ICES) [See amending acts].
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the fishing opportunities available to EU fishing vessels for certain species of fish in the International Council of the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
European eel
European seabass
Horse mackerel
European shark
Atlantic blue sharks.
It does not apply to certain fish stocks, such as:
fishing opportunities* for European sharks,
bycatch* for by-catch* in mixed fisheries.
The fishing opportunities are based on scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and other advisory bodies, as well as any advice received from specific advisory councils.
EU Member States are responsible for determining the level of fishing opportunities for each fish stock or fishery.
Where a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member State only, it is up to that Member State to determine the level.
If a Member State has no quota to cover their unavoidable by-catches, the Member State is responsible for the allocation of the TAC.
In addition, Member States must ensure that:
the number of fishing vessels participating in a mixed fishery does not exceed the number of vessels;
the total number of fish caught in a given year is not exceeded by more than the maximum sustainable yield (MSY);
there is no obligation to land all catches from those stocks, as this would lead to the phenomenon of ‘choke species’.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
The regulations apply from 1 August 2020 and 28 February 2021.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a multiannual plan for the EU’s western waters.
For more information, see:
Fishing Opportunities in the Western Waters (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* By-catch: fish caught during the fishing closure period, i.e. the period during which the fishing vessels are not allowed to fish.

EU macro-financial assistance to Ukraine
EU macro–financial assistance
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2018/1046 — EU’s macro‐financial assistance for Ukraine
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It authorises the EU to provide a maximum amount of €1.2 billion of economic and financial assistance to the Ukrainian authorities in order to support the economic stabilisation and substantive reform agenda of the country.
KEY POINTS
The decision provides for the European Union to make macro-financing of a maximum €1,2 billion available to Ukraine, with a view to supporting Ukraine to:
strengthen the economic resilience of the Ukrainian economy;
accompany Ukraine in its efforts to implement structural reforms;
support the structural reform agenda, supplementing resources made available under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) financial arrangement.
The assistance is subject to economic policy conditions, to be set out in a memorandum of understanding (MOU). The European Commission is empowered to negotiate these conditions with Ukraine under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the EU countries.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The financial assistance will be available from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022.
BACKGROUND
In spring 2014, Ukraine embarked on an ambitious reform programme with the aim of stabilising its economy and improving the livelihoods of its citizens. The programme was suspended when the country was unable to access the international capital markets. The continuous build-up of uncertainty has resulted in a recent loss of confidence, negatively affecting the economic outlook and, since mid-January 2022, in the economic prospects.

Mediterranean swordfish: management and control measures
MEDIUM FRAMEWORK FISHING REGULATION
Mediterranean swords fishing: management measures
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 — management measures and controls for Mediterranean swordfish
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
   
The regulation aims to ensure that the European Union (EU), as a whole, is able to achieve a biomass of swordfish corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2031, with at least a 60 % probability of achieving that objective.
It repeals Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.
KEY POINTS
The EU is party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (‘the ICCAT Convention’). To that end, including avoiding the collapse of the stock, and after analysing the scientific advice of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), ICCAT adopted Recommendation 16-05 establishing a multiannual recovery plan for the stock.
The Regulation applies to the allocation of quotas for the years 2018 and 2019.
EU countries must use transparent and objective criteria, including those of an environmental, social and economic nature, when allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, and shall also endeavour to distribute national quotas fairly among the various fleet segments, giving consideration to traditional and artisanal fishing, and to provide incentives to EU fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact.
Fishing effort
EU vessels must:
fishing in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU countries’ annual fishing plans;
make provision for bycatch within their quota and inform the Commission thereof when transmitting its annual fishing plan to the European Commission;
ensure that vessels that exceed their allocated quota or their maximum level of permitted by-catches are not allowed to continue to fish;
keep a record of all swordfish caught and processed in the EU;
notify the Commission by 1 March of each year the measures taken to limit the number of fishing vessels flying EU flag and authorised flag and flying the flag of EU countries flying the EU flag.
FROM WHEN DO THESE REGULATES APPLY?
The regulations entered into force on 1 January 2017.

Better law-making in the EU: Common Understanding between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission
Better law making in the European Union: Common Agreement with the EU institutions
SUMMARY OF:
Joint Political Declaration of 27 October 2011 on the improvement of the quality of EU legislation
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND THE AGREEMENT?
The joint political declaration establishes a framework for cooperation between the three European Union (EU) institutions:
the European Parliament and the Council,
the Council of Europe, and
the Commission.
The aim of the joint declaration is to improve the quality and efficiency of the EU’s legislation, while avoiding overregulation and administrative burdens.
KEY POINTS
The three institutions agree that the analysis of the potential ‘European added value’ of any proposed EU action, as well as an assessment of the ‘cost of non-Europe’ in the absence of action at EU level, should be fully taken into account when setting the legislative agenda.
In order to achieve this, the three institutions commit to:
public and stakeholder consultations;
impact assessments;
ex-post evaluations;
reporting, monitoring and evaluation requirements in legislation;
transparency and accountability.
To achieve these objectives, they commit to, as appropriate, establish reporting, monitoring, evaluation requirements and transparency requirements in EU legislation, in particular on Member States.
They also commit to ensuring that the Commission adopts a proposal for a delegated or implementing act within the limits of the Treaties.
Public consultations
The Commission will, before adopting a proposal, conduct public consultations in an open and transparent way, ensuring the modalities and time-limits of those public consultations allow for the widest possible participation. Where the Commission decides not to submit a proposal in response to such a request, it will inform the institution concerned of the detailed reasons, and will provide, where appropriate, an analysis of possible alternatives and respond to any issues raised by the co-legislators in relation to analyses concerning 'European value' and concerning the "cost ofnon-Europe". The Commission will also explain in its explanatory memoranda how the measures proposed are justified in the light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and how they are compatible with fundamental rights.
Ex-post evaluation
The European Parliament will, when they consider this to be appropriate and necessary for the legislative process, carry out impact assessments.
Each institution will inform each other in good time before adopting or revising their guidelines concerning their tools for Better Law-Making (public consultations, impact assessments and ex-post assessments).
In addition, the Commission will:
inform the other institutions of its plans and priorities for the new term of the Commission;
share views on the principal policy objectives and priorities of the three Institutions;
participate in debates on the implementation of the Joint declaration in the Parliament and/or the Council during the spring of the year in question.
FROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?
   
The agreement entered into force on 1 January 2012.
BACKGROUND
The EU is the world's largest economy and has the largest number of citizens. It is also the largest single market in the world, with a population of over 1.3 billion.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 529/2004 on plant protection products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
It sets out the rules for the authorisation of plant protection* products.
It aims to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment.

The regulation applies to substances, including micro-organisms having general or specific action against harmful organisms on plants, which are classified as ‘plant protection products’. It does not apply to substances which are not used for plant protection, but which may be of value for such purposes.
EU countries must apply the precautionary principle when granting authorisations to plants. This principle states that substances or products produced or placed on the market do not have any harmful effect on human or animal health or any unacceptable effects on the environment, and that they do not pose a risk to the health or safety of plants or animals.
Authorisations are granted by EU countries on the basis of harmonised criteria. They are valid for a period of 5 years and may be extended after 5 years if necessary.
In addition to active substances, the regulation sets out rules on:
the authorisation procedure for minor uses;
the control and inspection arrangements with regard to the marketing and use of plants protection products;
compliance with feed and food law, animal health, animal welfare and animal welfare rules, including record-keeping;
control measures for the use of the products at all stages of the production of food;
authorisation procedures for the manufacture, importation and export of plants.
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the regulation. It is assisted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMSA).
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
It has applied since 1 January 2005.
BACKGROUND
 
  The regulation is part of the EU’s Plant Protection Directive 91/414/EEC (see summary).

Unitary patent protection: European patent with unitary effect (Regulation 2011/167/EU)
Unitary Patent protection: EU unitary patent protection (Council Regulation (EU) 2021/2021)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1169/2011 on the creation of unitary patents
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that patents granted in the European Patent Office (EPO) have the same set of claims in all EU countries.
It sets out the rules for granting and renewing patents.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to patents granted by the EPO to:
patents that are registered in the Register for unitary Patent Protection in EU countries;
patent applications that have been submitted by the European patent applicant in the EU countries and which have been registered in that register;
pending patent applications which have not yet been granted.
EU countries must ensure that the patent is deemed not to have taken effect on their territory as a national patent, so as to avoid any duplication of patent protection.
The EPO publishes the list of EU countries that have granted a patent with a unitary protection in its European Patent Bulletin.
A patent granted with the same sets of claims is granted in all the participating EU countries, provided that it has been registered and that its unitary effects have been recognised in the register.
Patent proprietors must pay a single annual renewal fee for a European patent. The renewal fee is progressive throughout the patent protection and, together with the fees to be paid by the patent applicant during the pre-grant stage. The EPO covers all the costs associated with the grant of the patent and the administration of the protection. The fee may be reduced if the patent has been granted in a country with a disproportionately low level of patenting activity and/or having acquired membership of the European Intellectual Property Organisation relatively recently.
Compulsory licences for European patents with unitARY effect are governed by the national laws of the participating countries as regards their respective territories.

Summary 99:
The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AFMIF)
The asylum, Migration & Integration Fund
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/852 establishing the Asylum, Migratory and Integration fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the EU’s first asylum, migration and integration fund.
It aims to contribute to the development of the common EU policy on asylum and immigration and to the strengthening of the area of freedom, security and justice in the light of the application of the principles of solidarity and responsibility-sharing between the EU countries and cooperation with non-EU countries.
KEY POINTS
The fund supports the efforts by the EU and the Member States relating to the enhancement of their asylum policies in light of their obligations under existing EU law. It also supports measures to combat illegal immigration or the circumventing of existing legal migration rules, thereby safeguarding the integrity of EU countries’ immigration systems.
The main objectives of the fund are to:
increase the capacity of Member States to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate their immigration and integration strategies, policies and measures for third-country nationals, including EU legal instruments.
To enhance the solidarity and better share the responsibility between Member States, in particular towards those most affected by asylum flows, the fund also supports the implementation of a Union Resettlement Programme and the transfer of beneficiaries of international protection from one Member State to another.
In addition, the Fund provides financial support for new approaches concerning access to asylum procedures in a safer manner, by targeting main countries of transit such as protection programmes for particular groups or certain procedures for examination of applications for asylum.
Asylum and migration policy
The Fund also contributes to the effective functioning of the Common European Asylum System, which encompasses measures relating to policy, legislation, and capacity-building, while acting in cooperation with other EU countries, EU agencies and third countries. It is also responsible for:
facilitating the return of persons who have been illegally crossing the external borders of the EU;
providing financial support to Member States in the field of border management;
contributing to the establishment of the European Asylum and Migration Agency (EASA);
supporting the creation of a European Asylum Network (EAN).
The EAN is responsible for the coordination of the EASA and the management of the return process. The EAN has the responsibility of:
monitoring and evaluating the asylum and migration situation;
coordinating with other Member States;
ensuring that asylum procedures are implemented in a safe and effective manner;
collecting and analysing data on the number of people who have applied for international protection;
assisting the EAN in its work.
Funding
Part of the available resources under the Fund are to be used for the implementing of specific actions which require cooperative effort amongst Member States and generate significant added value for the Union, as well as for the implementation, under the EU Resettlement programme, of an EU resettlement programme. The Fund also provides financial incentives for Member States’ implementation of this programme.
Member States must ensure that the financial incentives are not disproportionate to the actual costs of implementing the programme. In addition, Member States must take into account the specific needs of the beneficiaries of protection.
Transfer of beneficiaries
The European Commission has adopted a number of implementing measures, including:
a mechanism based on the nationality of the recipients of protection, which allows for the transfer to another Member State of the same number of persons;
a system for the allocation of financial incentives to the countries involved in the resettlement programme;
the establishment of a system for assessing the eligibility of beneficiaries for resettlement.
A number of other implementing measures are also included in the Fund. These include:
assistance for the most vulnerable persons in the European Union;
emergency assistance for those most in need of humanitarian assistance;
measures for the protection of children and women;
reintegration measures for vulnerable persons.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 1 January 2015.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European Union fund to support the work carried out by Member States’ competent authorities in order to combat transnational threats to the Union’s internal security.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The instrument is designed to provide financial support for actions of particular interest to the EU (‘EU actions’), emergency assistance and technical assistance, and for shared management in respect of national programmes and actions requiring administrative flexibility.
It covers:
measures in and in relation to third countries supported through the instrument, both geographic and thematic, with a view to engaging in drug trafficking activities;
measures to combat organised crime, terrorism, organised crime and the financing of terrorism and organised crime financing;
cooperation between judicial authorities and law enforcement authorities.
EU actions
The fund is funded by direct and indirect management. It is managed by the European Commission and the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.
The Commission monitors the implementation of the Instrument, with the aid of key indicators for evaluating results and impacts.
Funding
The EU budget allocated to the Instrument is divided into 3 categories:
1.
Emergency assistance: the EU budget is divided between the EU countries’ national programmes;
2.
3.
emergency assistance: it is split between the European Police and Border and Coast Guard.

Tariff preferences for sustainable development and good governance: general arrangement (GSP)
Tariffs preferences for Sustainable development and Good governance: General arrangement (SDP)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing a general arrangement for the promotion of sustainable development in the field of development cooperation with developing countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a general tariff preferences scheme for developing countries.
It aims to promote the eradication of poverty and to promote sustainable development.
The general arrangement applies to all those developing countries which share a common developing need and are in a similar stage of economic development. It does not apply to countries which are benefiting from a preferential market access arrangement with the EU, which provides at least the same level of tariff preferences as the scheme for substantially all trade.
KEY POINTS
Eligible countries
A list of eligible countries is established in the regulation’s annexes.
Beneficiaries are those countries which:
have a bilateral trade agreement with the European Union (EU);
have an agreement with a non-EU country;
have signed an association agreement with an EU country.
A beneficiary country is eligible for tariff preferences if:
it meets the eligibility criteria for the general arrangement;
it fulfils the conditions laid down in the annexes to the regulation, i.e. it meets the criteria set out in Article 290 TFEU of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU); and
it is in a position to benefit from the additional tariff preferences granted under the special incentive arrangement.
Graduation of a beneficiary country
The graduated tariff preferences are granted when a section of a tariff preference is graduated over 3 consecutive years, in order to increase predictability and fairness of the scheme by eliminating the effect of large and exceptional variations in the import statistics. The beneficiary country may be excluded from the scheme if it does not fulfil the criteria for graduation.
Suspension from the tariff preferences of certain beneficiary countries
The regulation establishes an advisory procedure for the implementation of implementing acts on suspension from certain GSP sections in respect of beneficiary countries and on the initiation of a temporary withdrawal procedure, taking into account the nature and impact of those acts. The regulation also sets out a procedure for repealing a decision on temporary withdrawal under the urgency procedure before that decision to temporarily withdraw tariff preferences takes effect, where the reasons justifying temporary withdrawal no longer apply.
DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
It entered into force on 21 November 2012 for countries which by 20 November 2012 had initiated bilateral trade agreements with the Union.
BACKGROUND
The General arrangement is one of a number of EU policies designed to help developing countries to diversify their economy and to reduce their dependence on the EU.
For more information, see:
‘The General Economic Partnership’ on the European Commission's website.
* KEY TERMS
* General arrangement: a system of preferential trade preferences granted to developing countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1979, under which WTO Members may accord differential and more favourable treatment than developing countries (see summary).
* Special incentive arrangement: an arrangement designed to encourage the sustainable development of developing countries and promote good governance.

KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:

When an EU country considers that an application for an authorisation has not been fulfilled, it must inform the European Commission and the European Parliament. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to carry out the obligations imposed on it by this regulation and by that Common Position.
Imports of the items covered by the regulation must be accompanied by:
a certificate of authorisation issued by the competent EU country;
a declaration of the country of origin of the item;
an export contract between the exporter and the importer.
If no export contract has been concluded or if the holder of the contract does not act on its own behalf, the person who has the power for sending the item out of the customs territory of the EU is responsible for determining the sending of it.
In addition, EU countries must:
ensure that:
the consignments are accompanied by the necessary documents;
the documents contain the necessary information for the authorisation to be granted; and
the authorisation holder has the right to raise any objections it or they may have to the granting of such authorisation.
Export authorisations are valid for up to 5 years and can be renewed up to a maximum of 3 times. The exporter must notify the competent authority of the relevant EU country of the reasons for granting or revoking such authorisations. The competent authority must also inform the Commission of any objections that it may have regarding the granting or revocation of authorisations, and of the measures it may take to deal with such objections.
Where an export is subject to an import or transit measure, the competent authorities must ensure that the relevant documents are:
accompanied by the required information;
transported within the EU by a consignment of goods;
exported to, or through, a third country by means of an authorised consignment.

Summary 106:
Eurodac: access to the European Union’s central database for fingerprint data (2013-2020)
EurodAC: access and sharing of fingerprint data
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 — access to Eurodac for terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules for the access of the designated authorities of the EU countries’ national authorities to the central database, EurodAC, for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating terrorist offences or other serious crimes.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to the following categories of persons:
third-country nationals or stateless persons who have stayed in the EU for several years and have obtained a settled status or even citizenship of an EU country after that period;
non-EU nationals who have been resident in an EU Member State for many years and who have applied for international protection.
It does not apply to non-EU citizens who have not applied for refugee status.
Requests for comparison with data stored in the Central System should be made by the operating units within the designated authority to the national access point, through the national verifying authority.
The designated authority and the verifying authority may not be part of the same organisation, if the requesting authority is part of another organisation.
EU countries must ensure that the competent national authority has the necessary legal basis to verify the validity of the request.
In addition, the competent authority of the country in which the request is made must be able to verify that the requested data is authentic and that it has been entered into the database in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 259/68/68 of the European Parliament and of the Council on matters pertaining to the establishment of the Central Information Infrastructure (the ‘Communication Infrastructure’).
The Commission outlines in its Communication on improved effectiveness, enhanced interoperability and synergies among European databases in the area of Justice and Home Affairs that authorities responsible for internal security could have access to this database in well defined cases, when there is a substantiated suspicion that the perpetrator of a terrorist or serious criminal offence has applied for asylum or has been convicted of a criminal offence in another Member State.
Context
The purpose of the regulation is to improve the access to existing data filing systems in the field of justice and home affairs.
For more information, see:
European Asylum and Migration Agency (European External Action Service).
KEY TERMS
* Latent fingerprint: a fingerprint which is the dactyloscopic trace which may be found at a crime scene.
* Stateless person: a person who has not been granted refugee status in the Member State in which he or she is resident for more than 2 years.

Summary 107:
Protection of designations of origin and traditional specialities guaranteed
Protecting designs of origin
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on the protection of certain designations and geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that the EU’s agricultural product quality policy (APQP) is implemented.
It sets out the rules for protecting designations* of origin* and ‘traditional specialities* guaranteed*’.
KEY POINTS
Protection
Protected designations or geographical indications (DOSs)
The regulation applies to products for which there is an intrinsic link between a product or foodstuff characteristics and geographical origin.
The protection of DOSs is extended to the misuse, imitation and evocation of the registered names on goods as well as on services in order to ensure a high level of protection and to align that protection with that which applies to the wine sector.
Traditional specialities are protected under the same rules as protected designations. The regulation also applies to wine.
To be protected, the protected designation of origin must be indicated on the labelling and it must be possible to associate it with the indication ‘Traditional speciality guaranteed’ (see summary).
The European Union symbol (EU symbol) must be used on the packaging of products bearing the protected DOS. The EU symbol must be accompanied by the protected geographical indication (GGI) on the same packaging.
In addition, the European Commission may adopt guidelines on optional quality terms, such as ‘mountain products’ or ‘tourist products,’, which may give rise to consumer confusion if they are used in combination with a protected designation or GGI. These guidelines should be adopted by the Commission within 3 years of the adoption of the regulation.
National authorities must ensure that:
the registered names are used fairly;
the protection of the protected names is enforced;
producers organised into groups must themselves define the product in a specification.
A register of registered names and GIs is established. The registered names must be included in the register and they are automatically included in a register. The register also includes the names of producers who have been excluded from the register.
Procedures for the registration of protected names
The registered names of origin are examined by the competent authorities of the EU country concerned. The competent authorities may refuse or, if registered, invalidate a trade mark on grounds that it conflicts with a prior designation or geographical indication. They may also refuse to grant transitional protection at national level without affecting intra-EU or international trade.
An application for a protected name must be submitted to the competent authority of an EU country. If the application is refused, the applicant must submit a statement of the reasons for the refusal and the reasons why. This statement must include the name of the producer, the geographical origin of the product and a description of the characteristics of the products concerned.
EU countries may also decide to apply for transitional protection if they consider that the protected name does not comply with the conditions laid down in the regulation or that it is likely to mislead or deceive consumers.
Exemptions
The Commission may exclude from the scope of this regulation certain protected names which have been granted transitional protection under the APQP. These include:
tourists’ names;
traditional products;
wine;
vegetative products.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The Regulation has applied since 1 January 2005.

Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/852 — common rules for the protection of civil aircraft
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes common rules to protect persons and goods within the European Union (EU).
It seeks to improve the level of security in the EU’s aviation sector.
It aims to:
ensure uniform rules are applied to all airports or parts of airports located in the territory of an EU Member State that are not exclusively used for military purposes;
improve the levels of security for passengers and cargo;
reduce the risk of terrorist attacks on civil aircraft.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to the following:
airports or parts thereof located in an EU country;
all operators, including air carriers, providing services at airports referred to in point (a);
all entities applying aviation security standards that operate from premises located inside or outside airport premises and provide goods and/or services to or through airports;
airport security screening and screening procedures.
Airport security search: an inspection of the interior and accessible exterior of the aircraft in order to detect prohibited articles and unlawful interferences that could endanger the safety of the flight.
Security restricted area: an area of airside where, in addition to access being restricted, other security standards are applied.
security restricted area is a restricted area.
In-flight security officers: these are government personnel who are specially selected and trained, taking into account the required security and safety aspects on board an aircraft. They are responsible for the provision of security on board the aircraft and for ensuring the safety and security of the passengers and crew.
EU Member States may decide whether to deploy in flight security officers on aircraft registered in that Member State and on flights of air carriers licensed by it as well as to ensure, in accordance with Article 4.7 of Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and under the terms of that Convention, that such officers are trained in the security aspects of aviation.
The Commission may use the urgency procedure for the adoption of common rules on aviation security.
Member States may designate one or more Member States as the single point of contact with third countries for the implementation of the common basic standards. The Member States must ensure that the security measures adopted by the Member States are equivalent to the common standards and that these measures are monitored by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
The European Commission must monitor the application by Member States of this regulation, and also to make recommendations to improve aviation security, including inspections, including unannounced inspections. The Commission may draw up a report on the application of the regulation and make recommendations on how it should be improved. It may also draw up recommendations to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (Euratom) on measures to be taken to improve civil aviation security and to improve cooperation between Member States.
If Member States consider that the measures adopted under this regulation are not equivalent to those adopted under the common rules, they must inform the Commission and the EASA of this decision. If the Commission considers that Member States have not complied with the requirements of this Regulation, it may adopt a new regulation. If Member States do not comply with the regulation, the Commission may adopt an amendment to the regulation. The regulation may also be amended in the light of the experience gained, and the regulation itself should be repealed and replaced by Regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) No 552/2014.

Cross-Border movements of money
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 on the movement of cash in the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to prevent and deter the circumvention of the obligation to declare or disclose cash.
It lays down the essential components of the definition of ‘cash’, while at the same time enabling the Commission to amend the non-essential components in response to the attempts by criminals and their associates to circumvent a measure which controls only one type of highly-liquid store of value by bringing another type across the external borders.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all persons, their luggage, the means of transport used to cross the EU’s external borders and any unaccompanied consignment or receptacle crossing that border which may contain cash. It does not apply to persons entering or leaving the EU.
The definition of cash includes:
prepaid cards, in particular if they can be bought without customer due diligence procedures;
cash couriers;
bills, cheques and other forms of payment.
EU countries must:
ensure that the competent authorities collect and perform controls on cash movements;
notify the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Europol of any non-compliance with the rules of the regulation;
identify and inform the OLAF and the Europol if there are indications of criminal activity;
share information relating to sub-threshold amounts with the authorities in other EU countries if there is indications of serious criminal activity.
In addition, the regulation sets out a number of standardised data elements, such as the personal details of the declarant, the owner or the recipient, the economic provenance and the intended use of the cash, which must be recorded in order to achieve the objectives of this regulation. These data must be exchanged between EU countries and with the Commission, in accordance with standards to be set out in implementing acts adopted by the European Parliament and of the Council.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The Regulation has applied since 1 April 2017. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 2018.
BACKGROUND
The introduction of Directive 91/308/EEC (see summary) has led to an increase in cash movements for illicit purposes, which could pose a threat to the financial system and the internal market.

Resolution of failing banks in the European Union: Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)
Resolving failed banks within the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 on the resolution of banks
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a centralised resolution mechanism for all banks operating in the Member States participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism.
It aims to ensure that the resolution decisions made by Member States’ national authorities are consistent and transparent.
KEY POINTS
The resolution mechanism (SSM) is based on the European System of Supervision and Resolution Mechanisms (ESRSM).
The SSM is the only resolution mechanism in the EU that is open to all Member States. It is designed to ensure a neutral approach in dealing with failing banks and therefore increase stability of the banks of the participating Member States and prevent the spill-over of crises into non-participating Member States, thus facilitating the functioning of the internal market as a whole.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is the sole supervisor of the SSM. Although the ECB will not supervise those institutions on a solo basis, it will be the only supervisor that will have a global perception of the risk which a group, and indirectly its individual members, is exposed to. The ECB is responsible for the supervision of the EU’s banking sector.
Member States are required to transfer to the Fund the contributions that they raise at national level in accordance with Directive 2014/59/EU and this regulation. The European Stability and Financial Stability Facility (ESFSP) is also an integral part of the scheme.
In addition, the European Commission is an observer in the resolution decision-making process. The Commission and the Council of the Union are also involved in the implementation of the resolution resolution mechanism.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
The regulation has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The EU has been working towards a single resolution mechanism since 2013.

Noise-related operating restrictions at European Union airports
Noise - related operating restrictions
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 552/2013 on noise-related air traffic management
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to reduce the noise impact from aircraft at EU airports.
It sets out the procedure for the imposition of operating restrictions.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all airports in the European Union (EU). It does not apply to airports located in non-EU countries.
A Member State in which an airport is located must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for the process to be followed when adopting an operating restriction. These authorities must be independent of any organisation which could be affected by the action.
The competent authorities must also ensure that local residents, or their representatives, and relevant local authorities are consulted, and that technical information on noise measures is provided to them.
Where a noise problem has been identified, additional noise abatement measures should be identified in accordance with the balanced approach methodology. These measures should not lead to delay in the implementation of operational measures which could immediately alleviate the noise problem without substantially affecting the operational capacity of an airport.
In addition, Member States, or airport managing bodies, as appropriate, may offer economic incentives to encourage aircraft operators to use less noisy aircraft during the transitional period referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the regulation.
Member States must ensure that:
airport operators are consulted in a transparent way on the intended actions;
the measures are adopted and sufficient notification is provided;
measures are implemented;
dispute resolution is provided for.
Airport managing bodies must communicate with the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
The European Commission is responsible for implementing the regulation in the field of noise management. The Commission may adopt delegated acts for technical updates through delegated acts as appropriate.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMISSION APPLY?
The Regulation has applied since 1 January 2013.
BACKGROUND
   
 
The noise situation at airports is one of the main challenges facing the EU. It is a major factor in the development of the EU’s air transport system. The regulation aims to improve the soundness of the air transport network and to reduce noise.
For more information, see:
Air traffic management (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Air traffic management: the management of air traffic at an airport in order to ensure the effective functioning of EU transport systems and the protection of the environment.
* Noise: the noise emitted by aircraft and ground equipment in the vicinity of the airport. It includes the noise generated by the aircraft and the noise produced by the ground equipment.

Liability and compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 552/2012 on the liability of carriers by sea and passengers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a single set of rules governing the rights of carriers* and passengers* in the case of an accident.
It applies to the carriage of passengers by sea within a single EU country on board ships of Classes A and B under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC, and lays down certain supplementary requirements.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
passengers carried in a ship:
under a contract of carriage;
who, with the consent of the carrier, is accompanying a vehicle or live animals which are covered by a contract;
the IMO Reservation and Guidelines for Implementation of the Athens Convention adopted by the Legal Committee of the International Maritime Organisation on 19 October 2006.
The liability of a carrier and a performing carrier is governed by Article 3(3) of the Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974 and the Protocol of 2002 to the Convention.
Passengers are entitled to compensation in respect of:
the loss of mobility equipment or other specific equipment used by a passenger with reduced mobility,
the damage caused to passengers’ mobility equipment,

In addition, the carrier and performing carrier must provide passengers with at least the information contained in a summary of the provisions of the regulation prepared by the European Commission and made public. This information must be made available to the public and to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (EU).
The European Commission may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, to settle disputes between the EU and the European Economic Area countries. These measures should include liability rules for damage caused by passengers, since it is important to ensure that a proper level of compensation is paid.
EU countries may choose to defer application of this regulation until 4 years after the date of its application.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
   
It has applied since 31 December 2012. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2013.

It establishes a framework for the establishment, management and operation of freight freight networks in the EU.
It aims to improve the efficiency of the rail freight transport relative to other modes of transport.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out the conditions for the selection of further freight corridors.
The European Commission must consult the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), a European economic interest grouping, and the Committee of European Union Member States on the establishment of the freight corridor.
Each Member State must establish a freight corridor at the latest 2 years after the decision of the Commission.
Member States must establish an executive board responsible for defining the general objectives of the corridor, supervising and taking the measures as expressly provided for in Article 7 of the regulation, and in Article 9 and 11 of the annex to the regulation.
An executive board is responsible for:
monitoring and evaluating the performance of the railway freight services along the corridor;
ensuring the availability of capacity, fluid movements and a coherent application of priority rules to the different types of traffic in the event of disturbance;
coordinating the activities of the infrastructure managers;
organising the development of intermodal freight terminals;
the coordination of freight services between the terminals.
In addition to the executive board, an advisory board is set up. It may take the form of an economic interest group, which may also coordinate its activities in order to ensure, on the corridors concerned, the availability and fluid movements of freight trains.
A committee composed of representatives of the Member States, the EEIG and the European Commission, advises the Commission on the implementation of this regulation. The committee may issue an advisory recommendation to the Commission, which then adopts a decision to establish a new freight corridor or to prolong an existing one.

Judiciary cooperation in Civil matters
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 552/2009 on the conclusion of agreements between the European Community and a third country on matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that the European Union (EU) has exclusive competence to conclude agreements on matters relating to jurisdiction and the recognition and enforceability of judgments.
It sets out the conditions under which EU countries can conclude agreements with non-European Union countries.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all civil matters covered by Article 300 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. It does not apply to certain regional agreements between a few EU countries, for example two or three, intended to address local situations and not open for accession to other countries, which are not covered by this regulation.
EU countries must notify the European Commission of ongoing or already announced negotiations with a view to obtaining an authorisation to open formal negotiations. The Commission must be kept fully informed throughout the different stages of the negotiations and should be allowed to participate as an observer in the negotiations as regards those matters.
The Commission may propose negotiating guidelines and may request the inclusion of particular clauses in the envisaged agreement. If necessary, the Commission may decide to include these in the agreement.
Authorisation of the opening of formal negotiations is subject to a number of conditions, including:
a description of the subject matter and scope of the agreement,
the number of EU countries involved and the number of countries involved.
the nature and duration of the negotiation.
If the Commission considers that the agreement does not meet the conditions laid down in the regulation, it may refuse to authorise its conclusion.

Summary 152:
Auditing of statutory auditors and audit firms in the European Union (EU) (Regulation (EC) No 552/2014)
Auditing and auditing of the statutory auditor and audit firm
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2014/34/EU on statutory audits
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the conditions for the approval of the persons responsible for carrying out the statutory audit as well as the minimum requirements for carrying it out.
It aims to ensure the independence of statutory audit** and audit* firms.
KEY POINTS
The statutory audit of cooperatives and savings banks is characterised in some EU countries by a system that does not allow them to choose their statutory auditor or audit firm freely.
The regulation establishes a procedure for the selection of a new statutory auditor. The selection of the auditor and the audit firm must be approved by the competent authorities of the EU country in which the audited entity is located. The competent authorities must cooperate with each other, where necessary, for the purpose of carrying out their supervisory duties regarding statutory audits.
In order to ensure a high level of investor and consumer confidence in the internal market by avoiding conflicts of interests, the statutory audits are subject to appropriate oversight by competent authorities which are independent from the audit profession and which have adequate capacity, expertise and resources. They must also be subject to a system of quality assurance, thus ensuring objectivity and independence.
EU countries may decide to allow statutory audits to provide certain tax and valuation services when such services are immaterial or have no direct effect, separately or in the aggregate, on audited financial statements. However, this does not constitute an infringement of any legislative or regulatory provision in force in the EU countries concerned.
A statutory audit must be carried out by a statutory auditor* or an audit firm* subject to stringent requirements. The statutory audit report must contain sufficient information on the independence and independence of the audit auditor or the auditor firm and on whether the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud.
An audit committee is established to ensure that the audit is carried out in accordance with the quality standards laid down in the regulation. The committee must ensure that:
the statutory auditor is independent of any conflicts of interest;
the audit report is prepared by an independent audit firm;
there is a maximum duration of a statutory audit engagement of at least 3 years for a particular auditor or a particular audit firm in the case of a cooperative or savings bank;
it is important that the role of an audit committee in the selection process is reinforced, in the interest of a more informed decision of the general meeting of shareholders or members of an audited company.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGULATION APPLY?
The legislation has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
   
 
For more information, see:
Statutory audits (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Statutory audit: an audit of a company’s financial statements, including its audited accounts.
* Audit firm: an independent firm that carries out an audit on behalf of the company or on its behalf.

Securities settlement systems — Regulation (EU) No 652/2014
Securities Settlement Systems — Regulations (EU, Euratom) No 596/2014 and (EU), Euratom
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 608/2014 on securities settlement systems
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the establishment of a European Securities Settlement System (CSD)*.
It aims to ensure that the securities settlement system (SSS) operated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) are compatible with the prudential requirements of the European Financial Stability Board (ESCB).
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all financial instruments that are traded on the EU’s securities settlement markets. It does not apply to transactions that are negotiated privately by the relevant parties, but executed on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation No 600/2014 or to transactions executed bilaterally, but reported to a trading venue.
It applies to:
transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances;
transactions that are executed by a CSD in another EU country;
trading venues that are not regulated by the ESCB.
The rules apply to all securities settlement procedures, including the following:
the execution of a buy-in procedure;
the settlement instructions on the same financial instruments;
settlement of the obligation on the intended settlement date.
the acceptance of a settlement order;
by the competent authority of the host EU country of the CSD.
Settlement procedures and penalties
The procedures for settlement fails must be commensurate with the scale and seriousness of such fails whilst being scaled in such a way that maintains and protects the liquidity of the relevant financial instruments.
In order to ensure the safety of settlement, any participant in a securities settlement* system buying or selling certain financial instruments, namely transferable securities*, money market instruments, unit in collective Investment undertakings, emission allowances, should be able to settle its obligation on its intended settlement day.
EU countries must ensure that their competent authorities have access to all information concerning the activities of the competent authorities of the central securities settlement authorities of their home country.
Where a CSDs provides its services in another country, the competent national authority of that country must request from the competent competent authority in the host country all information about the activities and activities of that CSD that is of relevance to the requesting authority. This information must be provided in the form of a standardised recording, which must be made available to the authorities of that host country. It must also be provided to the European Central Bank (ECB).
The ESCB, any other bodies performing similar functions in certain EU countries or other public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt in the EU may themselves provide a number of services, such as operating a securities-settlement system, which would qualify them as CSDs. This regulation does not prevent it from accessing the information relevant for the performance of its duties, including oversight of CSDs and other financial market infrastructures.
Exemptions
The Regulation does not cover:
services provided by CSDs outside the territory of the EU, including through setting up a branch in a non-EU country; or
the services provided by non-CSDs that are provided outside the EU.

Summary 158:
Cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation with the EU’s neighbouring countries (Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013)
Cross-boundary, cross-border and intra-regional coordination with non-EU countries
The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is the main instrument of the European cohesion policy (EU cohesion policy). It aims to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps.
ACT
Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1303/2013 of 25 November 2013 establishing the European Regional development Fund.
SUMMARY
This regulation establishes the European territorial cooperation goal for the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). The ESIF is one of the main instruments of the EU cohesion policy.
The ESIF aims to:
support and facilitate, through specific arrangements, effective trans-border cooperation with countries outside the EU;
promote high employment that results in social and territorial cohesion, including through activities supporting sustainable tourism, culture and natural heritage as part of a territorial strategy aimed at achieving employment-friendly growth;
develop administrative capacity.
This Regulation sets out specific provisions concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the ERDF, and defines the goals for those activities. It also sets out the specific character of cooperation programmes, which are set out in an annex to the regulation.
Crossborder cooperation
The ERDF is to support or, as appropriate, to establish cross-bilateral cooperation with EU countries which border the EU. This cooperation should aim to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the EU's cohesion policy priorities, and should also include maritime cooperation not covered by cross-based cooperation programmes.
Transnational cooperation
This cooperation should support and facilitate effective cooperation between EU countries’ neighbouring regions. It should be focused on:
developing administrative capacity;
strengthening cooperation in the areas of transport, information and communication technology;
improving the quality of life of people in the regions of the participating EU countries;
encouraging the exchange of information and skills between the participating regions;
enhancing the capacity of the administrative authorities of participating regions to manage and implement cooperation programmes;
ensuring the effective implementation of the cooperation programme.
In addition, the European Territorial Cooperation goal should be concentrated on a limited number of thematic objectives in order to maximise the impact of cohesion policy across the Union.
Interregional Cooperation programmes
The Commission is to define transnational cooperation areas having regard to actions needed to promote integration territorial development. These areas are to be developed in line with the objectives of the InterACT and ESPON programmes. In addition, these cooperation programmes should be adapted, especially as regards the definition of the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the current INTERACT (Inter-European Coordination for the Development of the North-East of Europe) programmes. These programmes should also be adapted to the needs of the regions which participate in these programmes, and to the specific requirements of the ESIF.
Cooperation programmes must be approved by the participating Member States and the European Commission. The Commission approves only the core elements of the programmes, while the other elements are approved by each participating Member State or Member States.
Financing
The main sources of ERDF funding are:
the ESIF's investment for growth and jobs goal;
the investment for jobs goal. The ERDF also provides for:
transnational cooperation;
economic and social cohesion;
environmental protection;
transport;
agriculture and forestry;
science and technology; and
municipalities and rural areas.
EU Member States are to set out the resources allocated to each of the different components of the ETSIF, while maintaining a significant concentration on cross- border cooperation.

trans-European electricity transmission and distribution networks;
interconnections of gas and oil pipelines;
transport infrastructure;
railways;
telecommunications infrastructure.
EU countries must:
coordinate the planning and implementation of these projects;
cooperate with the European Commission to identify synergies whenever to do so makes sense from an overall economic, technical, environmental or spatial planning point of view and with due regard to the relevant safety aspects;
security of supply and security of supply;
ensure transparency and public participation in the decision-making procedures;
take the necessary measures to ensure that projects are approved on time.
In addition, EU countries should:
identify and designate European critical infrastructures as set out in Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection;
provide the public with the necessary information and information on the status of the projects; and
take steps to ensure the transparency and participation of the public in the granting of permits, regulatory issues and financing.
The European Commission has adopted a communication on the priorities identified by the Commission for the energy infrastructure by 2020. It calls on EU countries to:
promote investment in energy infrastructure in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy;
improve the efficiency of the energy network;
increase the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20 % by 2020;
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % and achieve a 20 % increase in energy efficiency by 2020 whereby energy efficiency gains may contribute to reducing the need for construction of new infrastructure. The Commission also calls on the Commission to adopt a new energy infrastructure policy to optimise network development at European level for the period up to 2020 to meet its core energy policy objectives of competitiveness, sustainability and security.
Background
The Commission has identified a number of strategic objectives for energy infrastructure. These include:
modernising and expanding the European electricity network and the interconnecting of gas pipelines and transmission networks across the EU;

Agreement between the EU and the Nordic countries on the surrender of suspects to the authorities of the EU countries
Agreement with the Nordic Countries on the cooperation of the judicial authorities in extradition matters
SUMMARY OF:
Decision 2008/852/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Iceland on the extradition of suspected criminals
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?
The agreement aims to improve the extradition system between, on the one hand, the Member States and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries: Norway, Iceland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1).
The decision concludes the agreement on behalf of the European Community (now the EU).
KEY POINTS
The extradition system is based on a mechanism of surrender pursuant to an arrest warrant.
The arrest warrant is issued by the judicial authority of the country which is competent to issue it by virtue of the law of that country. The issuing judicial authority may refuse to execute the warrant if:
the offence has been committed in whole or in part in the territory of the executing country or in a place treated as such;
the act was committed outside the country of the issuing country and the law does not allow prosecution for the same offences when committed outside its territory.
When the executing judicial authority refuses to execute a warrant, it must provide a description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time, place and degree of participation in the offence by the requested person, the penalty imposed, if there is a final judgment, or the prescribed scale of penalties for the offence.
If a person does not comply with the conditions of the arrest warrant, the country that issued the warrant may request that the person be handed over to the country where the custodial sentence or detention order has been passed against him or her.
Where a person refuses to comply with a request for extradition, the EU country which has issued the request may make a declaration to the effect that he or she will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions.
In addition, the countries which have signed the agreement may request the European Security and Intelligence Service (SIS) to transmit all the information it receives to the European Judicial Network (EJN). The SIS is capable of transmitting all of the information described in the agreement to the EJN.
An arrest warrant may not be executed if the person concerned:
is a national of one of the countries covered by the agreement;
has been convicted of a criminal offence in another country;
is considered to be a threat to public order or public security.
EU countries can establish an obligation or an option to refuse to act on an execution warrant in the following cases:
if, in one of these cases, the act on which the warrant has been issued is regarded as having been committed:
in part or in whole in the country covered by it;
in a place which is not treated as a place of public security;
on the grounds of double criminality;
if the offence is punishable by a maximum sentence of at least 5 years’ imprisonment.
Other grounds for non-execution of the warrant include:
a lack of evidence of the offence being committed;
a breach of the secrecy of the person being sought;
an absence of a written record of the arrested person.
A person who refuses to cooperate with the authorities may be refused the right to appeal against the refusal.
FROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?
They have applied since 1 January 2008.
BACKGROUND
The EU and its EU countries have adopted a common extradition policy.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes the framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products.
It aims to simplify the administrative burden associated with the use of the EU Ecolabelling scheme.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all food and feed products, as well as unprocessed agricultural products that lie within the scope of Regulation (EC).
It does not apply to medicinal products for human use, as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicines, or for veterinary use, or to any type of medical device.
The European Commission adopts measures to establish specific criteria for each product group. The Commission consults the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Economic and Business Board (EIB) to determine which group of products are eligible for the ecolabelled status.
Requirements
The criteria must include requirements intended to ensure that the products bearing the EU environmental label function adequately in accordance with their intended use.
EU countries must ensure that competent bodies meet the requirements laid down in Annex V of the regulation.
Products that are certified as organic would not be eligible for award of an EU EColabel, to avoid confusion for consumers.
They must be accompanied by a product identification number (EICN) issued by the European Commission.
In addition, the Commission must:
ensure that the product meets the requirements set out in Annex VI;
apply for the Ecol label within 6 months of receiving an application from the EU country in which the product is registered;
assess the products’ environmental performance;
check that they comply with the requirements in Annex VII;
provide the competent body with all the relevant documentation;
conduct investigations to verify compliance with the criteria;
identify products that do not meet the criteria.
Ecolabels are awarded to products that fulfil all the requirements of the Regulation (Annex VIII).
The Commission may, no later than 9 months after consulting the EUEFSA and the EUEB, adopt measures to define specific criteria. The European Commission is responsible for the development and revision of the criteria and for any review of the implementation of the scheme. It may also invite any interested party to lead the development or revision of these criteria, provided that common procedural rules are followed and that the process is coordinated by the Commission. It must also consult the European Environment Agency (EEA).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2008.
