Dumping of agricultural products by non-EU countries
Dumping on agricultural products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 — anti-dumping measures
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
 
It lays down rules for the imposition of anti-subsidiary* and countervailing* duties on imports of certain agricultural products from non-European Union countries.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all agricultural products originating in the EU, except for certain products originating outside the EU.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 182/2011 on the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
Implementing measures
Imposition of duties
Importers are required to pay a duty of at least 2 % of the value of the imports they receive.
The duty is calculated on the basis of the average price of the products imported and the price at which the duty is being absorbed by the exporter through a form of compensatory arrangement and the measures are not being reflected in the prices of products subject to measures in the European Union (EU).
Imports must not be made subject to registration for a period longer than 9 months. Imports are subject to import duties of up to 2 % for individual exporters and they remain subject to proceedings and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent review carried out for the country concerned pursuant to the rules laid down in the regulation.
Provisional or definitive duties
Duties may be imposed by the EU countries on the following a request from an interested party to the European Commission.
Duty rates are calculated according to:
the average price paid by the country of origin;
the percentage of the duty paid by each exporter to the EU as a whole or by a group of exporters.
Duration, reviews and refunds
The Commission may, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 15(2) of the regulation, accept satisfactory voluntary undertaking offers submitted by any importer to revise its prices or to cease exports at dumped prices, if it is satisfied that the injurious effect of the dumping is thereby eliminated.
An expiry review may be initiated where the request contains sufficient evidence that the expiry of the measures would result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury.
Expiry of measures
The exporter may request the Commission to terminate the measures if it considers that a threat of injury is more likely to be realised if the dumped imports continue. The Commission must provide information to EU countries once it has received sufficient information justifying the reopening of the investigation and the Commission has completed its analysis of the case.
In addition, the Commission may grant exemptions to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of this regulation. In addition, exemptions may be granted to producers whose production process, producers' sales and profits are not affected by the measures.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATE APPLY?
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a number of measures to combat dumping, including:
Directive 2014/56/EU on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on the protection of intellectual property rights and on the facilitation of trade in goods between the EU and non-member countries (see summary);
Implementation Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 558/2015 laying down the rules for implementing Implementing Decision 2014/58/EU laying down certain customs measures and implementing Decision (EU), Euratom Implementing Regulation (Euratom) 2018/852 laying down rules on the implementation of Implementing Directive 2014/57/EU (see Summary).

Early intervention and resolution of failing credit derivatives trading venues
Early intervention & resolution
SUMMARY OF:
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1132 on early intervention and early intervention of credit derivatives clearing venues
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATION?
It aims to improve the early intervention* and resolution procedures for failing credit derivative trading venues (CCPs) in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all credit derivatives traded on the EU’s financial markets.
It sets out the rules for early intervention (i.e. when a CCP fails) and early resolution (e.g. when its assets or liabilities are deemed to be irrecoverable) of failing CCPs.
The resolution authorities must:
make a rapid valuation of the assets or the liabilities of a failing CCP;
prepare a recovery plan and submit it to the resolution authority within 3 to 6 months of the CCP's failure;
identify any measures that may adversely affect the resolvability of the failing CCP.
Implementation of the resolution plan must be subject to the approval or consent of the competent authority.
A resolution authority must examine the recovery plan in order to identify any measures which may adversely impact the resolution.
In the event of a non-default event, the CCP must submit a business reorganisation plan alongside a business restructuring plan.
An early intervention report must be prepared by the resolution authorities within 2 months of its failure.
If a resolution authority considers that the failure of a CCP would not effectively reduce or remove the impediments identified in the report, it must identify alternative measures which would reduce or eliminate those impediments.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULING APPLACE APPLY?
The implementing regulation applies from 1 January 2022.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission has adopted a series of measures to ensure that the resolution of failed CCPs is as swift as possible.

European Year for Railways
European Year FOR RAINWAYS
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2021/852 — promoting rail transport
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It aims to promote rail transport during the European Year 2021 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels.
KEY POINTS
The European Green Deal is a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.
The year 2021 will be important for the EU rail policy, since it will represent the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the EU, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services, on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the EU and on providing the European Union Agency for RailWAYS (ERA) with additional tasks that aim to lower technical barriers.
To achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050. For that shift to take place, significant investments are needed, including investments made in the context of the recovery of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and efforts to increase the efficiency of the rail freight corridors.
In order to achieve this, the European Commission must take the necessary measures to:
promote rail transport as a competitive and environmentally friendly mode of transport;
encourage the use of rail networks and encourage businesses to switch their transport to rail;
increase investment in rail infrastructure;
improve the safety of passengers and freight;
ensure the smooth operation of rail passenger services;
support the development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), terminals offering modal shift options, as well as modernised rolling stock.
During the year 2021, the Commission should consider initiating a study on the feasibility of creating a European label to promote goods and products transported by rail,
introducing a rail connectivity index, with the aim of categorising the level of integration achieved through rail services on the rail network and showing the potential of rail to compete with other modes of transport.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The decision has applied since 1 January 2021.
BACKGROUND
The EU is committed to becoming a climate-neutral society by 2050, which means reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and CO2 emissions from transport by 90%.
For more information, see:
European Green Deal (European Commission).

If such sales to any appropriate third country do not exist or do not permit a proper comparison, the normal price must be calculated on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits.
Importers of the ship are responsible for determining whether the sale is injurious to the EU industry.
If the shipbuilder concerned does not pay the charge, countermeasures under the form of denial of loading and unloading rights may be imposed on the vessels built by the shipbuilders in question.

Bananas — EU-Central America stabilisation mechanism for imports of bananas
Bananas – EU-Cuba agreement
SUMMARY OF:
Agreement between the EU and Central America on the stabilisation of the trade in bananas
Regulation (EU) No 552/2013 on the application of the bilateral safeguard clause and the mechanism for stabilisation for bananas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE REGULATION?
The agreement between the European Union and the Central American countries of bananas aims to prevent or remedy serious injury to the EU’s banana industry as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty on bananas imported from Central America.
The regulation sets out the conditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures, for the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for suspending temporarily the preferential customs duty.
KEY POINTS
The EU and Côte d'Ivoire signed the agreement on 29 June 2012.
It applies to products originating in the EU or in Central America and those sectors to which monitoring has been extended.
In the event of an increase of imports concentrated in one or several of the EU's outermost regions or Member States, the Commission may decide to introduce safeguard measures.
Provisional safeguard measures apply to every product which is put into free circulation after the date of entry into force of the regulation.
Prior surveillance measures are applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination on the basis of the factors referred to in Article 5(5 of the agreement.
Stabilisation mechanism
The stabilising measures apply only to products which have been reduced or eliminated from the customs duties in accordance with the Tariff Elimination Schedule (TES) and which are not covered by the agreement with Central America, except for bananas which are covered by a transitional period.
Implementing measures
The Commission may impose safeguard measures if:
there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as a consequence of a reduction in customs duty or a suspension of customs duty, and that such imports cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the Union industry;
the level of production, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment of the banana sector particularly vulnerable.
If the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2(1) are not met, a decision terminating the investigation and proceeding without measures is adopted.
Before imposing a safeguard measure, a notice must be sent to the country concerned. The notice must include a summary of the share of the domestic market taken by the increased imports and changes in the level of sales, production and productivity of the sector.
A decision to initiate a proceeding must contain evidence that:
the conditions for imposing the safeguard measure are met and that there is evidence that the EU industry is adjusting;
there are special reasons therefor.
Termination of investigations and proceedings without measures
Implementation of the measures is subject to the consent of the country in question.
FROM WHEN DOES THE AGENCY APPLY?
   
The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The European Commission is responsible for the implementation of the Agreement.

Summary 126:
Fisheries management of stocks of common interest in the North Sea and the Baltic
Fishing management of species of common interests in the north sea
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the EU’s fisheries management of North Sea stocks
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the management of common stocks of stocks belonging to common interest (MSY) in EU waters.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all stocks of species belonging to the common interest of the EU and its Member States.
It does not apply to:
fishing opportunities;
by-catch stocks;
fisheries managed in mixed fisheries;
target fishing mortality (FMSY).
The European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts adjusting the geographical distribution of stocks set out in the plan if the scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicates a change in the distribution of the relevant stocks.
Management of MSY
The aim of the regulation is to restore MSY to levels that can produce MSY as determined by their biological characteristics.
To achieve this objective, the European Commission must draw up a multiannual management plan. The plan must contain objectives, quantifiable targets with clear timeframes, conservation reference points, safeguards and technical measures designed to avoid and reduce unwanted catches.
The plan must contribute to the elimination of discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to the implementation of the landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and to not more than 20 % of the maximum allowable catch.
In addition, the Commission must take into account the significant impact of recreational fisheries on MSY on the marine ecosystem.
Fishery opportunities
The target fishing mortality must be fixed at levels consistent with a fishing mortality that is reduced below the upper range of FMSY, taking account of the decrease in biomass.
Mixed fisheries
The management of mixed fisheries with regard to stocks referred to in Article 1(s) of this regulation must take account of:
the difficulty of fishing all stocks at MSY at the same time, especially in situations where that leads to a premature closure of the fishery;
the inter-species stock dynamics;
in order to limit variations in fishing opportunities between consecutive years to a maximum of 20 %.
Limiting discards
The Commission is also empowered to introduce measures to reduce discards.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATING APPLY?
   
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted a series of measures to tackle overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices.
For more information, see:
‘Overfishing and illegal fishing’ (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Common interest: a stock of fish belonging to a common interest that is not exploited by non-EU countries.
* By-catch: fish that are not part of a common fishery.

Benchmark Integrity and relationability requirements
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 on benchmarks
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules for the use of benchmarks to ensure their integrity and independence.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
investment benchmarks* and non-interest rate benchmarks* that are used in the European Union (EU).
It does not apply to interest rate benchmarks such as Libor, Euribor or Eurica.
It applies to benchmarks that are not considered to be critical benchmarks and that are subject to a process to determine whether they should be considered critical benchmarks.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has the power to impose sanctions on any non-compliance with the regulation’s rules.
Contributors to a benchmark
A benchmark is considered a critical benchmark if:
it is used in more than one EU country;
it has a significant impact on the financial stability of the economy of the country in which it is published.
A critical benchmark may not be used if it does not meet certain conditions, such as:
a minimum level of liquidity;
a high degree of reliability;
an absence of conflicts of interest between the contributor and the author of the benchmark;
the contribution of a non-significant benchmark to a significant benchmark does not exceed a maximum amount of €500,000.
Critical benchmarks can be determined using a quantitative criterion or a qualitative criterion.
Non-significant benchmarks
A significant benchmark is defined as a benchmark that does not have a significant effect on the economic stability of an EU country.
Administrators
An administrator must publish, by means that ensure fair and easy access, a benchmark statement for each benchmark or, where applicable, for each family of benchmarks, that may be used in EU countries.
In addition, an administrator must:
ensure that a benchmark is published in a language that is easily understood by the general public;
keep a register of all the contributors and users of a benchmark.
If an administrator does not publish a benchmark, he or she must inform the competent authority of the EU country where the benchmark was published or disseminated, as well as publish a corrective statement about any past contributions to or figures of that benchmark, in accordance with the rules of the European Commission.
Monitoring
An EU country may decide to prohibit a benchmark from being used in another EU country if it considers that it is not consistent with the requirements of the regulation or that it has not complied with its obligations under the relevant legislation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 30 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
 
For more information, see:
Key terms used in benchmarks (European Commission).
