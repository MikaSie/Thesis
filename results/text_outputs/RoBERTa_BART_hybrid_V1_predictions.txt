SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?
It sets out rules on the interpretation and exploitation of copyright (i.e. the right to reproduce a work of art) and other related rights.
It aims to facilitate cross-border provision of online services that are ancillary to broadcasts.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive applies to:
radio and television programmes transmitted by broadcasting organisations;
online services that originate in other Member States;
replays of television or radio programmes;
the collective management and management of copyright-related rights in relation to retransmits of these rights; and

Rights of the broadcasting organisations
Radio and television broadcasting organisations transmit daily many hours of television programmes. These organisations have ongoing commercial relations with broadcasting organisations, and as a result are known to operators of broadcasting services.
Radio broadcasting organisations are responsible for the transmission of programmes through direct injection.
The collective management bodies responsible for managing the rights are:
collective management organisations that manage rights for the territory of the EU Member State for which the operator of a retransmitter services seeks to clear rights for a programme;
radio broadcasting organisations which manage the rights for retranscasts of radio programmes transmitted in the Member State in which they originate.
Where a rightholder has not transferred the management of the right referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of the directive, the collective managing organisation which manages rights of that category of right for the country of origin of the operator seeking to clear the right for a television programme for which it seeks to grant or refuse the authorisation.
In such cases, it is possible to call upon the assistance of one or more mediators as provided for in Article 11 of Directive 93/83/EC where there is no agreement between the rightholders and the operators of the services seeking to cover the rights. The mediators must ensure that the parties concerned comply with EU law, on limitations, including territorial limitations, to the exploitation or exploitation of their rights. They must also ensure that:
the parties concerned have the right of contractual freedom to limit the exploitation and the rights affected by the principles set out in this directive, provided that any such limitation is in compliance with Union law.
If the parties fail to comply with these principles, they must inform the European Commission and the European Parliament of the reasons for their decision.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
The legislation has applied since 1 January 2007. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 2008.
BACKGROUND
The EU’s digital broadcasting directive, which has been amended several times, is one of the most important legal instruments in the fight against copyright infringement in the digital age. It aims to improve the quality of the online content offered by broadcasters and to ensure that there is a diverse content offer, which is also in the interest of consumers.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the detection and removal of content online that incites terrorist acts.
KEY POINTS
Hosting service providers must act with due diligence and implement safeguards, where appropriate, including human oversight and verifications, to avoid any unintended or erroneous decision leading to the removal of or disabling of access to content that is not terrorist content.
They must apply those provisions in a diligent, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory manner.
EU countries must ensure that a contact point is designated or established within the competent authority to handle requests for clarification and feedback in relation to removal orders issued by that competent authority. This contact point should serve only for operational purposes.
The hosting service provider must provide the complainant with the reasons for its decision. The reasons should not imply the disclosure of sensitive information which could jeopardise ongoing investigations.
Complaint procedures must be in place to ensure that the removal order is complied with. The complainant must submit, within 48 hours of receiving either a removal order or information pursuant to Article 11(2), a reasoned request to the competent authorities of the EU country where the hosting services provider has its main establishment or where its legal representative resides or is established to scrutinise the order. The competent authorities must then decide whether to accept or reject the reasoned request.
In addition, EU countries must:
ensure that the complainant has the right to:
review proceedings, as soon as the grounds for the removal have ceased to exist;
reinstitute access to the content that has been removed or access to which has been disabled, as well as to ensure the reinstatement of that content, depending on the outcome of those proceedings.
Requests for clarification or feedback must be made publicly available.
If a service provider fails to comply with an order, the complainant must have the right of:
an effective remedy;
to be informed of the reason for the decision;
the possibility to appeal the decision.

The European border control system (ebates) must keep logs of all data processing operations in the ESP. It must also report to the programme management board, which is composed of representatives of the EU countries and the EBCG.
When a national border guard checks a person’s identity, he or she must indicate in the MID the identity of the person and the colour of the link between the data. The border guard must carry out any additional verification necessary to take a decision on the status and colour of that link.
Where a national authority queries a CIR for information, it must indicate the data referred to in Article 34 of the regulation. The CIR must also indicate the information it has received from Europol and Eurojust.
If a border guard suspects that a person is a threat to public order, he/she must inform the national authorities and the police officers of the country concerned. The national authorities must then inform Europol. The SIS must also notify Europol when it receives a request for information from an EU country.
Measures supporting interoperability
In order to achieve interoperability, the regulation sets out a number of measures, including:
measures to ensure that:
data quality is maintained;
personal data are protected;
data are stored only in a way that is appropriate for the purpose;
there is a clear separation of personal data from other data;
EU information systems should not store DNA profiles or biometric templates obtained from palm print data.
Implementing measures
The Commission has adopted implementing measures to support interoperability. These include:
implementing a communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Member States and the EU agency concerned;

Anti-dumping Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 on the protection of the EU’s internal market against dumping
Anti-Dumping Regulation(EU) no longer codifies and repeals Regulation (EEC) No 182/2011
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for the protection against dumping and injury caused by imports of certain agricultural products from non-EU countries.
It codifies the rules on dumping, injury and countervailing measures adopted by the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
Importers of agricultural products must register with the European Commission before they can export them to the EU. The Commission then investigates whether these products are subject to dumping and/or injury.
Imports must not be made subject to registration for a period longer than 9 months.
Dumping and injury
The aim of the regulation is to prevent the dumping or injury of products originating in the EU by means of imports from countries which are not members of the European Economic Area (EEA).
The regulation does not apply to imports originating in non-EEA countries. However, it may be applicable to imports from the EU's major trading partners.
Provisional or definitive measures
The European Commission may impose provisional or definitive anti–dumping duties on imports originating from countries outside the EEA if it considers that there is a threat of dumping or a causal link between the imports and the dumping of a product and the harm caused by the imports.
The Commission may decide to suspend or reduce the duties if there is sufficient to justify it.
If the Commission considers that the threat of injury is more likely to be realised if the dumped imports continue.
Expiry of the measures
An expiry review may be initiated where there is evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping.
Duration, reviews and refunds
The exporter may submit a voluntary undertaking offer to revise its prices or to cease exports at dumped prices, if it is satisfied that the injurious effect of the dumping is thereby eliminated.
In addition, the Commission may, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in the regulation, accept satisfactory voluntary undertaking offers submitted by any exporter to revise or cease exports.
Where the Commission concludes that the importer has not complied with the conditions laid down in this regulation, the exporter must refund the amount of the duty. The amount of refund must not exceed 2 % for individual exporters and they remain subject to the proceedings and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent review carried out for the country concerned pursuant to Article 11.
EU countries may refuse to grant exemptions to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this regulation. Where the circumventing practice, process or work takes place outside the EU, exemptions may be granted to producers if they are found to be not related the Commission has completed its analysis thereof.
Amendments to the regulation

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 1216/2009 laying down rules on the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural agricultural products.
It aims to improve the transparency of the EU’s internal market for agricultural products and to protect the interests of producers.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to imports of:
agricultural products originating in or exported from the European Union (EU);
foodstuffs originating in, exported from or imported from non-EU countries;
animal feed;
seeds originating in and exported from outside the EU;
sugars and other agricultural inputs.
The European Commission may launch investigations into the subsidisation of agricultural imports if it considers that these imports are causing injury to producers or are likely to cause injury.
Complaints
A complaint may be submitted to the Commission or to a Member State, which forwards it to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
The complaint must be submitted in writing. It must include:
the product and countries concerned;
the name of the producer or exporter or country;
a description of the type of the product and the type and quantity of the inputs to be substituted in the production process.

If the complaint is found to be causing injury, the Commission may decide to open an investigation into the allegations of subsidisation and/or to impose a countervailing duty on the imports of the affected products. The Commission may also impose a provisional or definitive duty on these imports. If the definitive duty is lower than the provisional duty, the duty must be recalculated.
In the event that an investigation is opened, the European Commission must inform the Member States of its analysis of the complaint normally within 21 days of the date on which the complaint was lodged with the Commission.
A committee composed of representatives of Member States and chaired by the Commission is responsible for the management of the investigation. It may request information and may exchange views in the committee or directly with the European Parliament and the Council.
An investigation may be terminated without measures if the Commission concludes that the allegations are not justified. The investigation may continue for a period of 5 years, or be terminated in the event of a finding of injury or if the investigation concludes that there is no evidence that the subsidies are causing harm to the producers or the exporters.
Reviews and refunds
Member States may request a review of the measures in force to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified. If a review, carried out in accordance with the the provisions applicable for such reviews, is justified, a refund may be issued.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 608/2014 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the European Union’s statistical office
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European system of own resources (ESA) for the collection and transmission of statistics on the quality, reliability, comparability and exhaustiveness of the European Gross Value Added (GVA) aggregates.
It sets out the procedures for the transposition of GNI aggregates and their components.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must provide the European Commission (Eurostat) with data on the sources, their uses and the methods used to produce the aggregates by 1 October each year. These data must be reliable, exhaustive and comparable.
The Commission must verify the sources and methods in the inventory of sources, the methods and the sources of the sources used and sources of sources. The inventory must be consistent with ESA 2010 and duplication and overloading must be avoided.
Eurostat must publish a report on the methodology used for producing the data for previous years at the end of each verification cycle. That report must detail the methodology and sources used for the previous years.
Before 1 October every year, Member States must provide Eurostat, in the context of national accounting procedures, with figures for GNI aggregate and components, in accordance with the definitions referred to in Article 1 of the regulation.
GVA aggregates must be comparable and reliable.
Each year, Eurostat must submit a report to the Commission on the reliability, exhaustiveness and ex-post quality of the data it has received. This report must describe the methodology, sources, methods and sources for the GNI and its sources.
In order to ensure that the data are reliable, exhaustible and comparable, the Commission must adopt delegated acts in respect of the list of issues to be addressed in every verification cycle in order to:
ensure the accuracy, reliability and completeness of the information provided by Member States;
identify the sources that are reliable and exhaustive;
verify the methods, sources and sources that have been used in the past verification cycles;
assess the quality of data provided by each Member State;
make necessary adjustments, where applicable, to avoid gaps and double counting.

Summary 34:
EU type-approval procedures for vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units
EU type–approval rules for vehicles and systems
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 on the placing on the market of new vehicles, vehicles, parts, components, separate technical unit and systems of the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the procedures for the granting of EU type‑approval* for vehicles* and systems*, components*, separate technical* units* of the vehicles of the type covered by the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom (U.K.).
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
vehicles, systems* and components* of type-approved vehicles;
separate technical units of type approved by the EU;
vehicle systems, systems and components which have been approved by an EU type‐approval authority.
It does not apply to vehicles which have not been type‐approved by an authority in the EU Member State of the same Member State and which are subject to the same type‐conditions as those of vehicles approved in the Member States of the EU under Directive 2007/46/EC.
The regulations apply to the following types of vehicles:
end-of‐series vehicles, including:
cars,
crossovers,
trucks,
motorcycles,
battery-electricity vehicles,
trailers, and
cargo vehicles.
Vehicle type‐type-approvals are also held by manufacturers established in Member States other than the United Nations (UN) Member States.
Member States must notify the European Commission of the vehicle type‐certificate of conformity and the number of certificates issued by the competent authority in relation to the vehicle.
When manufacturers make use of the procedures set out in this regulation, their UK type‐approval may become invalid before EU type-authorisation legislation ceases to apply to and in the UK due to granting of the Union type‐authorisation for the same vehicle. However, Member States may decide to continue to grant the UK type‑certificate until the vehicle’s type‐car type‐conformity has become invalid.
If Member States consider that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU is likely to have a significant impact on the functioning of the single market, they may adopt measures to ensure equal treatment of manufacturers affected by the UK withdrawal from the Union and those holding type‑approved vehicle type certificates.
In this respect, the regulation sets out:
the number of Member States that must inform the Commission when a vehicle, system, component or separate component has been granted EU type•approval;
the date on which the type‑authorisation certificate and the type-certificate have become invalid;
where a Member State has notified the Commission that a vehicle has been given EU type approval, it must inform that Member State that the vehicle has not yet been put on the EU market, registration, sale or entry into service of vehicles conforming to a type whose UK type–authorisation has not become valid before the day the regulation ceases to be applicable.
Where Member States decide that the regulation does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission must adopt measures in accordance with Article 27 of the Treaty on European Union (TFEU) to ensure that Member States continue to have the greatest possible freedom to choose the new Union type–type‐authority.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
 
   
It has applied since 30 March 2019.
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom withdraws from the European Economic Area (EEA) on 1 March 2019 and the EU has to conclude a bilateral agreement with the EU on type‐recognition of vehicles and their systems.
For more information, see:
Vehicles and systems (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Vehicle type: a vehicle of type ‘e.g.’: an engine, transmission, chassis, suspension, differential, separate electrical system, separate mechanical unit, separate electronic component and separate electrical unit.
* System: a system, system or separate electrical component that allows a vehicle to be driven without any steering or suspension input.

Resolution
The resolution of a failing credit institution (CCP) must be carried out by a resolution authority. The resolution authority must:
make a valuation of the assets or liabilities of the failing CCP;
prepare a business reorganisation plan;
identify any measures that may adversely affect the resolvability of the CCP.
It must submit a recovery plan to the resolution authority, which must be approved by the resolution college, which is composed of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Insurance and Financial Services Authority (EIFS).
The recovery plan must include:

If the resolution authorities consider that the resolution plan does not meet the requirements of the resolution regulation, it must communicate this to the ECB and the EIFS for joint decision.
Cooperation between authorities
In the event of a failure of a credit institution, the competent authorities must cooperate with each other in order to ensure that:
the resolution authority:
identifies any measures which may adversely impact the resolution resolution;
ensures that any measures taken by the CCP may be effective in resolving the failure of the credit institution;
coordinates with the other authorities in the area of financial stability;
examines the recovery plans and identifies any measures to be taken in the event that these measures could seriously harm the resolution process.
The ECB and ESMA must cooperate between themselves in the case of failure of credit institutions and with other competent authorities.
When a CCP fails, the ECB is responsible for appointing a resolution committee. The committee:
is composed of representatives of the shareholders and the board of the CCP;
is chaired by the ECB;
has the power to:
approve or reject a resolution proposal;
make recommendations to the European Commission;
recommend or reject the resolution proposal.
Where the resolution committee recommends that a resolution procedure be adopted, the European Banking Authority adopts a resolution decision. The decision must be submitted to the EFSMA and the ECB for approval or consent.
Once the resolution procedure has been adopted and the resolution decision has been taken, the EAFS and EFSSA must communicate the resolution decisions to other authorities, including the European Financial Stability Board (EFSB).
If a resolution plan is rejected by the ESSB or the ECB, the resolution body must communicate its reasons for its rejection to the competent authority.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATING APPLY?
   
It has applied since 14 February 2012.

It will also be the first year where rules will be adopted on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services, on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the EU and on reducing technical barriers. The measures to be taken to achieve the objectives set out in Article 2 shall be closely coordinated with on-going activities promoting rail transport, including:
a study on the feasibility of creating a European label to promote goods and products transported by rail so as to encourage businesses to switch their transport to rail;
a feasibility study with a rail transport to compete with other modes of transport;
an evaluation of the level of integration achieved through the use of services on the rail network;
the creation of a European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS);
the realisation of an extended, modernised and interoperable railway infrastructure, including a European rail traffic management system, terminals offering modal shift options, as well as modernised rolling stock.
In addition, the Commission shall consider initiating, during the European year, studies on:
the feasibility of establishing a European Label to promote good and services by rail,
the introduction of a rail connectivity index,
an improvement of the efficiency of the rail freight corridors.
The Commission shall inform the Council at European level of the measures taken to promote rail transport during the year, including the participation of persons’ organisations and representatives of international organisations in the activities of the Year.

Interchange fees for consumer debit card transactions: rules for issuers, acquirers and consumers
Interchange fee fees for consumers debit card payments: rules on issuers and acquirers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 552/2014 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
   
It sets out rules on the interchange fees* charged by payment card issuers* and by payment service providers* for the processing and storage of payment card transactions.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
debit card transactions carried out with universal cards.
Payment cards are the most frequently used electronic payment instrument for retail purchases in the European Union (EU). They are also the most widely accepted payment instrument in the world for online transactions. However, they have been subject to excessive interchange fees. This has a negative impact on merchants and consumers and prevents innovation.
In order to ensure that interchange fees are set at an economically efficient level, taking into account the structure of domestic debit card markets, the possibility to express interchange fee caps as a flat rate should be maintained.
To acknowledge the existence of implicit interchange fees and contribute to the creation of a level playing field, three party payment card schemes using payment card providers as issuers or acquirers should follow the same rules as four party schemes and should comply with the regulation, whilst transparency and other measures related to business rules should apply to all providers.
Co-badging and choice of payment brand or payment application
The European Banking Authority (EBA) is responsible for issuing payment cards must ensure that:
payment cards are issued by the same issuer or acquirer as those issued by national banks;
payment services are provided by a single issuer or a single acquirer, irrespective of the issuer’s national or cross-border status;
the payment service provider must inform the payee of the amount of the merchant service charges, interchange fees, scheme fees and payment card fees applicable to each category and brand of payment cards, unless the paymentee subsequently makes a different request in writing.
The EBA must submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the European Commission by 9 December 2015. The Commission must adopt those standards and submit them to the EBA within 9 months of the submission of the draft technical standards.
EU countries must designate competent authorities that are empowered to ensure enforcement of this regulation and that are granted investigation and enforcement powers. The bodies must be independent from the parties.
Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the regulation and should ensure that those penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive and that they are applied.
Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 651/2014
In addition, the regulation has been amended by:
Directive 2011/83/EU on e-commerce (see summary) and Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 852/2013 on the electronic payment instruments and services which can be off-line, on-line or mobile.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULE APPLY?
It has applied since 16 September 2014. Member States had to incorporate it into national law by 16 September 2015.
BACKGROUND
The EU has been working towards an integrated market for electronic payments for more than a decade. This regulation aims to ensure the proper functioning and completion of this market.
For more information, see:
‘E-commerce’ (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
* Interchange fee: a fee charged by a payment card issuer or an acquirer to facilitate the payment of a debit card to a consumer.
* Scheme fees: the fees charged by the payment card company to facilitate a payment transaction between two or more payment card companies.

Transparency of skills and qualifications acquired in formal, non-formal and informal settings (‘Europass’)
Transparency and mobility of skills, qualifications and competences (Europass)
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2016/589 establishing a European framework to support the transparency and understanding of qualifications and skills acquired through practical experiences, mobility and volunteering
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It establishes a European platform for the exchange of information between jobseekers, employers and bodies on qualifications and qualifications.
KEY POINTS
The European network of employment services (EURES) is a cooperative network for exchanging information and facilitating interaction between employers and jobseekers and employers. It provides free assistance to jobseekers who wish to move to another country and assists employers wishing to recruit workers from other countries.
The Europass portfolio comprises five document templates. The Europass Curriculum Vitae (CV) template allows individuals to complete their CVs in a standardised format. The Qualifications and Competences (QC) template enables employers to assess and validate the skills they consider necessary for employment.
Europass supplements are issued, in accordance with templates, by the competent authorities or bodies. These supplements provide information on qualifications, skills and competence acquired in informal and formal settings, such as through practical experience, mobility or volunteering.
In order to ensure a smooth transition to the online platform, the Europass internet-based information system established by Decision No 2241/2004/EC should continue to operate until such time as the platform is set up and becomes operational.
A number of options are made available to users to restrict access to their data or persons with disabilities, in order to comply with the accessibility requirements established in relevant EU law. In addition, authentication measures could be used to verify the authenticity of digital documents on qualifications. The decision repeals and repeals Decision No 12/2013/EC.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?
The decision has applied since 31 December 2016.
BACKGROUND
The aim of Europass is to:
ensure the transparency, understanding and verification of qualifications acquired by individuals, employers, competent authorities and bodies;
facilitate the exchange and sharing of information;
improve the quality of the information provided by Europass;
support the development of web-based tools, including those developed by third parties, and by taking into account the specific needs of people with disabilities.

Eurojust’s legal framework — rules on the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals (Regulation (EU) No 1304/2014)
Eurojust's legal framework – rules on privacy and respect for the rights of individuals
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation No 1303/2014/EU on the legal framework of Eurojust
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the rules on Eurojust, a European Union (EU)-wide network of law enforcement and judicial bodies.
It sets out Eurojust's rules on:
the functions of the national members, the College and the Administrative Director;
the College's functions and responsibilities; and
the role of the Executive Board.
KEY POINTS
   
The regulation sets out the rules governing Eurojust‘s legal structure:
EuroJust’ is governed by a College of national members (known as Eurojust College) and an Executive Board (Eurojust Executive Board). It is chaired by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Police Organisation (EPPO). The College meets at least once a month. The Executive Board is composed of representatives of the EU countries’ national members and the EPPO.
The College is responsible for:
monitoring and evaluating Eurojust;
assisting Eurojust in its work;
ensuring that Eurojust complies with the rules of the European Criminal Police Office (Interpol); and
keeping a record of operational personal data.
In the event of a personal data breach, Eurojust must notify the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. It may also order, request or execute any request for mutual legal assistance or mutual recognition, as provided for in Directive 2014/41/EU.
Annex I of the regulation lists the categories of categories of processing activities Eurojust may undertake, including:
operational personal data relating to the circumstances of an offence, where such data are immediately relevant to and are included in ongoing investigations which Eurojust is coordinating or helping to coordinate and when their processing is necessary for the purposes specified in the regulation;
processing of operational data related to the investigation;
processing operational data other than the personal data referred to in Annex II relating to:
criminal investigations;
investigations;
criminal proceedings;
prosecutions;
immunity of individuals;
protection of the privacy of individuals’ personal data;
protecting the right of individuals to have their personal data processed and stored in a secure manner;
respect for the right to privacy of persons’ data and of the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned.
EU countries may, in exceptional cases, temporarily store and analyse each new temporary work file that contains personal data, subject to the purpose limitation principle applicable to processing of personal data in the context of all its activities. The national member may decide by way of derogation to store those data until the following review. It must inform the European Commission of any such decision. The Commission must inform Eurojust of the reasons for this decision and inform the national authorities of any new temporary storage.
A European Parliament and Council Standing Committee on the Protection of the Rights and Freedoms of Persons’ Personal Data, which meets regularly at Eurojust headquarters, has the power to adopt appropriate provisions that apply to all Eurojust staff and members of their families. The committee may adopt measures to protect the rights and liberties of individuals and to ensure Eurojust operates in line with the principles of privacy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It also adopts measures to ensure the confidentiality of national proceedings and decisions.
Amendments to the regulation
In 2018, the regulation was amended in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the College, the executive board and the administrative director. The College is the decision-making body responsible for the management of the Eurojust network. It is assisted by an Executive Director, who is appointed by Eurojust on the basis of a proposal from Eurojust. The executive board meets at at least twice a month and meets at the request of each Member State. It has a number of members, including the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (EPPO), the European Judicial Network and Eurojust Executive Director. It adopts the budget for the current financial year and the establishment plan for the following financial year.

Summary 51:
Criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering: rules for natural persons and entities responsible for money laundering (Directive (EU) 2015/849)
Criminal sanctions and rules for legal persons involved in money laundering
SUMMARY OF:
Directive 2014/40/EU on criminal offences and penalties in the field of money-laundering
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
   
 
It aims to combat money laundering by means of criminal law, enabling more efficient and swifter cross-border cooperation between EU countries’ competent authorities.
It establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences, penalties and sanctions for persons who commit, or were involved in, the criminal activity from which the property was derived.
KEY POINTS
EU countries must ensure that the conduct referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 is punishable as a criminal offence when committed by persons who are:
persons who committed, or who were involved, in criminal activities; or
natural persons acting as obliged entities in the exercise of their professional activities.
Penalties for individuals and entities are based on the following:
the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation within the meaning of Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA;
the offender is an obliged entity, or has committed the offence in the course of professional activities;
an obliged entity is liable for the benefit of that legal person under its authority.
Legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a legal person has made possible the commission of any of the offences referred to above.
The European Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of this directive by 3 December 2022 assessing the extent to which EU countries have taken the necessary measures to comply with this directive.
In criminal proceedings regarding money laundering, EU countries should assist each other in the widest possible way and ensure that information is exchanged in an effective and timely manner in accordance with national law and the existing EU legal framework. The freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime remove the financial incentives which drive crime.
Reporting
The Commission will submit to the EU Parliament and to the Council a report on its implementation and assess the extent of the measures taken by EU countries. The Commission will take into account the information provided by Member States.

Shipbuilding Injurious pricing: injurious pricing of ships
Shipbuilding injuriously priced ships
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 on the enforcement of the Shipbuilding Injunctive Pricing Code
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 385/96 on the protection against sales of ships below their normal value which cause injury.
It aims to ensure a fair comparison between the export price and the normal value of ships sold to a buyer of the exporting country.
KEY POINTS
Injunctive pricing:
a ship is considered as being injurious priced if:
the export price of the vessel sold is less than a comparable price for a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, when sold to buyers of the importing country;
the normal value is calculated on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits.
A shipbuilder is liable to be held liable for any damage caused by the sale of a vessel below its normal value.
The European Commission may initiate proceedings against a shipbuilder if it considers that further sales at less than normal value are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury will occur.
Complaints may be submitted by any natural or legal person, or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry. The complaint may also contain a request for a hearing by an interested party who is likely to be affected by the result of the proceedings and who has particular reasons why they should be heard.
Annex I to Annex II to the regulation lists the factors, including contractual penalties, which may affect prices and price comparability.
If the shipbuilder concerned does not pay the injurious price imposed under Article 7, countermeasures under the form of denial of loading and unloading rights shall be imposed by the Commission on the vessels built by that shipbuilder in question.
Implementation of the regulation
The Commission may decide to open an investigation or proceedings if it is satisfied that a member of the allegedly injured Union industry met the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 (d), to justify such proceedings. The investigation may be concluded no later than 1 year from the date of initiation. It may also be terminated without any further measures being taken.
Provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made based on the facts available.
In the event that any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide the necessary information within the time limits provided for in this regulation, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final conclusions may not be made.
Where measures are unnecessary, the proceedings may be terminated.

Economic support for the COVID-19 crisis: financial instruments
Economic support to the EU’s economic recovery
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — financial instruments for the economic recovery of the European Union (EU)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a financial instrument to support economic recovery in the EU in the wake of COVID (Coordinated intervention in the internal market for goods and services in response to the exceptional situation caused by COVID 19).
KEY POINTS
The COVID crisis has caused significant disturbances to economic activity which are reflected in a steep decline in gross domestic product (GDP) and a significant impact on employment, social conditions, poverty and inequalities. A sharp contraction of growth in the Union is foreseen for 2020.
To ensure a sustainable and resilient recovery throughout the EU and facilitate the implementation of economic support, the established mechanisms of spending through EU programmes under the multiannual financial framework are to be used.
The financial instruments to be financed under this regulation are:
non-repayable support, support through financial instruments or provisioning for budgetary guarantees and related expenditure by the EU;
investment in rural areas in addressing the impact of the crisis;
financial commitments giving rise to expenditure for support, technical and administrative assistance for implementation of the measures set out in the instrument;
the provision of budgetary guarantees up to an amount of € 384 400 million in 2018 prices.
Financing of the Instrument and allocation of funds
The instruments are financed on the basis of the empowerment provided for in Article 5 of the own resources decision of the EU Parliament and of the Council.
EU countries’ own resources are to use the financial instruments provided for by the Regulation on the financing of their own resources.
In view of the nature of the instruments, one part of the amounts available under the Instrument should be used for loans to EU countries, whereas the other part of these amounts should constitute external assigned revenue for the purpose of Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU), Euratom, 2018/946.
Implementation of the financial instrument
The measures to be implemented under the instrument are to:
recover the costs of the exceptional measures taken by EU countries to respond to COVID;
ensure that the measures are implemented in line with the principles of sound economic management;
support the efforts of the Commission and the Member States to implement the measures taken under this instrument.

The Commission may, on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances or following a reasoned request by the EU country concerned addressed to the Commission, recommend that the Council reduce the amount of the fine or cancel it. If the Council adopts a decision establishing that a Member State failed to take action in response to the Council recommendation, the Commission must, by a further decision, require the Member State in question to lodge with its interest-bearing deposits. The interest accrued thereon must be made up the shortfall when it lodges the deposit.
the Commission must:
make up the difference between the interest accrued and the amount lodged in accordance with Article 4 of the regulation;
ensure that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its investigations;
take appropriate measures to prevent the manipulation of statistics.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of:
detailed criteria for establishing the fine and for conducting the investigations,
the amount of fine and the associated procedures for the investigation, and

Bananas — EU-Central America agreement on the stabilisation mechanism for bananas (Regulation (EU) 2016/852)
Bananas – EU-Catchment Agreement
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EC) No 852/2012 on the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clause in the Agreement between the European Union and Central America on bananas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for implementing the agreement between the EU and the Central American countries of bananas.
It aims to prevent or remedy serious injury to the EU’s banana industry.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies only to products originating in the EU or in Central America. It does not apply to imports from non-EU countries.
Prior surveillance measures
In the event that there is an increase of imports concentrated in one or several of the EU's outermost regions or Member States, the Commission should be able to introduce prior surveillance measures. These measures must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
The Commission must:
impose provisional and definitive safeguard measures in the event of a threat of serious injury;
implement a prior surveillance procedure if there is sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of a product originating in a Central American country have increased as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty in accordance with the Tariff Elimination Schedule, and that such imports cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the Union industry;
suspend temporarily the preferential customs duty established under the stabilising mechanism.
Implementing measures
apply to every product which is put into free circulation after the date of entry into force of those measures.
apply provisional safeguard measures when there is a risk of serious damage to EU industry and there is evidence that the import of the product would cause damage which would be difficult to repair.
Provisional safeguard measures
The European Commission may adopt a provisional safeguard measure if:
there is sufficient evidence of a serious threat to the protection of EU industry caused by increased imports;
the imports are concentrated in an area where serious damage would be likely to be caused;
there are significant changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment of the sector concerned.
If the Commission considers that the conditions for imposing the safeguard measure are met, it may initiate a proceeding. The request to initiate proceedings must contain evidence that:
the import of a particular product is likely to cause serious damage,
the level of imports are likely to result in serious damage and that the industry is adjusting to the situation;
serious damage could be caused by:
changes in the share of the domestic market taken by the increased imports,
increased imports and changes in production and productivity,
change in the levels of sales and production productivity, productivity and losses of the sectors concerned, and
the number of workers employed.
A decision terminating the investigation and proceedings without measures
is adopted by the Commission on the basis of the examination procedure referred to in Article 116 of the agreement.
Stabilisation mechanism
A mechanism for stabilising imports of bananas is set up under the Agreement. It suspends temporarily any preferential customs duties that have been reduced or eliminated as a consequence of reductions or elimination under the tariff elimination schedule for bananas. The stabilisation measures are:
suspended temporarily if imports of the same product have increased due to a reduction in the customs duty or reduction in a customs rate;
temporarily suspended if imports have increased because of a change in the rate of production, production or productivity, or because of changes in employment.
FROM WHEN DOES THE LEGISLATION APPLY?
   
It has applied since 11 December 2012 and had to become law in the Member States by 11 December 2016.
BACKGROUND
 
The EU–Central America Agreement on bananas was signed on 29 June 2012.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 656/2014 — rules on border surveillance in the area of the Schengen acquis
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules on the application of the EU’s border surveillance rules.
It aims to ensure that border surveillance is not limited to the detection of attempts at illegal border crossings but equally extends to steps such as intercepting vessels suspected of trying to gain entry to the EU without submitting to border checks, as well as arrangements to address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during a border surveillance operation at sea and arrangements intended to bring such an operation to a successful conclusion.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all measures taken by EU countries or the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Eurojust) to prevent, detect or apprehend persons attempting to cross the borders of the European Union (EU).
It does not apply to:

The operational plan must contain details adapted to the circumstances of the sea operation concerned. It must be updated as necessary.
Participation in border surveillance operations
Member States and the Eurojust Agency must ensure that:
the operational plan is drawn up in accordance with the rules laid down in the regulation;

pregnant women or children on board;
victims of trafficking;
persons who have been reported missing or overdue;
people who have failed to make an expected position or safety report.
If a Member State suspects that a vessel is attempting to illegally cross its borders, it may approach the vessel and take measures to prevent it from crossing the border. If the flag State is unwilling or unable to do so either directly or with the assistance of the Member State to whom the participating unit belongs, that Member State may request authorisation from the EU country to take any of the measures laid down above.
Interception
Member countries and the Agency may:
intercept a vessel suspected of attempting to breach the border;
take measures against the vessel;
cooperate with the IMO and the ICJ in the event that the vessel is found to be in a state of uncertainty or in danger of being in danger;

Actions may not be transferred to other actions under the national programme.
Resources for eligible actions in the Member States
Resources are divided between the basic amount and an amount calculated on the basis of the average of 2011, 2012 and 2013 allocations for each in mind of the context in which they are used. The basic amount is composed of a minimum amount and a maximum amount. The maximum amount is based on the average number of applicants, beneficiaries and international protection transfers from one Member State to another and the number of cooperation projects with other Member States, in particular with regard to those most affected by migration and in particular those most in need of assistance.
National authorities must ensure that actions are carried out with the consent of the Member State which granted them international protection or is responsible for examining their application to another interested Member State where they will be granted international protection.
EU actions must be implemented according to the rules laid down in the regulation and must comply with the procedures laid down by the European Commission. The European Commission may, at its initiative, adopt measures to combat illegal immigration or the circumventing of existing legal migration rules, thereby safeguarding the integrity of Member States’ immigration systems. The Commission may also take measures to prevent illegal immigration and to combat the illegal immigration of non-EU nationals.
Implementation of the EFR
In order to achieve its objectives, the Fund supports the following actions:
the return of persons who have not been given international protection;
transnational actions and actions of transnational nature;
coordination of the actions of the national authorities;
reciprocal support for actions of regional and local authorities in order to ensure the proper functioning of the EU migration network;
participation of the Commission in the implementation of national actions;
cooperation with other EU bodies and programmes in the area of migration and migration policy;
support for the establishment, management and coordination of activities of national contact points;
assistance for the activities and activities of EMN;
financial support for the European migration network.

Controls on cash entering and leaving the EU
Countries must ensure that cash is declared to the competent authorities of the EU country through which they are entering or leaving the Union and make it available to them for control.
Categories of cash
The European Union (EU) has introduced a system of controls with respect to cash entering or departing the EU to complement the legal framework for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing laid down in Directive 2015/849.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out rules on the declaration of cash to the authorities of EU countries when it enters or leaves the EU.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
carriers who carry cash on their person, in their luggage or in their means of transport;
unaccompanied cash;
cash making up part of a consignment without a carrier;
criminal activity;
financial intelligence units (FIUs) established in an EU country for the purposes of implementing Article 32(2) of Directive (EU).
The EU’s financial intelligence unit (FIU) is the entity established in a Member State for the purpose of preventing money laundering or terrorist financing.
The obligation to declare cash must be subject to a threshold of €10 000 or more. Carriers must also declare amounts suspected to be related to criminal activity. In order not to restrict free movement unduly or overburden citizens and authorities with administrative formalities, the obligation should not exceed € 10 000.
In addition, it should also be possible to share information relating to sub-threshold amounts with the authorities in other Member States if there are indications of criminal activity, in other EU countries.
EU countries must:
ensure that the information obtained by the authorities is covered by the duty of professional secrecy;
make a disclosure declaration, systematically or on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with national procedures.
impose sanctions on persons who fail to comply with this obligation. These sanctions should include:
temporary detention of cash by competent authorities;

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the issuing and circulation of 2-euro coins and 2-centre commemorative coins to celebrate specific subjects.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all EU countries whose currency is the euro. It does not apply to:
non-euro countries that do not have a single currency;
euro countries which do not issue euro coins.
Issues of circulation coins
EU countries may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins. These coins are intended to commemorate a specific subject and comply with the denominations and technical specifications laid down in the regulation.
Collector coins are euro coins intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation. The regulation sets limits on the number of collector coins that can be issued per year and per issuing EU country.
The total number of coins put into circulation for each individual issue must not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0,1 % of the cumulated total net number of 2 euro coins put in circulation by all euro countries up to the beginning of the year preceding the regulation’s entry into force; and
0.1% of the total net numbers of 2 cent coins put on the market.
Commemorative coins
The Commission must establish certain volume limits for commemorative euro coins in order to ensure that such coins remain a minor percentage of the overall number of the 2-Euro coins in circulation.
In addition, the Commission must conduct an impact assessment on the continued issuance of 1-euro and 1-and-2-cent coins. This assessment must include a cost-benefit analysis which takes into account the real production costs of those coins set against their value and benefits. The Commission may decide whether to issue a common design collectively issued by all the euro countries. The decision whether to do so is taken by the Council of the European Union (EU).
In accordance with the regulation, coins denominated in euro and cent and complying with the denomination, technical specifications and the design laid down by the Commission have the status of legal tender in all EU Member States.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation No 551/2011/EC on statutory audit
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a procedure for the selection of statutory auditor or audit firm.
It sets out the principles of independence and professional secrecy for statutory audit firms.
KEY POINTS
The selection procedure is carried out by an audit committee composed of representatives of the European Parliament, the Council, the European Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
The committee is responsible for:
the selection of the statutory auditor;
the audit firm; and
the quality assurance, market monitoring, and transparency of the competent authorities.
The audit committee is chaired by a European Parliament and Council representative. The chair is elected for a 4-year term. The CEAOB is composed of a representative from each EU Member State and one representative from the European Economic and Social Committee of the Regions.
Auditors are appointed by the audit committee on the basis of a recommendation from the audit firm’s board of directors. The audit committee may make a recommendation to the auditor for an audit engagement. The recommendation must be justified and contain at least two choices for the audit engagement and the committee must express a duly justified preference for one of them. The committee may also express a preference for a third party if the audited entity were to enter into a contract with a non-audited entity or if the auditor was to perform audit work for an EU institution or entity with special relations with an EU country.
A sound engagement quality control review of the work carried out in each statutory audit engagement should be conducive to high audit quality. This review should be carried out every 2 years.
An audit report must be in clear and unambiguous language. It must be prepared by an independent audit firm and must contain the following information:
a description of the audit work;
a report on the overall results of the quality assurance system on an annual basis;
an audit report on any irregularities that may have occurred during the engagement;
any other information that may be relevant to the audit report.
In addition, the committee should:
identify any irregularities and take appropriate measures to deal with such irregularities and to prevent any recurrence of such irregularities;
ensure that the auditor and the auditor firm are informed of any threats to their independence and the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats;
make an annual report on their work on the quality of their work.
Quality assurance and transparency
Audits must comply with the following requirements:
they must be independent and transparent;
their work must be performed in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC;
they should be independent of any persons who work or who have worked for the bodies involved in the selection procedure.
If an audit firm is employed by a statutory auditor, the obligations under this regulation are incumbent on the auditor. The statutory auditor must ensure that its work complies with the requirements laid down by this regulation. The auditor must also ensure that their work is independent and that they are not involved in any conflicts of interest or conflicts of interests.
Regulatory cooperation between competent authorities
The regulation sets up the European European Auditors’ Association (EGAOB). It is the body responsible for the coordination of statutory audits and the establishment of supervisory convergence with non-EU countries. It is also responsible for establishing the European Supervisory Network of Auditors (ESNAA) and for the setting up of a European Audit Network of Supervisory Authorities (EASA). The EASA was established by Directive 2005/909/EC (see summary).
It is assisted by the European Financial Services Authority (EFSA), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EFSDA) and the Committee on Auditors and Supervising Auditors.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATING APPLY?

The ERDF’s goal is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
To achieve this goal, the ERDF aims to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the EU‘s cohesion policy priorities, and to the development of territorial cooperation not only in the areas covered by transnational cooperation programmes, but also in other areas such as maritime cooperation, interregional cooperation and maritime cooperation.
The regulation sets out:
the general principles of the ERD;
the specific objectives for territorial cooperation, i.e. to reduce disparities between regions, to improve the quality of life of the most disadvantaged regions and the most in need of assistance, particularly in rural areas;
transnational cooperation, which aims to enhance the integration of regions into the European Union (EU),
the development of regional cooperation in the field of territorial development,
the promotion of maritime cooperation and
the improvement of maritime relations between the EU countries and territories.
In addition, the regulation sets up a monitoring committee, composed of representatives of the participating EU countries, the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Fund (ESF).
The monitoring committee is responsible for:
monitoring the implementation of the programme;
assessing the progress made by the participating countries in the programme implementation;
checking that the programme is being implemented correctly;
ensuring that the expenditure is being reported to the lead beneficiary;
setting out the criteria for the selection of the lead beneficiaries;
establishing the monitoring committee and its responsibilities.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 on the European Union’s support programme for small and medium-sized islands
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European Union (EU) support programme to supply the smaller islands with agricultural products and to support local agricultural production.
It sets out detailed rules for the implementation of the programme.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all the islands except Crete and Evia.
The aim of the support programme is to:
support the development of agricultural production and local agricultural activities;
encourage farmers to supply quality products;
promote trade between the islands;
improve the marketing of quality agricultural products.
Measures to assist local production
The European Commission must adopt implementing acts to establish the measures supporting local production. These measures must be consistent with other EU policies and with the measures taken under such policies.
Specific supply arrangements are established for the EU's agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which are essential for human consumption, for the manufacture of other products or as agricultural inputs. These supply arrangements must be based on a forecast supply balance and must not lead to diversions of trade in the products concerned, nor should the economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements lead to diversion of trade.
In addition, the Commission must establish a register of operators and a system for the production of quality products. The Commission must also establish a system of checks to ensure that payments are made only on condition that they are actually passed on, and appropriate checks are carried out.
A derogation may be granted from the Commission's consistent policy of not authorising aid to the islands if the measures are not being carried out in line with the requirements of the islands and the strategy proposed. In such cases, Greece may submit to the Commission duly substantiated proposals for amendments to those measures within the context of the financial allocation referred to in Article 18(2) and (3) of the regulation.
Amendments to the regulation
The Commission may adopt amendments to the measures adopted under the regulation in respect of supplementing or modifying certain non-essential elements of this regulation. These amendments must be approved by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee (EEC).
The measures adopted by the Commission are subject to the same conditions as those laid down in the regulation on support for rural development by the EAFRD.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATING APPLY?
   
It has applied since 30 November 2009 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 November 2011.
BACKGROUND
 
The smaller islands constitute an essential tool for supplying those islands with goods and services and for supporting local agriculture.

Regulation (EC) No 788/96 on the statistical collection of statistics on the aquacultural sector
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the collection and analysis of statistics relating to the production (volume and unit value) of fish, crustaceans and molluscs (aquaculture) in European Union (EU) waters.
It repeals and repeals Regulation (EC), which had to become law in the EU countries by 2008.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to:
the annual production of fish and crustacean species* in EU waters;
the volume and unit values of molluses* and other aquatic animals (e.g. aquatic plants and fish);
the production of ornamental species* and ornamental aquatic animals;
aquaculture-related data on the production and use of aquacultures.
EU countries must submit the data to the European Commission (Eurostat) within 12 months of the end of the reference calendar year.
The data cover:
fishing areas for statistical purposes;
total production;
volume of fish;
unit values of crustacea;
number of species;
annual production of aquatic animals.
Annex V sets out methods for collecting the data.
National authorities must ensure that the data are collected in accordance with the rules laid down in the regulation.
Eurostat is assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics, which is composed of representatives of the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The Commission is assisted in its work by the standing committee for agricultural statistics and the Standing committee for fisheries statistics.
In addition, Eurostat must:
ensure that the Commission has access to the data;
assess the quality and relevance of the data collected;
make recommendations to the Commission on the quality, relevance, relevance and usefulness of the statistics collected.
Compilation of statistics
The European Commission must submit a report to Eurostat every 3 years on the data it has collected. The report must contain:
a description of the production, volume, unit value and year of the year;
an estimate of the number of species of fish caught, caught and released;
methods for collecting and processing the data, including methods of sampling, sampling and processing;
data on the structure of the aquaulture sector, including the number and stage of aquatic life cycle;
measures to be taken by the Commission to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information collected and to ensure that it is used for the purposes of the EU’s common fisheries policy.

Summary 175:
Convention on the rational conservation and management of fishery resources in the Area defined by the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Fishery Resources in the Convention Area (the Convention Area).
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 on the convention of the International Committee of the Red Sea — Convention on rational conservation, management and sustainable use of fisheries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that the convention’s rules are implemented.
The convention provides for an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation on the conservation and managed fishery resource in the area defined by it.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
fishing vessels flying the flag of a non-contracting party;
fishery resources frozen after being caught in the convention area;
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are involved in IUU activities.
EU countries must:
ensure that vessels flying their flag which fish or plan to fish in the regulation area are inspected before they enter their ports;
monitor the vessel monitoring system (VMS) and the identification of vessels that might be carrying out illicit fishing activities;
identify vessels that are carrying out illegal fishing activities and inform the European Commission and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of any such vessels.
National authorities must ensure that all vessels entering one of their ports are inspected.
Vessel monitoring system
Member States must ensure the automatic and electronic transmission to the NEAFC Secretary of information obtained by the VMS, including:
the name and registration number of the vessel;
the total round weight by species which are to be off-loaded or which have been on-loaded in kilograms and the call signs of the donor and receiving vessels. The Commission must forward the information promptly to the Secretary.
Monitoring and identifying of vessels
The VMS must be used to identify vessels that may be involved in illegal fishing. Member States must also designate and notify the IMO of ports where the landing or transhipment of illicit fishery products frozen after falling into the convention Area by fishing vessels of another contracting party are permitted.
Implementing measures
The European Union (EU) has adopted implementing measures. These include:
implementing rules for the monitoring of vessels flying its flag;
rules for the identification and tracking of vessels which are suspected of carrying out IUU fishing activities. These rules apply to vessels flying either the flag or the registration of a vessel.
Inspections and follow-up
The Commission must carry out inspections on board any fishing vessel without prior notice being transmitted by radio to that vessel or without that vessel being given the appropriate signal using the International Code of Signals, including the identity of the inspection platform. The inspection must be carried out under the authority of the flag EU country. If the vessel is found to be in breach of the rules, the vessel must be towed to a port designated by that EU country for a thorough inspection under its authority. The reasons for exceeding the limit laid down in paragraph 6 shall be recorded in the inspection report referred to in paragraph 9.
If serious infringements are found, the Commission may require the fishing vessel to proceed immediately, and in any case within 24 hours, to a designated port. The vessel must then be handed over to the competent authority for a further inspection.
Reports
Member countries must report to the Commission any information which might be relevant to the identification or tracking of IUU vessels. They must also submit to the body designated by it any further information which could be relevant for the verification of the conservation or management measures adopted by the convention. In addition to surveillance reports and information on inspections, Member States may at any time submit reports on any non-compliance with the convention or the rules.
FROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?

It has applied since 1 January 2010.
BACKGROUND
The Convention on Fisheries and Aquaculture (Convention Area) is a multilateral agreement which aims to conserve and manage fisheries in accordance with the principles set out in Article 1(2) of the Convention.
