 Regulation (EU) 2017/1725 on the export and import of accessible format copies of works and other subject matter
SUMMARY
Accessible format copies of books and other printed material which are protected by copyright and related rights are an essential means for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled to access culture and information. The Marrakesh Treaty, which the European Union ratified in 2014, provides for exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights for the making and dissemination of copies, in accessible formats, of certain works and other subject matter, and for the cross-border exchange of those copies. The Marrakesh Treaty also provides for exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights for the making and dissemination of copies, in accessible formats, of certain works and other subject matter, and for the cross-border exchange of those copies. This Regulation aims to ensure that accessible format copies of books, including e-books, journals, newspapers, magazines and other kinds of writing, notation, including sheet music, and other printed material, including in audio form, which have been made in any Member State in accordance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564 can be distributed, communicated, or made available, to a beneficiary person or authorised entity, as referred to in the Marrakesh Treaty, in third countries that are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty. Accessible formats include, for example, Braille, large print, adapted e-books, audio books and radio broadcasts.
KEY POINTS
What does the Regulation provide for?
An authorised entity established in a Member State may distribute, communicate or make available to beneficiary persons as one of its primary activities, institutional obligations or as part of its public-interest missions, an accessible format copy of a work or other subject matter made in accordance with the national legislation adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564.
A beneficiary person or an authorised entity established in a Member State may import or otherwise obtain or access and thereafter use, in accordance with the national legislation adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2017/1564, an accessible format copy of a work or other subject matter that has been distributed, communicated or made available to beneficiary persons or to authorised entities, by an authorised entity in a third country that is a party to the Marrakesh Treaty.
An authorised entity established in a Member State shall establish and follow the practices referred to in the first subparagraph in full respect of the rules applicable to the processing of personal data of beneficiary persons referred to in Article 6.
The processing of personal data carried out within the framework of this Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC.
The Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this Regulation by 11 October 2023, and present the main findings in a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee, accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for amending this Regulation.

Summary 133:
 rules on the issuance of euro coins
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1278/2012 on euro coins
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It introduces binding rules for the issuance of euro coins.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to all euro coins intended for circulation, which have the status of legal tender in all euro area Member States, and to collector coins, which have the status of legal tender only in the Member State of issuance.
Circulation coins
Circulation coins may be put into circulation at face value or above face value, but only if the special quality of the coin, the special packaging or any additional services provided justify the higher price.
The total number of circulation coins put into circulation for each individual issue may not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the total number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States;
1% of the total number of 1- and 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States.
Commemorative coins
Each euro area Member State may only issue 2 commemorative coins per year, except where:
commemorative coins are collectively issued by all euro area Member States; or
a commemorative coin is issued on the occasion of a temporary vacancy or a provisional occupation of the function of Head of State.
The total number of commemorative coins put into circulation for each individual issue may not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the total number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States;
1% of the total number of 1- and 2-euro coins put into circulation by all euro area Member States.
Collector coins
Collector coins may be put on the market at or above face value.
The issuances of collector coins are accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 1 January 2013.
BACKGROUND
              
The issuance of euro coins is currently governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 and Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98. However, the lack of mandatory provisions for the issuance of euro coins may result in different practices among euro area Member States and does not achieve a sufficiently integrated framework for the single currency.
The regulation is part of a package of measures to reform the monetary system of the European Union.
It introduces binding rules for the issuance of euro coins and sets limits on the issuance of commemorative coins and collector coins.

Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 — fixing multiannual financial assistance for the European territorial cohesion fund (2014-2020)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to establish the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the period 2014-2020.
KEY POINTS
The EMFF is part of the European Union’s (EU) cohesion policy. It is one of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) set up to reduce disparities between EU regions and improve the standard of living and employment prospects of EU citizens.
The EMFF supports the development of the EU’s maritime and fisheries sector and the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP).
The EMFF has 3 objectives:
to promote competitive, environmentally sustainable, economically viable and socially responsible fisheries and aquaculture;
to foster the implementation of the CFP;
to foster a balanced and inclusive territorial development of fisheries and aquaculture areas.
The EMFF is financed through the EU’s annual budget.
The EU’s financial assistance under the EMFF is disbursed in accordance with the principle of shared management. The EU and the EU countries jointly manage the EMFF. The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is €7.1 billion over the 2014-2020 period.
The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is subject to a performance-based management system, which is based on the results achieved in the fisheries sector and the maritime economy. The EU’s contribution to the EMFF is paid out in annual instalments. The Commission pays the EMFF to the EU countries which in turn pay the EMFF to the beneficiaries.
The EMFF supports the following measures:
competitiveness of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors;
fostering the implementation of the CFP;
sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture areas;
the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy;
the European Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.
The EU countries may decide to disburse the EMFF themselves, in accordance with the principle of shared management, or to manage it entirely themselves. The EU countries must submit operational programmes for the EMFF by 31 December 2014.
The EMFF supports the following measures:
competitiveness of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors;
fostering the implementation of the CFP;
sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture areas;

The SRM is a centralised system of resolution authorities that can resolve failing banks across the euro area. It is part of the banking union, which also includes the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
The SRM is designed to ensure that failing banks can be resolved in an orderly manner and without endangering the financial system. It can help to avoid the need for public money to be used to bail out failing banks and can help to protect taxpayers from the cost of bank failures.
The SRM includes a single resolution board (SRB) which can act to resolve failing banks and a single resolution fund (SRF) which can provide financial support to failing banks.
The SRM applies to banks in the euro area and to non-euro area countries that are part of the SSM.
The SRM is supported by the SRF, which is funded by contributions from banks in the euro area and in non-euro area countries that are part of the SSM. It is designed to ensure that the SRF can provide financial support to failing banks across the euro area.

Summary 149:
 rules for the internal gas market
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down basic principles and rules for access to and use of gas networks, including gas storage facilities and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, in order to ensure that the gas market operates in a fair, transparent and efficient manner.
It also establishes a European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) to promote the completion and functioning of the internal market in natural gas and cross-border trade, and to ensure the optimal management, coordinated operation and sound technical evolution of the natural gas transmission network.
KEY POINTS
The ENTSOG is composed of the national transmission system operators (TSOs) in the EU. It is responsible for developing and implementing network codes, non-binding ten-year network development plans and annual work programmes, and for coordinating and promoting regional cooperation structures.
TSOs are responsible for developing and implementing non-binding guidelines and harmonised contracts for the internal market in gas. They are also responsible for implementing the network codes and for providing network users with information on tariffs, capacity and physical status of the network.
TSOs must make available their transmission systems to all users on a non-discriminatory basis. They must develop and implement transparent and non-discriminatory balancing systems and transparent, non-discriminatory congestion-management procedures. They must also ensure the physical integrity of the gas transmission network.
TSOs must ensure the provision of third-party access services on the basis of harmonised transport contracts, which provide for the availability of short-term and long-term capacity, as well as for the possibility of reselling or subletting contracted capacity.
TSOs must provide network users with information on tariffs, capacity and physical status of the network. They must also provide network users with information on balancing, congestion-management and capacity-allocation mechanisms.
The Commission has adopted 6 network codes:
Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management
Security of Gas Supply
Guidelines for System Integrity and System Restoration
Guidelines for Harmonised Transmission Tariffs
Guidelines for Security of Supply and Integrity of Electricity Systems
Guidelines for Electricity Balancing.
FROM WHEN DO THE RULES APPLY?
The regulation applies from 3 May 2010.
BACKGROUND
The internal gas market is not yet fully integrated. The regulation seeks to further develop the internal gas market in order to ensure that it operates in a fair, transparent and efficient manner.
The regulation is one of the measures adopted by the EU to establish the single market for gas.
For more information, please see the European Commission’s website on the internal market for gas.
