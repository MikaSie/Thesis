Multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks
Multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/973 — establishing a multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, specifying details of the implementation of the landing obligation in the North Sea and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 676/2007 and (EC) No 1342/2008
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a multiannual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, and specifies details of the implementation of the landing obligation in the North Sea.
The plan aims to:
contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP), in particular by applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management;
ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY);
eliminate discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches;
implement the landing obligation established in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/201/3 for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which the regulation applies;
implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised;
ensure that the conditions described in descriptor 3 contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC are fulfilled;
contribute to the fulfilment of other relevant descriptors contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC in proportion to the role played by fisheries in their fulfilment.
KEY POINTS
The plan covers the following demersal stocks in the North Sea and their fisheries exploiting those stocks:
cod (Gadus morhua);
haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus);
plaice (Pleuronectes platessa);
saith (Pollachius virens);
sole (Solea solea);
whiting (Merlangius merlangus);
anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius);
Northern Prawn (Pandalus borealis);
Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus);
Norway lobster in the following functional units:
Botney Gut-Silver Pit (Functional Unit 5);
Farn Deeps (Functional Unit 6);
Fladen Ground (Functional Unit 7);
Firth of Forth (Functional Unit 8);
Moray Firth (Functional Unit 9);
Noup (Functional Unit 10);
Norwegian Deeps (Functional Unit 32);
Horn's Reef (Functional Unit 33);
Devil's Hole (Functional Unit 34).
The geographical scope of the plan is based on the geographical distribution of stocks indicated in the latest scientific stock advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). However, the Commission may adopt delegated acts to adjust the geographical distribution of stocks set out in the plan if the scientific advice provided by ICES indicates a change in the geographical distribution of the relevant stocks.
The plan also applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.
The plan specifies details for the implementation of the landing obligation in Union waters of the North Sea for all stocks of species to which the landing obligation applies under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The plan also applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.
The plan aims to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). It specifies that the target fishing mortality (F), in line with the ranges of FMSY defined in the plan, shall be achieved as soon as possible, and on a progressive, incremental basis by 2020 for the stocks listed in the plan, and shall be maintained thereafter within the ranges of FMSY.
The plan also aims to ensure that the conditions described in descriptor 3 contained in Annex I to Directive 2008/56/EC are fulfilled and to contribute to the fulfilment of other relevant descriptors contained in Annex I to Directive 2002008/56/EC in proportion to the role played by fisheries in their fulfilment.
The plan aims to eliminate discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to implement the landing obligation established in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which the regulation applies.
The plan implements the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised. It shall be coherent with Union environmental legislation, in particular with the objective of achieving good environmental status by 2020 as set out in Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC.
The plan specifies details for the implementation of the landing obligation in Union waters of the North Sea for all stocks of species to which the landing obligation applies under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
The plan applies to by-catches caught in the North Sea when fishing for the stocks listed above.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/975 — laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention Area.
The regulation aims to ensure that the conservation and management measures adopted by the SPRFMO (‘SPRFMO conservation and management measures’) are fully transposed into EU law and are, therefore, uniformly and effectively implemented within the EU.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to:
the EU fishing vessels operating in the SPRFMO Convention Area;
the EU fishing vessels transhipping fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area;
third country fishing vessels upon requesting access to, or being the object of an inspection in, EU ports and carrying fishery products harvested in the SPRFMO Convention Area.
The regulation defines the following:
‘SPRFMO Convention Area’: the geographical area marked out in Article 5 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (‘the SPRFMO Convention’);
‘fishing vessel’: any vessel of any size used or intended for use for the purposes of commercial exploitation of fishery resources, including support ships, fish processing vessels, vessels engaged in transhipment and carrier vessels equipped for the transportation of fishery products, except container vessels;
‘Union fishing vessel’: a fishing vessel flying the flag of an EU Member State and registered in the EU;
‘SPRFMO fishery resources’: all marine biological resources within the SPRFMO Convention Area excluding:
sedentary species in so far as they are subject to the national jurisdiction of coastal States pursuant to Article 77, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (‘UNCLOS’);
highly migratory species listed in Annex I to UNCLOS;
anadromous and catadromous species;
marine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds;
‘SPRFMO fishery products’: aquatic organisms, or products derived therefrom, resulting from any fishing activity within the SPRFMO Convention Area;
‘fishing activity’: searching for fish, shooting, setting, towing, hauling of a fishing gear, taking catch on board, transhipping, retaining on board, processing on board, transferring and landing of fish and fishery products;
‘bottom fishing’: the fishing by any fishing vessel using any gear which is likely to come in contact with the seafloor or benthic organisms during the normal course of operations;
‘bottom fishing footprint’: the spatial extent of bottom fishing in the SPRFMO Convention Area during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006;
‘IUU fishing’: any illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing activities as defined in points 1 to 4 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008;
‘draft SPRFMO IUU vessel list’: the initial list of fishing vessels presumed to have undertaken IUU fishing, as drafted by the SPRFMO Secretariat and submitted to the SPRFMO Compliance and Technical Committee for consideration;
‘exploratory fishery’: a fishery that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique in the previous 10 years;
‘large-scale pelagic driftnet’: a gillnet or other net, or a combination of nets, which is more than 2,5 kilometres in length the purpose of which is to enmesh, entrap or entangle fish by drifting on the surface or in the water;
‘deepwater gillnets’: e.g. trammel nets, set nets, anchored nets, sink nets, means strings of single, double or triple netting walls, held vertically, on or near the bottom, in which fish will gill, entangle or enmesh. Deepwater gillnets consist of single or, less commonly, double or triple netting mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear. Those nets can be used either alone or, as is more usual, in large numbers placed in line (‘fleets’ of nets). The gear can be set, anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected with the vessel;
‘SPRFMO Cooperating Non-Contracting Party’: (CNCP) a State or fishing entity that it is not a party to the SPRFMO Convention but has agreed to fully cooperate in the implementation of the SPRFMO conservation and management measures;
‘SPRFMO record of vessels’: the list of fishing vessels authorised to fish in the SPRFMO Convention Area, as notified by the Contracting Parties and CNCPs, which is maintained by the SPRFMO Secretariat;
‘transhipment’: the unloading of all or any fishery products on board a fishing vessel to another fishing vessel;
‘other species of concern’: species listed in Annex XIII;
‘vulnerable marine ecosystem’: (VME) any marine ecosystem the integrity (i.e. ecosystem structure or function) of which is, according to the best scientific information available and to the precautionary principle, threatened by significant adverse impacts resulting from physical contact with bottom gears in the normal course of fishing operations, including reefs, seamounts, hydrothermal vents, cold water corals or cold water sponge beds.
The regulation lays down management, conservation and control measures concerning certain species and certain fishing methods.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It introduces a system of controls on cash entering or leaving the EU to complement the legal framework for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing established under Directive (EU) 2015/849.
KEY POINTS
The regulation provides for a system of controls on cash entering or leaving the EU to complement the legal framework for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing established under Directive (EU) 2015/849.
Cash
The regulation defines ‘cash’ as:
currency;
bearer-negotiable instruments;
commodities used as highly-liquid stores of value;
prepaid cards.
Obligation to declare accompanied cash
Carriers who carry cash of a value of EUR 10 000 or more shall declare that cash to the competent authorities of the Member State through which they are entering or leaving the Union and make it available to them for control.
The declaration shall provide details about the following:
the carrier;
the owner of the cash;
where available, the intended recipient of the cash;
the nature and the amount or value of the cash;
the economic provenance of the cash;
the intended use of the cash;
the transport route;
the means of transport.
The details shall be provided in writing or electronically, using the declaration form referred to in the regulation.
Obligation to disclose unaccompanied cash
Where unaccompanied cash of a value of EUR 10 000 or more is entering or leaving the Union, the competent authorities of the Member State through which the cash is entering or leaving the Union may require the sender or the recipient of the cash, or a representative thereof, as the case may be, to make a disclosure declaration within a deadline of 30 days. The competent authorities may detain the cash until the sender or the recipient, or a representative thereof, makes the disclosure declaration.
The disclosure declaration shall provide details about the following:
the declarant;
the owner of the cash;
the sender of the cash;
the recipient or intended recipient of the cash;
the nature and the amount or value of the cash;
the economic provenance of the cash;
the intended use of the cash;
the transport route;
the means of transport.
The details shall be provided in writing or electronically, using the declaration form referred to in the regulation.
Detention of cash
The competent authorities may detain cash temporarily in certain circumstances, subject to checks and balances: first, where the obligation to declare or to disclose cash has not been met and, second, where there are indications of criminal activity, irrespective of the amount or whether the cash is accompanied or unaccompanied.
The period of detention of the cash may be extended in specific and duly assessed cases, for instance when competent authorities encounter difficulties in obtaining information on a potential criminal activity, inter alia, when communication with a third country is required, when documents have to be translated or when it is difficult to identify and contact the sender or the recipient in the case of unaccompanied cash.
If, at the end of the period of detention, no decision concerning further intervention is taken or if the competent authority decides that there are no grounds to further detain the cash, it should immediately be released, depending on the situation, to the person from whom the cash was temporarily detained, the carrier or the owner.
Exchange of information
The competent authorities of a Member State may exchange information with the authorities of a third country provided that there are appropriate safeguards. Such exchange should only be permissible where relevant national and Union provisions on fundamental rights and the transfer of personal data are complied with, following authorisation by the authorities which originally obtained the information.
The Commission should be informed of any occurrence of information exchange with third countries pursuant to this Regulation and should report thereon to the European Parliament and to the Council.

Persistent organic pollutants
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 — persistent organic pollutants
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs), by prohibiting, phasing out as soon as possible, or restricting the manufacturing, placing on the market and use of substances subject to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Convention) and the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Protocol).
It also aims to minimise, with a view to eliminating where feasible as soon as possible, releases of such substances, and to establish provisions regarding waste consisting of, containing or contaminated by any of those substances.
KEY POINTS
Manufacturing, placing on the market and use of substances
The manufacturing, placing on the market and use of substances listed in Annex I are prohibited.
The manufacturing, placing on the market and use of substances listed in Annex II are restricted.
Waste management
Waste containing or contaminated by any substance listed in Annex IV shall be disposed of or recovered, without undue delay and in accordance with Part 1 of Annex V to the regulation, in such a way as to ensure that the POP content is destroyed or irreversibly transformed so that the remaining waste and releases do not exhibit the characteristics of POPs.
By way of derogation from the above, waste containing or contaminated by any substance listed in Annex IV may be otherwise disposed of or recovered in accordance with the relevant EU legislation, provided that the content of the listed substances in the waste is below the concentration limits specified in Annex IV.
A Member State or the competent authority designated by that Member State may, in exceptional cases, allow wastes listed in Part 2 of Annex V containing or contaminated by a substance listed in Annex IV up to concentration limits specified in Part 2 of Annex V to be otherwise dealt with in accordance with a method listed in Part 2 of Annex V, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:
the holder concerned has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority of the Member State concerned that decontamination of the waste in relation to substances listed in Annex IV was not feasible, and that destruction or irreversible transformation of the POP content, performed in accordance with best environmental practice or best available techniques, does not represent the environmentally preferable option;
the holder concerned has provided information on the POP content of the waste to the competent authority;
the operation is in accordance with relevant EU legislation and with the conditions laid down in relevant additional measures referred to in Article 7(5) of the regulation;
the Member State concerned has informed the other Member States, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Commission of its authorisation and the justification for it.
Stockpiles
The holder of a stockpile, which consists of or contains any substance listed in Annex I or II, for which no use is permitted, shall manage that stockpile as waste and in accordance with Article 7.
The holder of a stockpile greater than 50 kg, consisting of or containing any substance listed in Annex I or II, and the use of which is permitted shall provide the competent authority of the Member State in which the stockpile is established with information concerning the nature and size of that stockpile. Such information shall be provided within 12 months of the date that this regulation or Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 became applicable to that substance, whichever date came first for the holder, and of relevant amendments to Annex I or II and annually thereafter until the deadline specified in Annex I or II for restricted use.
The holder shall manage the stockpile in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound manner, in accordance with the thresholds and requirements laid down in Directive 2012/18/EU and taking all adequate steps to ensure that the stockpile is managed in a manner that will protect human health and the environment.
Release reduction, minimisation and elimination
Member States shall draw up inventories for the substances listed in Annex III released into air, water and land in accordance with their obligations under the Convention and the Protocol and shall subsequently maintain such inventories.
Member States shall communicate their action plans on measures to identify, characterise and minimise, with a view to eliminating where feasible as soon as possible, the total releases of substances listed in Annex III as recorded in their inventories drawn up in accordance with their obligations under the Convention, to the Commission, the Agency and to the other Member States as part of their national implementation plans, pursuant to Article 9.
Such action plans shall include measures to promote the development of, and, where it is considered appropriate, shall require the use of substitute or modified substances, mixtures, articles and processes to prevent the formation and release of substances listed in Annex III.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 16 July 2019.

It is managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), which is an independent agency.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It codifies Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 which established the EUTM system.
KEY POINTS
The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) manages the EUTM system.
The EUTM is a registered trade mark that covers the whole of the EU and is valid in all the EU Member States. It is a legal right that protects goods and services from unauthorised imitation or infringement.
An EUTM may consist of any sign, including words, designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of their packaging or sounds, provided that such signs are capable of:
distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings; and
being represented on the register in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.
The proprietor of an EUTM is any natural or legal person, including authorities established under public law.
An EUTM shall be obtained by registration.
The following shall not be registered:
signs which do not conform to the requirements of Article 4;
trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;
trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods or service;
signs which consist exclusively of:
the shape, or another characteristic, which results from the nature of the goods themselves;
the shape, or another characteristic, of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result;
the shape, or another characteristic, which gives substantial value to the goods;
trade marks which are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality;
trade marks which are of such a nature as to deceive the public, for instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or service;
trade marks which have not been authorised by the competent authorities and are to be refused pursuant to Article 6ter of the Paris Convention;
trade marks which include badges, emblems or escutcheons other than those covered by Article 6ter of the Paris Convention and which are of particular public interest, unless the consent of the competent authority to their registration has been given;
trade marks which are excluded from registration, pursuant to Union legislation or national law or to international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is party, providing for protection of designations of origin and geographical indications;
trade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional terms for wine;
trade marks which are excluded from registration pursuant to Union legislation or international agreements to which the Union is party, providing for protection of traditional specialities guaranteed;
trade marks which consist of, or reproduce in their essential elements, an earlier plant variety denomination registered in accordance with Union legislation or national law, or international agreements to which the Union or the Member State concerned is a party, providing for protection of plant variety rights, and which are in respect of plant varieties of the same or closely related species.
The EUTM shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the EU: it shall not be registered, transferred or surrendered or be the subject of a decision revoking the rights of the proprietor or declaring it invalid, nor shall its use be prohibited, save in respect of the whole EU.
The EUTM system is managed by the EUIPO, which is an independent agency.

 Food labelling: rules to help consumers make better-informed choices
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It sets out the rules for the provision of food information to consumers in the EU, in particular the labelling of food products.
It replaces the legislation on food labelling (Directive 2000/13/EC) and nutrition labelling (Directive 90/496/EC).
It also repeals other legislation on food labelling, including those on the indication of alcoholic strength by volume (Directive 87/250/EEC), the labelling of certain foodstuffs (Directive 1999/10/EC), the labelling of foodstuffs containing quinine and caffeine (Directive 2002/67/EC), the labelling of foods and food ingredients with added phytosterols and phytosterol esters (Regulation (EC) No 608/2004), and the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 2000/13/EC (Directive 2008/5/EC).
KEY POINTS
The regulation provides a basis for consumers to make informed choices in relation to the food they eat and to prevent any practices that may mislead the consumer.
It establishes the general principles, requirements and responsibilities governing food information, and in particular food labelling.
It lays down the means to guarantee the right of consumers to information and procedures for the provision of food information, taking into account the need to provide sufficient flexibility to respond to future developments and new information requirements.
It applies to food business operators at all stages of the food chain, where their activities concern the provision of food information to consumers. It applies to all foods intended for the final consumer, including foods delivered by mass caterers, and foods intended for supply to mass caterers.
It applies without prejudice to labelling requirements provided for in specific EU provisions applicable to particular foods.
KEY WORDS
Labelling, food labelling, food information, nutrition labelling, country of origin.

 Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 on the issuance of euro coins
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the issuance of euro coins
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules on the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation and for collection.
KEY POINTS
Circulation coins
Circulation coins are euro coins intended for circulation, the denominations and technical specifications of which are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98.
Member States may issue two types of euro coin: circulation coins and collector coins.
Circulation coins may be put into circulation at face value or at a price higher than face value. However, a maximum of 5% of the total net value of the circulation coins issued by a Member State may be put on the market above face value. This is subject to the following:
the special quality of the coin;
the special packaging;
any additional services provided.
Commemorative coins
Each Member State whose currency is the euro may only issue 2 commemorative coins per year, save where:
commemorative coins are collectively issued by all Member States whose currency is the euro; or
a commemorative coin is issued on the occasion of a temporary vacancy or a provisional occupation of the function of Head of State.
The total number of commemorative coins put into circulation for each individual issue shall not exceed the higher of the following two ceilings:
0.1% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by all Member States whose currency is the euro up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin; this ceiling may be raised to 2,0% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins of all Member States whose currency is the euro if a widely recognised and highly symbolic subject is commemorated, in which case the issuing Member State shall refrain from launching another commemorative coin issue using the raised ceiling during the subsequent four years and shall set out the reasons for choosing the raised ceiling; or
5.0% of the cumulated total net number of 2-euro coins put into circulation by the Member State concerned up to the beginning of the year preceding the year of issuance of the commemorative coin.
Collector coins
Collector coins are euro coins intended for collection that are not issued with a view to their entry into circulation.
Collector coins may be put on the market at or above face value.
The issuances of collector coins shall be accounted for on an aggregated basis in the volume of coin issuance to be approved by the European Central Bank.
Member States shall take all appropriate measures to discourage the use of collector coins as a means of payment.
Consultation prior to the destruction of circulation coins
Prior to the destruction of circulation coins which are not euro coins unfit for circulation within the meaning of point (b) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1210/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2010 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation, Member States shall consult each other via the relevant subcommittee of the Economic and Financial Committee and inform the mint directors of the Member States whose currency is the euro.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 24 August 2012.
BACKGROUND
              
The Council conclusions of 23 November 1998 and of 5 November 2002 on euro coins intended for collection, the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC of 19 December 2008 on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation (endorsed by Council conclusions of 10 February 2009), and the Commission Recommendation 2010/191/EU of 22 March 2010 on the scope and effects of legal tender of euro banknotes and coins recommend practices regarding the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation, including commemorative euro coins, consultation prior to the destruction of fit euro circulation coins and the use of euro collector coins.

Textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of the fibre composition of textile products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 — on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of the fibre composition of textile products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules concerning the use of textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of fibre composition of textile products, rules concerning the labelling or marking of textile products containing non-textile parts of animal origin and rules concerning the determination of the fibre composition of textile products by quantitative analysis of binary and ternary textile fibre mixtures.
It aims to improve the functioning of the internal market and to provide accurate information to consumers.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to textile products when they are made available on the EU market and to products referred to in its Article 2(2).
Products referred to in Article 2(2) include:
products containing at least 80 % by weight of textile fibres;
furniture, umbrella and sunshade coverings containing at least 80 % by weight of textile components;
the textile components of:
upper layers of multi-layer floor coverings;
mattress coverings;
coverings of camping goods;
provided such textile components constitute at least 80 % by weight of such upper layers or coverings.
Textile products which are contracted out to persons working in their own homes or to independent firms that carry out work from materials supplied without the property therein being transferred for consideration, and customised textile products made up by self-employed tailors, are not covered by the regulation.
Definitions
For the purposes of the regulation, the following definitions apply:
textile product: any raw, semi-worked, worked, semi-manufactured, manufactured, semi-made-up or made-up product which is exclusively composed of textile fibres, regardless of the mixing or assembly process employed;
textile fibre: either of the following:
a unit of matter characterised by its flexibility, fineness and high ratio of length to maximum transverse dimension, which render it suitable for textile applications;
a flexible strip or tube, of which the apparent width does not exceed 5 mm, including strips cut from wider strips or films, produced from the substances used for the manufacture of the fibres listed in Table 2 of Annex I and suitable for textile applications;
apparent width: the width of the strip or tube when folded, flattened, compressed or twisted, or the average width where the width is not uniform;
textile component: a part of a textile product with an identifiable fibre content;
extraneous fibres: fibres other than those stated on the label or marking;
lining: a separate component used in making up garments and other products, consisting of a single layer or multiple layers of textile material held in place along one or more of the edges;
labelling: affixing the required information to the textile product by way of attaching a label;
marking: indicating the required information directly on the textile product by way of sewing, embroidering, printing, embossing or any other technology of application;
inclusive labelling: the use of a single label for several textile products or components;
disposable product: a textile product designed to be used only once or for a limited time, and the normal use of which is not intended for subsequent use for the same or a similar purpose;
agreed allowance: the value of moisture regain to be used in the calculation of the percentage of fibre components on a clean, dry mass basis, with adjustment by conventional factors.
Textile fibre names and related labelling and marking requirements
Only the textile fibre names listed in Annex I may be used for the description of fibre compositions on labels and markings of textile products.
The names listed in Annex I may be used for textile fibres the nature of which corresponds to the description set out in that Annex.
The names listed in Annex I may not be used for other fibres, whether on their own or as a root or as an adjective.
The term ‘silk’ may not be used to indicate the shape or particular presentation in continuous filament yarn of textile fibres.
Applications for new textile fibre names
Any manufacturer or any person acting on a manufacturer's behalf may apply to the European Commission to add a new textile fibre name to the list set out in Annex I.
The application shall include a technical file compiled in accordance with Annex II.
Pure textile products
Only textile products exclusively composed of the same fibre may be labelled or marked as ‘100 %’, ‘pure’ or ‘all’.
Those or similar terms may not be used for other textile products.
A textile product containing no more than 2 % by weight of extraneous fibres may also be treated as exclusively composed of the same fibre, provided this quantity is justified as being technically unavoidable in good manufacturing practice and is not added as a matter of routine.
Fleece wool or virgin wool products
A textile product may be labelled or marked by one of the names set out in Annex III provided it is composed exclusively of a wool fibre which has not previously been incorporated in a finished product, which has not been subjected to any spinning and/or felting processes other than those required in the manufacture of that product, and which has not been damaged by treatment or use.
By way of derogation from the first paragraph, the names listed in Annex III may be used to describe wool contained in a textile fibre mixture if all the following conditions are met:
all the wool contained in that mixture satisfies the requirements defined in the first paragraph;
such wool accounts for not less than 25 % of the total weight of the mixture;
in the case of a scribbled mixture, the wool is mixed with only one other fibre.
The full percentage composition of such mixture must be given.

 EU rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at airports
EU rules on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at airports
SUMMARY
The European Union (EU) wants to reduce aircraft noise around its airports. The European Parliament and the Council have therefore adopted Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach.
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives at the level of individual airports, while respecting relevant EU rules, in particular those laid down in Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise and the legislation within each EU Member State.
It also enables the use of operating restrictions in accordance with the Balanced Approach so as to achieve the sustainable development of the airport and air traffic management network capacity from a gate-to-gate perspective.
KEY POINTS
The regulation applies to aircraft engaged in civil aviation. It does not apply to aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar operations.
Member States must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for the process to be followed when adopting operating restrictions.
The competent authorities must be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.
The Member States must notify the European Commission, in a timely manner, of the names and addresses of the designated competent authorities.
The Member States must ensure the right to appeal against operating restrictions adopted pursuant to this Regulation before an appeal body other than the authority that adopted the contested restriction, in accordance with national legislation and procedures.
The Member States must ensure that the noise situation at an individual airport is assessed on a regular basis, in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC and the legislation applicable within each Member State.
The competent authorities must ensure that the noise situation at airports for which they are responsible is assessed on a regular basis, in accordance with Directive 2002/49/EC and the legislation applicable within each Member State.
If the assessment referred to in the previous paragraph indicates that new operating restriction measures may be required to address a noise problem at an airport, the competent authorities must ensure that:
the method, indicators and information in Annex I are applied in such a way as to take due account of the contribution of each type of measure under the Balanced Approach, before operating restrictions are introduced;
at the appropriate level, technical cooperation is established between the airport operators, aircraft operators and air navigation service providers to examine measures to mitigate noise. The competent authorities must also ensure that local residents, or their representatives, and relevant local authorities are consulted, and that technical information on noise mitigation measures is provided to them;
the cost-effectiveness of any new operating restriction is assessed, in accordance with Annex II. Minor technical amendments to measures without substantive implications on capacity or operations shall not be considered new operating restrictions;
the process of consultation with interested parties, which may take the form of a mediation process, is organised in a timely and substantive manner, ensuring openness and transparency as regards data and computation methodologies. Interested parties must have at least 3 months prior to the adoption of the new operating restrictions to submit comments. The interested parties must include at least:
local residents living in the vicinity of the airport and affected by air traffic noise, or their representatives, and the relevant local authorities;
representatives of local businesses based in the vicinity of the airport, whose activities are affected by air traffic and the operation of the airport;
relevant airport operators;
representatives of those aircraft operators which may be affected by noise-related actions;
the relevant air navigation service providers;
where applicable, the designated slots coordinator.
The competent authorities must follow up and monitor the implementation of the operating restrictions and take action as appropriate. They must ensure that relevant information is made available free of charge and that it is readily and promptly accessible to local residents living in the vicinity of the airports and to the relevant local authorities.
The relevant information may include:
while respecting national law, information on alleged infringements due to changes in flight procedures, in terms of their impact and the reasons why such changes were made;
the general criteria applied when distributing and managing traffic in each airport, to the extent that those criteria may have an environmental or noise impact; and
data collected by noise measuring systems, if available.
Decisions on noise-related operating restrictions must be based on the noise performance of the aircraft as determined by the certification procedure conducted in accordance with Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention, sixth edition of March 2011.
The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 12 of the regulation concerning:
technical updates to the noise certification standards provided for in Article 5(5) and point (a) of Article 9(1), and to the certification procedure provided for in Article 7(1);
technical updates to the methodology and indicators set out in Annex I.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 13 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
              
The European Union (EU) wants to reduce aircraft noise around its airports. The European Parliament and the Council have therefore adopted Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a Balanced Approach.
For more information, please see:
Noise at airports (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Aircraft. Fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass of 34 000 kg or with a certificated maximum internal accommodation for the aircraft type in question consisting of 19 passenger seats or more, excluding any seats for crew only.
Airport. An airport which has more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per calendar year (a movement being a take-off or landing), on the basis of the average number of movements in the last three calendar years before the noise assessment.
Balanced Approach. The process developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization under which the range of available measures, namely the reduction of aircraft noise at source, land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions, is considered in a consistent way with a view to addressing the noise problem in the most cost-effective way on an airport-by-airport basis.
Noise-related action. Any measure that affects the noise climate around airports, for which the principles of the Balanced Approach apply, including other non-operational actions that can affect the number of people significantly affected by potentially harmful effects of aircraft noise.
Operating restriction. A noise-related action that limits access to or reduces the operational capacity of an airport, including operating restrictions aimed at the withdrawal from operations of marginally compliant aircraft at specific airports as well as operating restrictions of a partial nature, which for example apply for an identified period of time during the day or only for certain runways at the airport.

 European rail network for competitive freight
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 — concerning a European rail network for competitive freight
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European rail network for competitive freight (ERRCF) to increase the efficiency of rail freight transport.
KEY POINTS
The regulation lays down rules for the establishment and organisation of international rail corridors for competitive rail freight with a view to the development of a European rail network for competitive freight.
It sets out rules for the selection, organisation, management and the indicative investment planning of freight corridors.
The regulation applies to the management and use of railway infrastructure included in freight corridors.
The regulation defines ‘freight corridor’ as all designated railway lines, including railway ferry lines, on the territory of or between Member States, and, where appropriate, European third countries, linking two or more terminals, along a principal route and, where appropriate, diversionary routes and sections connecting them, including the railway infrastructure and its equipment and relevant rail services in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2001/14/EC.
The regulation defines ‘implementation plan’ as the document presenting the means and the strategy that the parties concerned intend to implement in order to develop over a specified period the measures which are necessary and sufficient to establish the freight corridor.
The regulation defines ‘terminal’ as the installation provided along the freight corridor which has been specially arranged to allow either the loading and/or the unloading of goods onto/from freight trains, and the integration of rail freight services with road, maritime, river and air services, and either the forming or modification of the composition of freight trains; and, where necessary, performing border procedures at borders with European third countries.
Designation of initial freight corridors
The Member States referred to in the Annex shall make operational by the dates set out therein the initial freight corridors set out in the Annex. The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission about the establishment of the freight corridors.
Selection of further freight corridors
Each Member State with a rail border with another Member State shall participate in the establishment of at least one freight corridor, unless this obligation has already been met under the initial freight corridors.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States shall, upon request from a Member State, participate in the establishment of the freight corridor as referred to in that paragraph or the prolongation of an existing corridor, in order to allow a neighbouring Member State to fulfil its obligation under that paragraph.
Where a Member State considers, after having provided a socio-economic analysis, that the establishment of a freight corridor would not be in the interest of the applicants likely to use the freight corridor or would not bring significant socio-economic benefits or would cause a disproportionate burden, the Member State concerned shall not be obliged to participate as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, subject to a decision of the Commission acting in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 21(2).
A Member State shall not be obliged to participate as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 if it has a rail network which has a track gauge which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union.
The establishment of a freight corridor shall be proposed by the Member States concerned. For this purpose they shall send jointly to the Commission a letter of intent including a proposal drawn up after consultation of the infrastructure managers and applicants concerned, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4.
The Commission shall examine the proposals for the establishment of a freight corridor as referred to in paragraph 5 and, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 21(3), adopt a decision on the compliance of such a proposal with this Article at the latest 9 months after submission of the proposal.
The Member States concerned shall establish the freight corridor at the latest two years after the decision of the Commission referred to in paragraph 6.
Governance of freight corridors
For each freight corridor, Member States concerned shall establish an executive board responsible for defining the general objectives of the freight corridor, supervising and taking the measures as expressly provided for in paragraph 7 of this Article, and in Articles 9 and 11, Article 14(1) and Article 22. The executive board shall be composed of representatives of the authorities of the Member States concerned.
For each freight corridor, the infrastructure managers concerned and, where relevant, the allocation bodies as referred to in Article 14(2) of Directive 2001/14/EC, shall establish a management board responsible for taking the measures as expressly provided for in paragraphs 5, 7, 8 and 9 of this Article, and in Articles 9 to 12, Article 13(1), Article 14(2), (6) and (9), Article 16(1), Article 17(1) and Articles 18 and 19 of this Regulation. The management board shall be composed of the representatives of the infrastructure managers.
The Member States and infrastructure managers concerned by a freight corridor shall cooperate within the boards referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to ensure the development of the freight corridor in accordance with its implementation plan.
The executive board shall take its decisions on the basis of mutual consent of the representatives of the authorities of the Member States concerned.
The management board shall take its decisions, including decisions regarding its legal status, the establishment of its organisational structure, resources and staffing, on the basis of mutual consent of the infrastructure managers concerned. The management board may be an independent legal entity. It may take the form of a European economic interest grouping within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2137/85 of 25 July 1985 on the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG).
The responsibilities of the executive and management boards shall be without prejudice to the independence of infrastructure managers as provided for in Article 4(2) of Directive 91/440/EEC.
The management board shall set up an advisory group made up of managers and owners of the terminals of the freight corridor including, where necessary, sea and inland waterway ports. This advisory group may issue an opinion on any proposal by the management board which has direct consequences for investment and the management of terminals. It may also issue own-initiative opinions. The management board shall take any of these opinions into account. In the event of disagreement between the management board and the advisory group, the latter may refer the matter to the executive board. The executive board shall act as an intermediary and provide its opinion in due time. The final decision however shall be taken by the management board.
The management board shall set up a further advisory group made up of railway undertakings interested in the use of the freight corridor. This advisory group may issue an opinion on any proposal by the management board which has consequences for these undertakings. It may also issue own-initiative opinions. The management board shall take any of these opinions into account.
The management board shall coordinate in accordance with national and European deployment plans the use of interoperable IT applications or alternative solutions that may become available in the future to handle requests for international train paths and the operation of international traffic on the freight corridor.
Investment in the freight corridor
The management board shall draw up and periodically review an investment plan, which includes details of indicative medium and long-term investment for infrastructure in the freight corridor, and shall submit it for approval to the executive board. This plan

Summary 148:
 hydrogen-powered vehicles
HYDROGEN-POWERED VEHICLES
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes rules for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered vehicles, hydrogen components and hydrogen systems.
It establishes requirements for the installation of hydrogen components and systems.
It lays down penalties for non-compliance with the rules.
KEY POINTS
Hydrogen is considered to be a clean way of powering vehicles for the future, as vehicles propelled with hydrogen emit neither carbon-based pollutants nor greenhouse gases. However, hydrogen-powered vehicles may require a specific treatment from rescue services. It is therefore necessary to lay down requirements for the clear and rapid identification of such vehicles, allowing the rescue services to be informed of the fuel stored on board the vehicle.
Hydrogen components and systems must function in a correct and safe way and reliably withstand electrical, mechanical, thermal and chemical operating conditions without leaking or visibly deforming.
Hydrogen systems must be protected against over-pressurisation.
The materials used for those parts of the hydrogen components and systems which are to be in direct contact with hydrogen must be compatible with hydrogen.
Hydrogen components and systems reliably withstand expected temperatures and pressures during their expected lifetime.
Hydrogen components and systems reliably withstand the range of operating temperatures laid down in the implementing measures.
Hydrogen components must be marked in accordance with the implementing measures.
Hydrogen components with directional flow must have the flow direction clearly indicated.
Hydrogen components and systems must be designed in such a way that they can be installed in accordance with the requirements of Annex VI.
Hydrogen containers designed to use liquid hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex II.
Hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use liquid hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex III.
Hydrogen containers designed to use compressed (gaseous) hydrogen must be classified in accordance with point 1 of Annex IV.
The containers referred to in the first subparagraph must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex IV.
Hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use compressed (gaseous) hydrogen must be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex V.
Hydrogen components and systems must be installed in accordance with the requirements of Annex VI.
The Commission may adopt implementing measures in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RRS), including those relating to:
requirements relating to any of the following:
the use of pure hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas/biomethane;
new forms of hydrogen storage or usage;
the impact protection of vehicles with regard to the integrity of hydrogen components and systems;
integrated system safety requirements, covering at least the detection of leakage and requirements relating to purge gas;
electrical isolation and electric safety;
other measures necessary for the application of this Regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 24 February 2011.
WHAT REFERENCE IS MADE TO?
The regulation repeals Regulation (EC) No 694/2007.
