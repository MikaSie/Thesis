 Regulation (EU) 2018/1882 — Gross National Income at market prices
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the definition of gross national income (GNI) at market prices and the rules for its calculation in accordance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010).
It sets out the rules for the transmission of GNI data and additional information by the EU countries to the European Commission (Eurostat).
It lays down procedures and checks on the calculation of GNI by the EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Gross national income at market prices
GNI is defined in Article 1 of the regulation. It is calculated in accordance with the ESA 2010, which is established by Regulation (EU) No 549/2013. In accordance with point 8.89 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, GDP means the final result of the production activity of resident producer units. It can be defined in 3 ways:
production approach: GDP is the sum of gross value added of the various institutional sectors or the various industries plus taxes and less subsidies on products (which are not allocated to sectors and industries). It is also the balancing item in the total economy production account;
expenditure approach: GDP is the sum of final uses of goods and services by resident institutional units (final consumption and gross capital formation) plus exports and minus imports of goods and services;
income approach: GDP is the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy). In accordance with point 8.94 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, GNI means the total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. GNI equals GDP minus primary income payable by resident institutional units to non-resident institutional units plus primary income receivable by resident institutional units from the rest of the world.
Transmission of GNI data and additional information
Before 1 October each year, the EU countries must provide the Commission (Eurostat), in the context of national accounting procedures, with figures for GNI aggregates and their components, in accordance with the definitions referred to in Article 1. The transmission of data shall be accompanied by a report on the quality of GNI data. The Commission shall establish, by means of implementing acts, the structure and detailed arrangements of the inventory referred to in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, in accordance with Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, as well as the timetable for its updating and transmission. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 8(2) of this Regulation.
Procedures and checks on the calculation of GNI
The Commission shall verify the sources, their uses and the methods in the inventory referred to in Article 3(1). The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 7 to supplement the provision laid down in the first subparagraph of this paragraph by defining the list of issues to be addressed in every verification cycle to ensure the reliability, exhaustiveness and highest possible degree of comparability of GNI data, in line with ESA 2010. The Commission shall establish, by means of implementing acts, specific measures to make GNI data more comparable, reliable and exhaustive, based on the list of issues defined by the Commission in the delegated acts referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article. Such implementing acts shall be duly justified and in accordance with ESA 2010. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 8(2).
Without prejudice to the inspections provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 608/2014, GNI information visits may, where deemed appropriate, be carried out in EU countries by the Commission (Eurostat). The purposes of the information visits referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be the verification of the quality of GNI aggregates and their components and the verification of compliance with ESA 2010. In exercising its right to carry out such information visits, the Commission (Eurostat) shall respect the rules on statistical confidentiality laid down in Chapter V of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 18 April 2019.
BACKGROUND
GNI is an important analytical tool for the coordination of national economic policies and for various EU policies, as well as for research activities.
For own resources purposes, GNI means an annual GNI at market prices under the methodology set out in Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 which established the revised European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).
In accordance with Article 10(1) of Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, and subject to Article 10(2) thereof, Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom was repealed.

This regulation applies to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which fall within the scope of Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and their types which have been approved by the UK type-approval authority on the basis of those acts or any regulatory act of the Union listed in Annex IV to Directive 2007/46/EC or any regulatory act repealed by those regulatory acts of the Union.
Conditions for the granting of a Union type-approval and its effects
The Union type-approval may be granted on the basis of the same test reports which were used for the UK type-approval. Before granting a Union type-approval, the Union type-approval authority may request the repetition of specific tests. In that case, those tests shall be carried out by a technical service which has been designated and notified by the Member State of the Union type-approval authority in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628.
The type approved in accordance with the regulation shall receive an EU type-approval certificate with a number consisting of the distinguishing number of the Member State whose type-approval authority granted the Union type-approval and of the number of the applicable act referred to in Article 2(1). It shall also include the number of the latest amending act containing requirements for type-approval in accordance with which the Union type-approval is granted.
For vehicles, the type-approval certificate and the certificate of conformity shall, under ‘Remarks:’, contain the mention ‘Previously type-approved as’ and refer to the number and the date of the EU type-approval certificate received following the UK type-approval. For systems, components or separate technical units, the type-approval certificate shall contain the mention ‘Previously type-approved and marked as’ and refer to the type-approval mark received following the UK type-approval.
The Union type-approval shall take effect on the day of its granting or on a later date determined therein. The UK type-approval shall become invalid on the day preceding the day on which the Union type-approval takes effect. In any event, it shall become invalid at the latest on the day on which the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.
A Union type-approval shall be considered to be an EC type-approval or an EU type-approval within the meaning of Directive 2007/46/EC or any act listed in Annex IV to that Directive, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. All provisions of those acts not derogated from in this regulation shall continue to apply.
The Union type-approval authority shall take full responsibility for the obligations stemming from the Union type-approval. Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced on the basis of a UK type-approval which has become invalid as a result of the granting of a Union type-approval may be placed on the market, registered and entered into service in the EU until the Union type-approval legislation referred to in Article 2(1) ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom.

Summary 36:
 European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE)
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It establishes the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) (the ‘Instrument’). The Instrument aims to provide financial assistance to EU countries experiencing, or threatened with, a severe economic disturbance due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The financial assistance is intended to support short-time work schemes or similar measures, and, where appropriate, some health-related measures.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 25 March 2020.
KEY POINTS
The Instrument complements national measures taken by EU countries by providing financial assistance to help them cope with the sudden and severe increase in actual and possibly also planned public expenditure intended to mitigate the direct economic, social and health-related effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
EU countries may request financial assistance under the Instrument where their actual and possibly also planned public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased as of 1 February 2020 due to national measures directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures to address the socio-economic effects of the exceptional occurrence caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The financial assistance takes the form of a loan granted by the EU to the EU country concerned. The Commission borrows on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the EU.
The maximum amount of financial assistance is EUR 100 billion for all EU countries.
The Commission consults the EU country concerned before submitting a proposal to the Council. The Council then decides on the amount of the loan, its maximum average maturity, its pricing formula, its maximum number of instalments, its availability period and the other detailed rules needed for the granting of the financial assistance. The Council considers the existing and expected needs of the requesting EU country, as well as requests for financial assistance already submitted or planned to be submitted by other EU countries, while applying the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency.
The loan granted under the Instrument is disbursed in instalments.
The borrowing and lending operations under the Instrument are carried out in euros. The characteristics of the loan are agreed in a loan agreement between the beneficiary EU country and the Commission.
The prudential rules applicable to the portfolio of loans include a maximum share of loans granted to the 3 EU countries representing the largest share of the loans granted (60 %), a maximum annual exposure of EUR 50 billion, and a maximum amount of EUR 10 billion due by the EU in a given year.
The Commission establishes the necessary arrangements for the administration of the loans with the European Central Bank. The beneficiary EU country opens a special account with its national central bank for the management of the financial assistance received.
EU countries may contribute to the Instrument by counter-guaranteeing the risk borne by the EU. Contributions from EU countries are provided in the form of irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand guarantees.
The Instrument becomes available once the Commission has informed the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Financial Committee and the Employment Committee of the use of financial assistance and the continuation of the exceptional occurrences that justify the application of this Regulation. The period of availability of the Instrument ends on 31 December 2022. The Council may decide to extend the period of availability of the Instrument for an additional period of 6 months.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It applies from 25 March 2020.
BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 outbreak has had a massive and disruptive impact on the economic systems of EU countries, caused societal disruptions and increased public expenditure in a growing number of EU countries. The SURE aims to provide financial assistance to EU countries experiencing, or threatened with, a severe economic disturbance due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The financial assistance is intended to support short-time work schemes or similar measures, and, where appropriate, some health-related measures.

Summary 38:
 European Year of Rail 2021
The year 2021 will be designated the ‘European Year of Rail’, to encourage and support efforts across the European Union (EU) to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail.
WHAT DOES THIS DECISION DO?
It designates the year 2021 the ‘European Year of Rail’.
It sets out the objectives of the European Year, namely to promote rail as a sustainable, innovative, interconnected and intermodal, safe and affordable mode of transport.
KEY POINTS
To achieve the objectives, the European Commission will:
consider initiatives such as a European label for goods and products transported by rail and a rail connectivity index;
support the creation of a European rail network;
support the development of innovative solutions and services for rail passengers;
support the development of a European rail sector;
encourage the use of rail in remote areas and rural regions;
support the development of a rail sector workforce;
support the development of new rail products;
support the development of a European rail tourism market;
support the development of a rail freight market;
support the development of a European rail passenger market;
support the development of a rail sector for people with disabilities;
support the development of a rail sector for young people.
The Commission will also:
coordinate the European Year at Union level;
support the European Year at national level;
cooperate with international organisations;
monitor and evaluate the European Year.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
The decision applies from 1 January 2021 until 31 December 2022.
BACKGROUND
The European Green Deal aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050.
The EU aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The transport sector accounts for a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, a share that is still growing. To achieve climate neutrality, a 90 % reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050.
The European Green Deal implies accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobility in order to address those challenges. In particular, a substantial part of the 75 % of inland freight carried today by road should be shifted onto rail and inland waterways.
Rail has a significant role to play as a game changer in achieving the climate neutrality objective by 2050. It is one of the most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. Rail is largely electrified and emits far less CO2 than equivalent travel by road or air. It is the only transport mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990. In addition, rail has decreased its energy consumption between 1990 and 2016 and increasingly uses renewable energy sources.
The COVID-19 crisis has hit the transport sector exceptionally hard. Despite operational and financial constraints, the sector has maintained crucial connections both for the transport of people and of essential goods. This has been possible mainly thanks to the employees who have continued working under difficult and uncertain conditions. The strategic role played by rail during the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted that achieving the single European railway area is necessary both for facilitating the supply of essential goods, such as food, medicines and fuel, particularly in exceptional circumstances, and for achieving wider transport policy objectives.
The rail sector is sometimes hampered by outdated business and operational practices, by ageing infrastructure and rolling stock and by noisy wagons. Overcoming those obstacles together with reducing costs, studying Union schemes to supplement national mechanisms for non-discriminatory support for rail operators, and accelerating innovation will allow rail to realise its full potential, while ensuring the functioning of the internal market, increasing rail traffic and further improving the already high safety levels.
The year 2021 will be important for the EU rail policy, since it will represent the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the EU, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services, on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the EU and on providing the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) with additional tasks that aim to lower technical barriers.
The European Year of Rail will contribute to a pan-European debate on the future of railways.

 EU statistics on inland waterways transport
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on EU statistics on inland waterways transport
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes common rules for the production of European statistics concerning inland waterways transport.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to inland waterways transport in the EU. It does not apply to the transport of goods by vessels of less than 50 deadweight tonnes, vessels used principally for the carriage of passengers, vessels used for ferrying purposes, vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes by port administrations and public authorities, vessels used solely for bunkering or storage, and vessels not used for the carriage of goods such as fishery vessels, dredgers, floating workshops, houseboats and pleasure craft.
Data
Member States must transmit data relating to inland waterways transport on their national territory to the European Commission (Eurostat). They must do so as soon as possible and no later than 5 months after the end of the relevant period of observation.
Inland waterways transport is an important part of the EU’s transport networks. The Commission therefore needs statistics on the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy.
Data collection
The Commission must arrange for pilot studies to be conducted on the availability of statistical data relating to passenger transport by inland waterways, including by cross border transport services. The EU contributes to the cost of carrying out those pilot studies in the form of grants awarded to the national statistical institutes and other national authorities.
Quality of data
Member States must take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the data transmitted. The Commission (Eurostat) must assess the quality of the data transmitted.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 7 December 2016.
BACKGROUND
              
The regulation is one of the EU’s statistics regulations which set out common rules for the production of European statistics.

It sets out common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at European Union (EU) level.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to all railways in the EU.
Each EU country must report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory.
Definitions
The regulation defines a number of terms, including:
railway: a line or system of lines designed for the carriage of passengers or goods, or both, by rail vehicles operated by one or more undertakings, on which service is regularly provided;
metro: a railway for the transport of passengers that operates in a dense urban area with high passenger traffic volumes, which uses fully automated or partly automated vehicles and which is usually fully segregated from other road traffic;
tram (streetcar): a passenger road vehicle designed to seat more than nine persons (including the driver), which is connected to electric conductors or powered by diesel engine and which is rail-borne;
light rail: a railway for the transport of passengers that often uses electrically powered rail-borne cars operating singly or in short trains on fixed duo-rail lines;
international transport: rail transport between a place (of loading/embarkation or unloading/disembarkation) located in the reporting country. It may involve transit through a second country;
transit: rail transport through the reporting country between two places (a place of loading/embarkation and a place of unloading/disembarkation) outside the reporting country. Transport operations involving loading/embarkation or unloading/disembarkation of goods/passengers at the border of the reporting country from/onto another mode of transport are not considered as transit;
rail passenger: any person, excluding members of the train crew, who makes a trip by rail. Only the distance on the national territory of the reporting country shall be taken into account;
goods: any material object that can be moved, shipped, carried or transferred from one location to another.
Reporting
EU countries must report statistics based on the data specified in the Annexes to the regulation. The Annexes specify the types of data to be collected, the type of transport, the type of consignment, the type of activity, the type of transport and the type of consignment.
