It aims to enhance cross-border access to a greater number of television and radio programmes, by facilitating the clearance of rights for the provision of online services that are ancillary to the broadcast of certain types of television and radio programmes, and for the retransmission of television and radio programmes. It also lays down rules for the transmission of television and radio programmes through the process of direct injection. KEY POINTS The directive applies to ancillary online services offered by a broadcasting organisation, which have a clear and subordinate relationship with the broadcasting organisation’s broadcasts. These services include services that give access to television and radio programmes in a strictly linear manner, simultaneously to the broadcast, and services that give access, within a defined time period after the broadcast, to television and radio programmes which have been previously broadcast by the broadcasting organisation, so-called ‘catch-up services’. The directive does not apply to any subsequent communication to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, or to any subsequent making available to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, or to any subsequent reproduction of the works or other protected subject matter which are contained in the ancillary online service. The directive does not apply to any subsequent communication to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, or to any subsequent making available to the public of works or other protected subject matter, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, or to any subsequent reproduction of the works or other protected subject matter which are contained in the ancillary online service. FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY? It has applied since 7 June 2021. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 7 June 2021. KEY TERMS Retransmission: the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission by a cable or microwave system for reception by the public of an initial transmission from another EU country, by wire or over the air, including that by satellite, of television or radio programmes intended for reception by the public, regardless of how the operator of a cable retransmission service obtains the programme-carrying signals from the broadcasting organisation for the purpose of retransmission. Retransmission: the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission by a cable or microwave system for reception by the public of an initial transmission from another EU country, by wire or over the air, including that by satellite, of television or radio programmes intended for reception by the public, regardless of how the operator of a cable retransmission service obtains the programme-carrying signals from the broadcasting organisation for the purpose of retransmission.

Harmon Harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) Harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It lays down a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) at EU and national level. KEY POINTS Harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP, HICP-CT, OOH price index) and of the house price index (HPI) are used in the context of the Commission’s macroeconomic imbalance procedure, as established by Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) uses the HICP as an index in order to measure the achievement of the ESCB’s price stability objective under Article 127(1) TFEU, which is of particular relevance for the definition and implementation of the monetary policy of the EU under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The HICP and the HICP-CT are based on the price changes and weights of products included in the household final monetary consumption expenditure. Neither the HICP nor the HICP-CT cover transactions between households, except in the case of rentals paid by tenants to private landlords, where the latter act as market producers of services purchased by households (tenants). The OOH price index is compiled, where possible and provided that the data are available, for the 10 years preceding the entry into force of this regulation. Each year, EU countries update sub-index weights for the harmonised indices. The Commission adopts implementing acts specifying uniform conditions for the application of the ECOICOP for the purpose of the HICP and the HICP and the HICP-CT. Each year, EU countries update sub-index weights for the harmonised indices.

Recovery recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) Recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs) which are failing or likely to fail while winding up the remaining activities through normal insolvency proceedings, and to preserve financial stability and to avoid a significant adverse effect on the financial system and its ability to serve the real economy while minimising the cost to taxpayers of a CCP failure. KEY POINTS The regulation sets out measures to recover from financial distress, to maintain the critical functions of a CCP which is failing or likely to fail while winding up the remaining activities through normal insolvency proceedings, and to preserve financial stability and to avoid a significant adverse effect on the financial system and its ability to serve the real economy while minimising the cost to taxpayers of a CCP failure. The regulation also sets out a recovery plan, which must be drawn up annually and in any case after any change to its legal or organisational structure or business or financial situation which could have a material effect on those plans or otherwise necessitate a change to the plans, review, test and, where necessary, update its recovery plans. The resolution authority of the CCP must draw up and maintain a recovery plan providing for measures to be taken in the case of both default and non-default events and combinations of both, in order to restore their financial soundness, without any extraordinary public financial support, and allow them to continue to provide critical functions following a significant deterioration of their financial situation or a risk of breaching their capital and prudential requirements. The resolution authority may require the CCP to provide them with detailed records of the contracts referred to in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 and Article 54 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. The resolution authority of the CCP must draw up and maintain a recovery plan providing for measures to be taken in the case of both default and non-default events and combinations of both, in order to restore their financial soundness, without any extraordinary public financial support, and allow them to continue to provide critical functions following a significant deterioration of their financial situation or a risk of breaching their capital and prudential requirements.

The resolution authority may also take a resolution action where it considers that the CCP has applied or intends to apply recovery measures which could prevent the CCP’s failure but cause significant adverse effects to the financial system of the EU or of one of its Member States. The resolution authority may also take a resolution action where it considers that the CCP has applied or intends to apply recovery measures which could prevent the CCP’s failure but cause significant adverse effects to the financial system of the EU or of one of its Member States.

EU system for supply chain due diligence The EU system for supply chain due diligence The EU system for supply chain due diligence SUMMARY OF: Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/005 on the EU system for supply chain due diligence WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It establishes a Union system for supply chain due diligence* in order to curtail opportunities for armed groups and security forces to trade in tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold. KEY POINTS Importers of minerals or metals must: adopt and clearly communicate to suppliers and the public up-to-date information on their supply chain policy for the minerals and metals potentially originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas; incorporate in their supply chain policy standards against which supply chain due diligence is to be conducted consistent with the standards set out in Annex III to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance; identify and assess the risks in their supply chain based on available third-party audit reports concerning the smelters and refiners in that chain, and, by assessing, as appropriate, the due diligence practices of those smelters and refiners; report the findings of the risk assessment to their senior management; implement a response strategy designed to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts, consistent with Annex II to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and with the specific recommendations set out in that Guidance. EU importers of minerals or metals must make available to EU competent authorities the reports of any third-party audit carried out in accordance with Article 6 or evidence of conformity with a supply chain due diligence scheme recognised by the Commission. If there is evidence of repeated or significant cases where economic operators implementing a scheme recognised in accordance with Article 8 have failed to fulfil the requirements of this regulation, the Commission may grant the scheme owner an appropriate period of time to take remedial action. EU importers of minerals or metals must: make available to EU competent authorities the reports of any third-party audit carried out in accordance with Article 6 or evidence of conformity with a supply chain due diligence scheme recognised by the Commission; report the findings of the risk assessment to their senior management; implement a response strategy designed to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts, consistent with Annex II to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and with the specific recommendations set out in that Guidance.

Fishing of tropical tunas Fishing of tropical tunas SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It aims to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishing resources in the area covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. KEY POINTS Scope The regulation applies to EU fishing vessels used or intended for use for the purposes of fishing in the area covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. EU countries must: inform the European Commission by 15 June each year of which of the two closure periods from 29 July to 8 October, or from 9 November to 19 January, shall be applicable to their vessels; inform all interested parties in their tuna industry of the November to 19 January, shall be applicable to their vessels; ensure that for the entire duration of the closure all purse seine vessels that fly its flag do not fish in the Convention area. Fishing on data buoys EU fishing vessels must: report daily information on all active fish-aggregating devices (FADs) to the European Commission at intervals submitted with a time delay of at least 60 days, but with a time interval of not more than 90 days between each report; collect and report any interaction with FADs to EU countries; report daily information on all active FADs to the Commission at intervals submitted with a time delay of at least 60 days, but with a time interval of not more than 90 days between each report; limit bycatch of silky sharks to a maximum of 20 % of the total catch by fishing trip in weight; promptly release sharks (whether alive or dead) caught that are not retained unharmed, to the extent practicable, as soon as they are seen in the net or on the deck, without compromising the safety of any persons. The master of a purse seine vessel must: avoid encirclement of sea turtles to the extent practicable and carry on board, and bycatch in all gear types used in the eastern Pacific Ocean; promptly release, in a manner that causes the least harm to the extent practicable, all sea turtles, without compromising the safety of any persons. EU countries must support research and development of modified FAD designs to reduce sea turtle entanglement as well as take measures to encourage the use of designs found to be successful at such reduction. The master of a purse seine vessel must: carry on-board and, when sea turtle interactions occur, employ the necessary equipment (e.g. de-hookers, line cutters, and scoop nets) for the prompt release of sea turtles incidentally caught; when the majority of hooks fish at depths shallower than 100 metres, employ one of the following two mitigation measures: large circle hooks or the use only of finfish for bait; report any interactions to the national authorities.

Conservation of marine biological resources Conservation of marine biological resources SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out the rules for the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources. It aims to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. KEY POINTS Scope The CFP covers the activities carried out on the territory of EU countries to which the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union applies, including by fishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, non-EU countries; by Union fishing vessels outside EU waters; or by nationals of EU countries, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag State. The CFP applies the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and aims to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield. EU countries may cooperate with one another for the purpose of adopting measures pursuant to Articles 11, 15 and 18. Multiannual plans are adopted as a priority, based on scientific, technical and economic advice, and contain conservation measures to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. Before measures are included in the multiannual plans, account must be taken of their likely economic and social impact. Multiannual plans may contain specific conservation objectives and measures based on the ecosystem approach in order to address the specific problems of mixed fisheries in relation to the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 2(2) for the mixture of stocks covered by the plan in cases where scientific advice indicates that increases in selectivity cannot be achieved. Where necessary, the multiannual plan may include specific alternative conservation measures, based on the ecosystem approach, for some of the stocks that it covers. EU countries may conduct pilot projects, based on the best available scientific advice and taking into account the opinions of the relevant Advisory Councils, with the aim of fully exploring all practicable methods for the avoidance, minimisation and elimination of unwanted catches in a fishery. EU fishing vessels have equal access to EU waters other than those referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, subject to the measures adopted under Part III. EU countries may cooperate with one another for the purpose of adopting measures pursuant to Articles 11, 15 and 18.

It is also necessary to ensure that their members carry out fishing and aquaculture activities in a sustainable manner, improve the placing on the market of products, collect information on aquaculture and improve their incomes. It is possible for competent national authorities to take responsibility for the implementation of those objectives, working closely with producer organisations on management issues, including, where appropriate, the allocation of quotas and the management of fishing effort, depending on the needs of each particular, the allocation of quotas and the management of fishing effort. It is also necessary to maintain the link between individual coastal communities and the fisheries and waters that they have historically exploited is respected. The unpredictability of fishing activities makes it appropriate to set up a mechanism for storing fishery products for human consumption with a view to fostering greater market stability and increasing the return on products, in particular by creating added value.

European territorial cooperation (EGTC) European territorial cooperation (EGTC) SUMMARY OF: Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 on the European Regional Development Fund WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION? It sets out the rules for the European territorial cooperation goal (ESDP), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (Cohesion Fund), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). It also lays down the provisions necessary to ensure effective implementation, monitoring, financial management and control of operational programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal (ESDP), including when third countries participate in such cooperation programmes. KEY POINTS The European territorial cooperation goal (ESDP) is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions. The aim of the ESDP is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.
