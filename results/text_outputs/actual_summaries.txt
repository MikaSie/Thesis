Cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings
Cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 on facilitating cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings and amending Regulations (EU) No 345/2013, (EU) No 346/2013 and (EU) No 1286/2014
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It sets out uniform rules for national regulation concerning marketing requirements for collective investment undertakings (or ‘investment funds’) and on marketing communications addressed to investors, to improve market efficiency as part of establishing the EU’s capital markets union.
It also sets out a common approach to fees and charges levied on investment fund managers for their cross-border activities and proposes a central database on the cross-border marketing of collective investment undertakings.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies to:
Alternative investment fund (AIF)* managers*;
Undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)* management companies, including any UCITS which has not designated a UCITS management company;
European venture capital fund (EuVECA)* managers; and
European social entrepreneurship fund (EuSEF)* managers.
Marketing communications
AIFMs, EuVECA, EuSEF and UCITS managers, as well as UCITS management companies, must ensure that all marketing communications addressed to investors are identifiable as such and describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF or units of a UCITS in an equally prominent manner. Marketing communications should: be fair, clear and not misleading;indicate that a prospectus exists and that key investor information is available, and specify where, how and in what language investors can obtain the prospectus and key information;specify where, how and in what language investors can obtain a summary of investor rights, which will include, where appropriate, information on access to collective redress mechanisms at EU and national level in the event of litigation;contain clear information indicating that the manager or the management company may decide to stop marketing its investment fund.
Competent authorities must keep their websites up to date with complete information on applicable national laws, regulations and administrative rules, including summaries, governing marketing requirements for AIFs and UCITS, in a language customary for international finance.
To verify compliance with this regulation and national rules on marketing requirements, competent authorities may require advance notice of marketing communications intended by UCITS management companies to be used directly or indirectly in their dealings with investors.
Fees and charges
Common principles regarding fees and charges levied by competent authorities on managers of collective investment undertakings for their cross-border activities must be consistent with the overall costs of the competent authority.
By 2 February 2022, The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will make publicly available on its website an interactive tool that provides an indicative calculation of the fees or charges.
Central database
The regulation also introduces a central database regarding the international marketing of AIFs and UCITS within the EU. ESMA must publish this database on its website by 2 February 2022, in a language customary for international finance.
Pre-marketing*
The regulation introduces rules on pre-marketing EuVECAs and EuSEFs from 2 August 2021, in line with those laid down for alternative investment funds in Directive (EU) 2019/1160. The rules are aimed at allowing managers to target investors by testing their appetite for upcoming investment opportunities or strategies through qualifying venture capital funds and qualifying social entrepreneurship funds.
Reporting
Competent authorities must report to ESMA on marketing communications by 31 March 2021 and every 2 years, outlining the number of requests for amendments of marketing communications, clearly distinguishing the most frequent breaches, and giving examples.
Evaluation
By 2 August 2024, the European Commission through public consultation and discussion with ESMA and competent authorities, will conduct an evaluation of the application of the regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 August 2019. Article 4(1) to (5) on marketing information, Article 5(1) and (2) on competent authority websites, and Articles 15 and 16 on amendments to previous legislation concerning pre-marketing of EuVECAs and EuSEFs apply from 2 August 2021.

Summary 2:
Copyright — broadcasters’ online transmissions and retransmissions of television and radio programmes
Copyright — broadcasters’ online transmissions and retransmissions of television and radio programmes
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/789 — rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to improve the cross-border availability of television and radio programmes in the EU’s single market, by making it easier to clear copyright and related rights* for certain online services of broadcasters and for the retransmission* of television and radio programmes by means other than cable.
It also contains rules for programmes transmitted via direct injection*.
KEY POINTS
‘Country of origin’ principle* for certain online services provided by broadcasters
In addition to traditional forms of broadcasting, broadcasters increasingly offer simultaneous transmissions over the internet (simulcasting) and the possibility to view or listen to a programme online after a defined period of time (catch-up services).
The directive provides that, to include certain programmes in their online services available across borders, broadcasters only need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders of the works and other subject-matter contained in those programmes for the EU country where they have their principal establishment.
This ‘country of origin’ principle (already used for satellite broadcasting in Directive 93/83/EEC) applies to all radio programmes and to certain types of television programmes: news and current affairs programmes (except sports events and protected subject-matter included in them); andprogrammes that are produced and fully financed by a broadcaster itself.
Existing contracts remain unaffected for 4 years from the entry into force of the directive (until 7 June 2023).
Mandatory collective management of rights for retransmission of radio and television programmes by means other than cable
The directive also makes it easier to obtain the authorisation of holders of copyright and related rights for the retransmission of television or radio programmes from other EU countries. Rights holders can exercise their right to authorise or deny authorisation for such retransmissions only via a collective management organisation*, except for the rights that are already held by the concerned broadcasters. This applies to the simultaneous, unaltered and unabridged retransmission via any means other than cable, including the open internet (but only when the retransmission over the open internet takes place in a secure environment and to a group of authorised users). Retransmissions by cable are covered by Directive 93/83/EEC.
EU countries must ensure that mediation is available to assist the parties in the conclusion of licences for retransmission services.
EU countries are also explicitly allowed to apply the rules described above when transmissions and retransmissions take place within their territory.
Direct injection
The directive lays down rules that regulate the use of protected works or other subject-matter via ‘direct injection’, i.e. the technique by which a broadcaster transmits its signal to distributors via a private line - in a way that those signals cannot be received by the general public during that transmission - and, subsequently, the distributor offers the relevant programmes to the public.
When direct injection is used, and there is no parallel transmission of the same programmes by the broadcaster itself, the broadcasting organisation and the signal distributor are deemed to be participating in a single act of communication to the public. This means that both parties need to obtain authorisation for their respective participation in that activity.
Existing contracts remain unaffected for 6 years from the entry into force of the directive (until 7 June 2025).
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has applied since 6 June 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 7 June 2021.
BACKGROUND

KEY TERMS
              
Related rights: rights granted to performers, producers and broadcasters (as opposed to copyright or authors’ rights) which enable rightholders to control the use of their works and other protected material and be remunerated for their use.
Retransmission: in the context of Directive (EU) 2019/789, the licensing of rights when radio and television programmes are retransmitted by other radio and TV channels but also over the internet (parallel transmissions/simulcasting or catch-up services when consumers can view/listen to programmes at a time that is later than the original broadcast).
Direct injection: a technical process by which a broadcaster transmits programme-carrying signals to a distributor, in such a way that the signals are not accessible to the public during the transmission.
Country of origin principle: broadcasters only need to clear copyright in their EU country of establishment (i.e. the country of origin) in order to make radio programmes, TV news and current affairs as well as their fully financed own productions available online in all EU countries.
Collective management organisations: organisations which collect, manage and distribute earnings from the exploitation of the rights the responsibility for which rightsholders have delegated to them.

Summary 3:
Mutual recognition of goods
Mutual recognition of goods
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/515 on the mutual recognition of goods lawfully marketed in another EU country
WHAT IS THE AIM OF OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to strengthen the internal market by improving the application of the mutual recognition principle* in the field of goods and removing unjustified barriers to trade. It does so by:
defining the principle’s rights and obligations for national authorities and businesses when goods are sold in another EU country;
providing safeguards when mutual recognition would be denied in individual cases;
reinforcing the role of national product contact points as providers of information and points of communication between national authorities and companies.
The legislation replaces Regulation (EC) No 764/2008.
KEY POINTS
              
The mutual recognition principle ensures market access for goods that are not, or are only partly, subject to EU harmonisation legislation.
The regulation applies to:
all types of goods lawfully marketed in another EU country, including agricultural and fisheries products, irrespective of the way they are produced and processed;
national administrative decisions that restrict or deny access to that country’s market to such goods.
When a competent authority in the importing country intends to assess the goods, businesses may use a voluntary mutual recognition declaration to demonstrate that the goods are lawfully marketed in another EU country.
National authorities assessing imported goods under the mutual recognition principle must:
immediately contact the business concerned explaining the planned assessment;
allow the goods to be distributed and sold while they make the assessment (unless there is a prior authorisation procedure for the goods in their country or if they temporarily suspend market access);
accept a mutual recognition declaration, together with supporting evidence necessary to verify the information contained in it , as sufficient to demonstrate that the goods are lawfully marketed in another EU country. If no declaration is supplied, the competent authority may request the business concerned to provide documentation and information about both the characteristics of the goods or type of goods in question and the lawful marketing of the goods in another EU country;
take due account of the content of test reports or certificates issued by a conformity assessment body that have been provided by any business as part of the assessment;
notify the business immediately — and the European Commission and EU countries within 20 days — if it decides to deny or restrict market access to the goods;
when adopting a negative administrative decision, set out in a sufficiently detailed and reasoned manner why they restrict or deny market access, including the following the national technical rule on which the decision is basedthe legitimate public interest grounds justifying the use of the national technical rulethe scientific and technical evidence considereda summary of the relevant arguments the business concerned put forwardevidence demonstrating that the decision is proportionatethe various national remedies open to the business and their time limits, including the possibility to use the free service SOLVIT (which may lead to an Opinion of the Commission).
National authorities assessing imported goods may temporarily suspend their sale or distribution, immediately informing the business, the Commission and EU countries, if:
under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, the goods pose a serious risk to safety or health of persons or to the environment, including one where the effects are not immediate, which requires rapid intervention by the competent authority; or
the making available of the goods, or of goods of that type, on the market in that EU country is generally prohibited in that EU country on grounds of public morality or public security.
If SOLVIT centres are not able to find a good solution in an individual case using the SOLVIT procedure, the Commission may assist in solving the case at the request of any of the SOLVIT Centres involved by issuing an Opinion. For this, the Commission:
must assess whether the national authority’s decision is compatible with the mutual recognition principle and the requirements of the regulation;
if additional information or documents are needed, must ask the relevant SOLVIT Centre to contact the business or the competent authority, to obtain such additional information or documents;
must issue an Opinion within 45 days;
the opinion must be communicated to the business and the national authority by the relevant SOLVIT Centre. The Commission must notify the Opinion to the EU countries;
where appropriate, the Commission’s Opinion must identify any concerns that should be addressed in the SOLVIT case or must make recommendations to assist in solving the case.
Each EU country must establish and maintain on its territory product contact points, and ensure they have sufficient powers and adequate resources. The product contact points must:
provide online information on the mutual recognition principle and the application of the regulation in their countrycontact details of the relevant national authorities, including those of the authorities responsible for supervising the implementation of the national technical rules applicable in their countryremedies and procedures available in their country in the event of a dispute, including the SOLVIT procedure set out in the regulation;
respond, free of charge, within 15 days to requests from companies or national authorities for further information;
when necessary, help to arrange contacts between national authorities in relation to the assessment procedure of the regulation.
The EU may finance the following activities in support of the regulation:
awareness-raising campaigns;
education and training;
cooperation among product contact points and competent authorities, and the technical and logistic support for this cooperation;
the collection of data related to the functioning of the principle of mutual recognition and its impact on the EU’s single market for goods;
exchange of officials and of best practices.
The Commission must carry out an evaluation of the regulation by 20 April 2025, and every 4 years thereafter, and submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.
Implementing act
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1668 sets out the details necessary to adapt Information and Communication System for Market surveillance (ICSMS) for the purposes of mutual recognition.
The implementing regulation introduces the use of the ICSMS for:
notifications of administrative decisions (Article 5);
notifications of temporary suspensions (Article 6);
notification of the Commission’s opinion to all EU countries (Article 8);
exchange of information between the competent authorities of the EU countries in charge of verifying data and documents supplied by the businesses during an assessment (Article 10).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 19 April 2020.
BACKGROUND

Mutual recognition of goods (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Mutual recognition principle: a principle of EU law under which EU countries may not prohibit the sale on their territory of goods which are lawfully marketed in another EU country.

The .eu top-level domain
The .eu top-level domain
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/517 on the implementation and functioning of the .eu top-level domain name
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The regulation updates the rules about the .eu top-level domain (TLD), as part of the EU’s new digital single market strategy. It aims to reinforce the EU’s online identity and encourage cross-border online activities.
Due to the rapid evolution of the TLD market (for example new domain name extensions such as .com and .org have been introduced) and the volatility of the digital landscape a  modernised, more flexible and sustainable regulatory environment for the .eu TLD was introduced by the regulation, replacing the old legal framework with a lighter, more efficient and future-proof principle-based legal instrument.
The regulation creates a new governance structure, involving a separate multi-stakeholder body, with the goal of strengthening and widening input on the performance of the .eu TLD.
It introduces new eligibility criteria to enable EU/EEA citizens to register a .eu domain, regardless of where they live.
KEY POINTS
Promoting and safeguarding EU values
The purpose of the .eu domain, as a clear and easily recognisable label, is to contribute to strengthening the EU’s profile and promote its values online, such as multilingualism, respect for user privacy and security, and respect for human rights.
Eligibility for domain name registration
A .eu domain may be requested by:
EU and EEA citizens, wherever they live;
non-EU citizens residing in an EU country;
businesses established in the EU; and
other organisations established in the EU, if permitted under applicable national law.
Rules on revoking domain name registration
The Registry* may revoke a domain name on its own initiative, on the following grounds:
there are outstanding unpaid debts owed to the Registry;
the domain name holder is ineligible;
the domain name holder breaches the requirements for registration requests on the following grounds: a domain name deemed defamatory, racist or contrary to public policy or public security should be blocked subject to a court decisiona domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a name for which a right is established by EU or national law, and which has been registered without rights or without a legitimate interest in the name should, in principle, be revoked, and where appropriate, transferred to the legitimate holderwhere such a domain name has been used in bad faith, it should always be revoked.
Registry
The designated Registry is a non-profit organisation able to impose fees for costs incurred, and will:
promote the .eu TLD in the EU and worldwide;
comply with the rules, policies and procedures in this regulation and its contract with the European Commission, and particularly EU data protection law;
organise, administer and manage the .eu TLD in the general interest and assure high quality, transparency, security, stability, predictability, reliability, accessibility, efficiency, non-discrimination, a level playing field and consumer protection;
ensure that abusive domain name registrations are quickly identified;
cooperate with competent authorities and other public bodies responsible for cybersecurity and information security, such as national computer emergency response teams.
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/857 establishes the points to be included in the contract between the Commission and the Registry for the organisation, administration and management of the .eu TLD. These include:
the principles of good governance and good management;
security and consumer protection aspects;
promotion of EU objectives in internet governance;
having policies and procedures in place to actively combat speculative and abusive domain name registrations in the .eu TLD.
WHOIS database*
The Registry is responsible for setting up and managing a WHOIS database facility providing accurate and up-to-date registration information about the domain names including information about an administrative point of contact and domain name holders.
.eu Multi-Stakeholder Advisory Group
This group is responsible for advising the Commission on: implementation of this regulation;strategic issues related to the management, organisation and administration of the .eu TLD, including cyber-protection and data protection;good practices on combating abusive domain name registration.
The Advisory Group is composed of representatives of EU-based stakeholders and a representative of stakeholders from outside the EU, chaired by a representative of the Commission or a person designated by the Commission.
Evaluation and review
By 13 October 2027, and then every 3 years, the Commission evaluates the effectiveness and functioning of the .eu TLD.
By June 2020 at the latest, the Commission should evaluate the cooperation between the .eu Registry and the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and other EU agencies with regard to combating speculative and abusive registration of domain names, and simplifying administrative procedures, in particular for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Repeal
The regulation repeals Regulations (EC) No 733/2002 and (EC) No 874/2004 from 12 October 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?

Regulation (EU) 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe — the framework programme for research and innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes Horizon Europe — the framework programme for research and innovation (the ‘programme’) for the duration of the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework , and lays down its rules for participation and dissemination.The regulation:
determines the framework governing European Union (EU) support for research and innovation (R & I) in terms of the scientific and technological objectives to be achieved and the relevant priorities, indicates the broad lines of such activities and fixes the maximum overall amount and the detailed rules for EU financial participation in the framework programme and the respective shares in each of the activities provided for;
sets out rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and lays down the rules governing the dissemination of research results.
KEY POINTS
Implementation
The programme is implemented through:
the specific programme established by Decision (EU) 2021/764 (see summary);
a financial contribution to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/819;
the specific programme on defence research established by Regulation (EU) 2021/697 (see summary).
Objectives
The general objective of the programme is to deliver scientific, technological, economic and societal impact from the EU’s investments in R & I so as to:
strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases and foster competitiveness in all EU Member States, including in its industry;
deliver on the EU’s strategic priorities and contribute to the fulfilment of its objectives and policies;
tackle global challenges, including meeting the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) by following the principles of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement;
strengthen the European research area (ERA).
The programme thus maximises EU added value by focusing on objectives and activities that cannot be effectively fulfilled by Member States acting alone, but rather in cooperation.
The programme has the following specific objectives:
to develop, promote and advance scientific excellence, support the creation and diffusion of high-quality new fundamental and applied knowledge of skills, technologies and solutions, support training and mobility of researchers, attract talent at all levels and contribute to the full engagement of the EU’s talent pool in actions supported under the programme;
to generate knowledge, strengthen the impact of R & I in developing, supporting and implementing EU policies and support access to and the uptake of innovative solutions in European industry, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises, and address global societal challenges, including climate change and the sustainable development goals;
to foster all forms of innovation, facilitate technological development, demonstration and knowledge and technology transfer, and strengthen the deployment and exploitation of innovative solutions;
to optimise the programme’s delivery with a view to strengthening and increasing the impact and attractiveness of the European research area, foster excellence-based participation from all Member States, including low-R & I-performing countries, in the programme and facilitate collaborative links in European R & I.
Structure and budget
The programme is structured as follows, with a total budget of €95.5 billion at current prices (including €5.4 billion from NextGenerationEU).
Pillar I — Excellent science
With these components:
European Research Council

Missions are portfolios of excellence-based and impact-driven R & I activities across disciplines and sectors, intended to:
achieve, within a set time frame, a measurable goal that could not be achieved through individual actions;
have an impact on society and policymaking through science and technology;
be relevant for a significant part of the EU population and a wide range of EU citizens.
Five areas for possible missions are identified in this legal act:
adaptation to climate change, including societal transformation
cancer
healthy oceans, seas and coastal and inland waters
climate-neutral and smart cities
soil health and food.
Each mission area has a dedicated mission board, which advises the Commission in specifying, designing and implementing specific missions.
European partnerships
A streamlined landscape of three forms of European partnerships (co-funded, co-programmed and institutionalised) has been created in which the EU, national authorities and the private sector commit to supporting research and innovation efforts.
The European Innovation Council
The EIC has been created as a centrally managed one-stop shop for implementing actions under Pillar III ‘Innovative Europe’ which relate to the EIC. The EIC’s focus is mainly on breakthrough and disruptive innovation, especially targeting market-creating innovation, while also supporting all types of innovation, including incremental innovation.

Controls on weapons purchases and possession
Controls on weapons purchases and possession
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2021/555 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It sets common minimum standards on the acquisition, possession, and commercial exchange of civilian firearms (e.g. firearms used for sport shooting and hunting) within the European Union (EU). This helps to balance internal market objectives (i.e. the cross-border movement of firearms) and security policy objectives (i.e. the high level of security and protection against criminal acts and illicit trafficking) within the EU.
The directive codifies and repeals Directive 91/477/EEC (and its subsequent amendments).
KEY POINTS
              
The directive sets outs the categories of weapons whose acquisition and possession by private individuals will have to be either:
prohibited (category A); or
subject to authorisation (category B); or
subject to declaration (category C).
Where firearms have been legally acquired and possessed in accordance with the directive, national rules on carrying, hunting or shooting should apply.
Marking and registration
EU Member States must:
ensure that all firearms manufactured in or imported into the EU on or after 14 September 2018 bear a clear, permanent and unique marking and are registered in Member States’ data-filing systems;
carry out strict checks on the activities of dealers and brokers;
set up a computerised, centralised or decentralised data filing system, guaranteeing authorised access to the data-filing systems;
ensure that data relating to firearms, including related personal data (governed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — see summary), are kept by the competent authorities in the data-filing system for a period of 30 years after the destruction of the firearms or essential components in question.
Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/68, establishes technical specifications for the marking of firearms and their essential components under Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons.
Tracing
Arms dealers and brokers must keep a register including:
a record of all entries and exits in relation to each firearm;
data enabling the identification and tracing of the firearm.
Arms dealers and brokers based in a Member State must report transactions involving firearms to the competent national authorities without undue delay.
Acquisition and possession of weapons
Member States may only permit the acquisition and possession of firearms by persons who have been issued with a licence or, for category C firearms, by persons who are specifically allowed to acquire or possess such firearms in accordance with national law.
Acquisition and possession of firearms is only permitted for persons who: have a valid reason and who have reached the age of 18 (except for hunting and sport shooting where parental authorisation is required); orare not likely to present a danger to themselves or others, public order or public safety.
Member States may grant category A authorisations to marksmen and sportsmen for some prohibited semi-automatic firearms, as well as to recognised museums and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, to collectors, in accordance with strict security measures.
Authorisations must be reviewed at least every 5 years.
Deactivation
The directive includes deactivated firearms because of the high risk of reactivating those improperly deactivated firearms. Deactivated firearms are classified in category C.
The deactivation of firearms must be checked by a competent authority.
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403 establishes common guidelines on deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable.
Converted weapons
Because of the high risk of conversion into lethal firearms, the directive also applies to:
salute and acoustic weapons (firearms specifically converted for the sole use of firing blanks, irritants, other active substances or pyrotechnic rounds);
alarm and signal weapons (weapons which are designed to fire only blanks, irritants, other active substances or pyrotechnic signalling rounds, but which may be converted into real firearms).
Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/69 lays down technical specifications for alarm and signal weapons.
Semi-automatic weapons
Firearms designed for military use, such as the AK47 and the M16, which may be manually adjusted between automatic and semi-automatic firing modes, are classified as category-A firearms and therefore banned for civilian use.
Certain semi-automatic firearms are now also classified in category A:
semi-automatic short firearms than can hold more than 20 rounds;
semi-automatic long firearms that can hold more than 10 rounds;
semi-automatic long firearms that can be reduced to a length of less than 60 cm without losing functionality by means of a folding or telescoping stock.
Exchange of information
The firearms directive also requires the Commission to adopt delegated acts on setting up an electronic system to exchange information between Member States.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/686 lays down the detailed arrangements for the systematic exchange, by electronic means, of information relating to the transfer of firearms within the EU.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1423 lays down the detailed arrangements for the systematic exchange, by electronic means, of information relating to refusals to grant authorisations to acquire or possess certain firearms.
Cross-border transfer
A person wishing to transfer a firearm from one Member State to another may be granted a licence by the country in which the weapon is located.
Target shooters and other persons authorised to possess a firearm may request a European firearms pass when travelling with their weapon to another Member State.
The European firearms pass should be valid for a maximum of 5 years, which could be extended.

Summary 12:
European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe)
European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1239 establishing a European Maritime Single Window environment
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It introduces an interoperable European Maritime Single Window environment (EMSWe) with harmonised interfaces*, to simplify reporting obligations* for ships arriving at, staying in and departing from EU ports.
It aims to improve the European maritime transport sector’s competitiveness and efficiency by reducing administrative burden, introducing a simplified digital information system to harmonise the existing national systems and reduce the need for paperwork.
KEY POINTS
              
The EMSWe is the legal and technical framework for the electronic transmission of information about reporting obligations for ships calling at EU ports. It is a network of maritime national single windows* with harmonised reporting interfaces and includes data exchanges using SafeSeaNet and other systems, as well as services for:
user registry and access management;
common addressing service;
EMSWe ship database;
common location database;
common hazardous material (‘hazmat’) database; and
ship sanitation database.
Establishing the common EMSWe data set
The regulation maintains the existing maritime national single window in each EU country as the basis for a technologically neutral and interoperable EMSWe.
The European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to establish a new common EMSWe data set, incorporating and adapting the most relevant requirements in existing national or EU legislation. EU countries must notify the Commission of any reporting obligations and requirements stemming from national legislation and any data elements they wish to be included in the EMSWe data set.
Harmonised reporting Interfaces
The Commission will adopt implementing acts laying down the functional and technical specifications for the harmonised reporting interface module for the maritime national single windows, aiming for them to be interoperable with different user technologies and reporting systems.
Once-only principle
The Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (FAL Convention) provides that public authorities must in all cases require only essential reporting information and keep the number of items to a minimum. Under the regulation, EU countries must ensure that ship operators are asked to provide any required information only once per port call, and that relevant supplied data are retained for reuse.
Common services
As components of the EMSW environment, the Commission establishes:
a common access-management and user registry system for declarants and for dataservice providers and national authorities that use the maritime national single window in cases where authentication is required;
an additional and optional common addressing service, provided that the harmonised reporting interface module has been fully implemented;
a ship database containing a list of vessel identification information and characteristics as well as records on ship reporting exemptions;
a common location database containing a reference list of location codes and port facility codes listed in the International Maritime Organization’s Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) database;
a common hazmat database containing a list of dangerous and polluting goods that must be notified;
a common ship sanitation database that is able to receive and store data on maritime declarations of health. This does not include personal data relating to sick passengers or crew;
a multiannual implementation plan, revised annually.
Each EU country designates a competent national authority with a legal mandate to act as a national coordinator for the EMSWe.
The regulation does not affect the exchange of information between customs authorities, or between customs authorities and businesses, using the electronic data-processing techniques referred to in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 (see summary).
Repeal
Regulation (EU) 2019/1239 repeals Directive 2010/65/EU (see summary) as of 15 August 2025.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 15 August 2025.

Electronic road tolls — interoperability of national systems
Electronic road tolls — interoperability of national systems
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/520 — on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems and facilitating cross-border exchange of information on the failure to pay road fees in the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It aims to make the EU electronic road toll rules more effective by:
improving the interoperability of the system under which they operate;
establishing a legal basis for the cross-border exchange of information on vehicles, and their owners or holders, which have failed to pay road fees in the EU.
The directive recasts and repeals Directive 2004/52/EC from 20 October 2021.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive does not apply to:
non-electronic road toll systems;
small, strictly local, road toll systems for which the costs would outweigh the benefits.
European Electronic Toll Service (EETS)
The EETS is the way to achieve an interoperable road toll system.
It enables road users to subscribe to a single contract and to use on-board equipment* to pay electronic tolls across the EU.
It is complementary to national road toll schemes.
The directive sets out the rules for the EETS including:
the general principles, including the procedure for registering EETS providers, and the rights and obligations for EETS providers and toll chargers;
the role of the Conciliation Body, established to mediate between toll chargers and EETS providers;
the provision for ensuring a single continuous service, i.e. once a vehicle’s details have been entered in the system, no further input is required regardless of which EETS providers’ domain the vehicle travels through;
the establishment of a single contact office if an EU country has more than one EETS domain.
Cross-border exchange of information
The directive sets out rules for the exchange of information concerning the failure to pay road tolls including:
the procedure for the exchange of information between EU countries;
the information letter on the failure to pay a road toll;
the provision of information by an EU country to the toll charging body.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It applies from 19 October 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 19 October 2021.
However, the directive also sets out a number of specific deadlines:
19 October 2019 — relating to the Conciliation Body, implementing acts of the European Commission on specifications for electronic interfaces, interoperability constituents, and delegated acts of the Commission on notified bodies;
19 October 2021 — on the availability of national electronic registers;
19 April 2023 — on reporting by the EU countries to the Commission, and by the Commission to the European Parliament and Council;
17 April 2024 — on the Commission's power to adopt delegated acts.
BACKGROUND
              
The EU has also established rules for the sharing of information between EU countries in the case of road traffic offences.
KEY TERMS
              
On-board equipment: the complete set of hardware and software components to be used as part of the toll service which is installed or carried on board a vehicle in order to collect, store, process and remotely receive/transmit data, either as a separate device or installed in the vehicle.

Summary 14:
Immigration liaison officers’ network
Immigration liaison officers’ network
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1240 — creation of a European network of immigration liaison officers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
EU migration policy aims to replace irregular and uncontrolled migration with migration that is safe and well-managed, through a comprehensive approach aimed at ensuring efficient migration management.
The regulation lays down rules aiming to ensure good cooperation, coordination and exchange of information among immigration liaison officers* deployed to non-EU countries by EU countries, the European Commission and EU agencies, through a European network of immigration liaison officers.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation creates a European network of immigration liaison officers to assist in better migration management in order to meet the following EU priorities:
preventing and combating illegal immigration and related cross-border crime, such as migrant smuggling and human trafficking;
carrying out dignified and effective return*, readmission* and reintegration*;
managing legal immigration, including international protection, resettlement, admission procedures and pre-departure integration measures taken by EU countries and the EU.
Local or regional networks of immigration liaison officers
Immigration liaison officers, deployed to the same countries or regions, constitute local or regional cooperation networks. Where necessary and appropriate, they will:
share information and practical experience, including through regular meetings and a secure web-based information exchange platform;
share information regarding access to international protection;
coordinate positions on contacts with commercial carriers;
attend joint specialised training courses, including on fundamental rights, human trafficking, migrant smuggling, document fraud and access to international protection in non-EU countries;
organise information sessions and training courses for diplomatic and consular staff on missions in non-EU countries;
adopt common approaches on methods for collecting and reporting strategically relevant information, including risk analyses;
set up regular contacts with similar networks in the non-EU country and in neighbouring countries.
Tasks of immigration liaison officers
Liaison officers collect information, at operational or strategic level, or both, on:
migration routes;
the existence of criminal organisations involved in migrant smuggling and human trafficking along migration routes;
the methods used to forge or falsify identity documents;
ways to facilitate return, readmission and reintegration;
measures to guarantee effective access to protection put in place by non-EU countries, including for the benefit of vulnerable persons;
existing and possible future legal immigration strategies and channels between the EU and non-EU countries.
Liaison officers can also provide assistance to authorities and other people involved in non-EU countries in the following areas:
establishing the identity and nationality of non-EU nationals and facilitating their return, and helping in reintegration;
identifying persons in need of international protection to facilitate resettlement in the EU, in particular by providing pre-departure information and support where possible;
confirming the identity of legal immigrants and facilitating national and EU measures for their admission;
sharing information within networks of liaison officers and with competent EU national authorities, including law enforcement, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and combat migrant smuggling and human trafficking.
Measures taken by immigration liaison officers, in particular in cases involving vulnerable people, should respect fundamental rights in accordance with relevant international and EU law, including Article 2 and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Steering Board
A Steering Board at EU level is set up to strengthen the management of the network and the coordination of immigration liaison officers, while respecting the existing chain of command and reporting lines between immigration liaison officers and their respective deploying authorities, and among immigration liaison officers themselves.
The Steering Board comprises one representative from each EU country, two from the Commission, and one each from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (also known as Frontex), Europol, and the European Asylum Support Office. Schengen-associated countries will appoint one representative each as members without voting rights.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 14 August 2019. Regulation (EU) 2019/1240 revised and replaced Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 and its subsequent amendments.
BACKGROUND
European Agenda on Migration — Factsheets (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Immigration liaison officer: an officer designated and deployed in a non-EU country, by the competent authorities of an EU country, or by the Commission or by an EU agency, in accordance with their respective laws, to deal with immigration-related issues, including when that is only a part of their duties.
Return: the movement of a person going from a host country back to a country of origin, country of nationality or habitual residence usually after spending a significant period of time in the host country whether voluntary or forced, assisted or spontaneous.
Readmission: act by a country accepting the re-entry of an individual (own national, a non-national of that country or a stateless person).

Summary 16:
European Criminal Records Information System – conviction information on third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN)
European Criminal Records Information System – conviction information on third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/816 setting up a centralised system for the identification of Member States holding conviction information on non-EU nationals and stateless persons (ECRIS-TCN)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It establishes: a system called the European Criminal Records Information System — Third Country Nationals (ECRIS-TCN) to identify the EU Member States which hold information on previous convictions of ‘third-country’ (i.e. non-EU) nationals;the conditions under which national authorities may access ECRIS-TCN in order to obtain information on previous convictions through the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) (Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA — see summary), as well as the conditions under which the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) may use the system;the terms under which ECRIS-TCN helps to facilitate and assist in the correct identification of people registered in ECRIS-TCN.
The regulation has been amended 3 times: by Regulation (EU) 2019/818, which sets up a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration (see summary);by Regulation (EU) 2021/1133, which sets the conditions under which the visa information system, set up under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 (see summary), consults data stored in ECRIS-TCN;by Regulation (EU) 2021/1151, which sets the conditions under which the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 (see summary), consults data stored in ECRIS-TCN.
KEY POINTS
              
The legislation applies to the processing of identity information of non-EU nationals with prior convictions* in one of the Member States, in order to determine which Member State handed down the sentence. It applies equally to EU citizens who also hold non-EU nationality. Information on the conviction itself can only be obtained from the convicting Member State.
The technical architecture of ECRIS-TCN consists of:
a central system which is hosted by the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA);
a national central access point in each Member State;
interface software enabling authorities to connect to the central system;
a communication infrastructure between the central system and national central access points.
National central authorities* create a data record in ECRIS-TCN as quickly as possible for each non-EU national they convict. This contains:
family and first names, date and place of birth, nationality(ies), gender, previous names if applicable and the code of the convicting Member State;
if available, parents’ names, details of the individual’s identity documents and pseudonyms or aliases;
fingerprint data collected according to national law and satisfying certain technical specifications;
facial images, if allowed under the national law of the convicting Member State.
National central authorities shall use ECRIS-TCN to identify the Member State holding criminal record information on a non-EU national, in order to subsequently obtain information on an individual’s previous convictions via ECRIS, when this is required for the purposes of criminal proceedings against that individual or for:
checking a person’s own criminal record at their request;
obtaining a security clearance;
obtaining a licence or permit;
employment vetting;
voluntary activities involving direct and regular contact with children or vulnerable people;
visa, citizenship, migration and asylum procedures;
checks linked to public contracts and public examinations.
The EPPO, Eurojust and Europol:
may access ECRIS-TCN directly to identify the Member States holding criminal records information on a non-EU national;
may not enter, correct or erase any data in ECRIS-TCN;
may request criminal records information from the Member State concerned when a hit* occurs via their own channels;
are responsible for their technical connections to ECRIS-TCN;
shall provide staff with appropriate training, especially on data security, data protection and fundamental rights.
Non-EU countries and international organisations may ask Eurojust for information on which Member States may hold criminal records of a non-EU national concerned, only for the purposes of criminal proceedings. If there is a hit, and the Member State concerned consents, Eurojust shall inform the non-EU country or international organisation on which Member State is concerned, so that they may ask that Member State for the relevant extracts from the criminal records.
Data:
are stored in the central system for as long as they are kept in the national criminal records;
are erased by national authorities when the national retention period expires;
may be modified or erased by the Member States which entered them in the central system;
may only be processed to identify the Member States holding criminal record information of non-EU nationals.
eu-LISA is responsible for:
developing ECRIS-TCN, its operational management and maintaining the ECRIS reference implementation*;
supervising the communication infrastructure, including its security;
maintaining procedures for carrying out quality checks on data stored in ECRIS-TCN and monitoring its functioning and technical maintenance;
submitting regular reports to the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission;
providing the necessary technical training;
applying appropriate rules on professional secrecy and confidentiality;
taking the necessary measures to ensure ECRIS-TCN’s security;
logging all data processing operations in ECRIS-TCN;
giving the Commission monthly statistics on the recording, storage and exchange of information extracted from criminal records through ECRIS-TCN and the ECRIS reference implementation.
Member States are responsible for:
a secure connection between their national criminal records, fingerprint databases and national central access point;
management of duly authorised staff of the central authorities and their training;

Summary 17:
Interoperability between EU information systems in the field of freedom, security and justice
Interoperability between EU information systems in the field of freedom, security and justice
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/817 establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of borders and visa
Regulation (EU) 2019/818 establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
              
They aim to improve checks at the EU’s external borders, allow for better detection of security threats and identity fraud and help in preventing and combating illegal immigration.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The 2 interoperability regulations cover:
3 existing centralised EU information systems for borders and security — the Schengen information system (SIS), the visa information system (VIS) and the European system for the comparison of fingerprints of asylum applicants (Eurodac);
3 centralised EU information systems under development — the Entry/Exit System (EES), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and the European Criminal Records Information System — Third Country Nationals;
data from the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol).
The EU information systems in freedom, security and justice are managed by the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.
Components
The regulations set up the following interoperability components:
a European search portal allowing competent authorities to search multiple information systems simultaneously, using both biographical and biometric data;
a shared biometric matching service enabling the searching and comparing of biometric data (fingerprints and facial images) from several EU information systems;
a common identity repository containing biographical and biometric data of non-EU nationals available in several EU information systems;
a multiple identity detector enabling the detection of multiple identities across different EU information systems.
Access
The regulations do not change the rights of access to the individual EU information systems, but will ease and improve information-sharing.
They provide for a new 2-step approach to grant law enforcement authorities access to the EES, VIS, ETIAS and Eurodac: initial searches would be carried out on a ‘hit/no hit’ basis;if a ‘hit’ were obtained, law enforcement authorities could then access any further information needed, in line with the respective rules and safeguards.
FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
              
They have applied since 11 June 2019.

Renewable energy
Renewable energy
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It recasts and repeals previous legislation (Directive 2009/28/EC, Directive (EU) 2015/1513 and Council Directive 2013/18/EU).
It establishes a common system to promote energy from renewable sources* across the different sectors. In particular, it aims to: set a binding EU target for its share in the energy mix in 2030;regulate self-consumption for the first time; andestablish a common set of rules for the use of renewables in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport in the EU.
The increased use of energy from renewable sources will be crucial to combat climate change, protect our environment and reduce our energy dependency, as well as to contribute to the EU’s technological and industrial leadership and the creation of jobs and growth, including in rural and isolated areas.
KEY POINTS
              
Promoting renewable forms of energy is one of the goals of EU energy policy. The increased use of energy from renewable sources is an important part of the package of measures needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the EU policy framework for climate and energy (2020 to 2030).
This recast directive, along with the revised Energy Efficiency Directive and a new Governance Regulation, is part of the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, which aims to provide new, comprehensive rules on energy regulation for the next decade.
The directive:
ensures that the EU’s binding target is achieved cost-effectively;
establishes a stable, market-oriented European approach to renewable electricity;
provides long-term certainty for investors and speeds up procedures for permits to build projects;
enables consumers to take part in the energy transition with the right to produce their own renewable energy;
increasing the use of renewables in the heating and cooling and the transport sectors;
strengthens EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy.
The directive includes:
a binding EU overall target for 2030 of at least 32% of energy from renewable sources;
rules for cost-effective and market-based financial support for electricity from renewable sources;
protection of support schemes from modifications which put existing projects at risk;
cooperation mechanisms between EU countries, and between EU countries and non-EU countries;
simplification of administrative procedures for renewables projects (including one-stop-shops, time-limits, and digitalisation);
an improved guarantee of origin system, extended to all renewables;
rules allowing consumers to produce their own electricity, individually or as part of renewable energy communities, without undue restrictions;
in the heating and cooling sector: an annual increase of 1.3 percentage points in the share of renewable energy in the sectorthe right for consumers to disconnect from inefficient district heating and cooling systems andthird-party access for suppliers of renewables and waste heat and cooling to district heating and cooling networks;
in the transport sector: a binding target of 14% witha specific sub-target for advanced biofuels of 3.5% andcaps on conventional biofuels and on high indirect land use change risk* biofuels;
strengthened EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy, by extending their scope to cover all fuels produced from biomass regardless of their final energy use.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has applied since 24 December 2018 and has to become law in EU countries by 30 June 2021.
BACKGROUND
              
For more information, see:
Renewable energy (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Energy from renewable sources: energy from renewable non-fossil sources, such as wind, solar (thermal and photovoltaic), aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal, ambient heat, tide, wave and other ocean energy, hydropower, biomass, landfill gas, sewage treatment plant gas and biogases.
Indirect land use change risk: changes in land use are brought about by growing more crops for ethanol or biodiesel production in response to the increased global demand for biofuels. There can be unintended consequences, including releasing more carbon emissions.

Summary 19:
European Electronic Communications Code
European Electronic Communications Code
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
The directive:
establishes a set of updated rules to regulate electronic communications (telecoms) networks, telecoms services, and associated facilities and services;
sets out tasks for national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities, and establishes a set of procedures to ensure that the regulatory framework is harmonised throughout the EU;
aims to stimulate competition and increased investment in 5G* and very high capacity networks, so that every citizen and business in the EU can enjoy high quality connectivity, a high level of consumer protection and an increased choice of innovative digital services.
KEY POINTS
The directive establishes a European Electronic Communications Code, a comprehensive set of new or revised rules for the telecoms sector as part of a package of telecom laws, including Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 establishing the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Agency for Support for BEREC (BEREC Office).
It replaces and repeals Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC and 2002/21/EC, as well as Article 5 of Decision No 243/2012/EU. The review of Directive 2002/58/EC (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) is carried out separately.
General objectives
promote connectivity and take-up of very high capacity networks, including fixed, mobile and wireless networks, for all EU citizens and businesses;
promote the interests of EU citizens by enabling maximum benefits in terms of choice, price and quality through effective competitionmaintaining network and services securityensuring protection for consumers through specific rules andaddressing the needs of specific social groups, in particular people with disabilities, older people and people with special social needs;
facilitate market entry and promote competition in the delivery of telecoms networks and associated facilities;
contribute to the development of the internal market in telecoms networks and services in the EU, by developing common rules and predictable regulation featuring: the effective, efficient and coordinated use of radio spectrum;open innovation;the development of trans-European networks;the availability and interoperability of Europe-wide services; andend-to-end connectivity.
Responsibility of EU countries
cooperate with each other and with the European Commission in the strategic planning and coordination of radio spectrum policy, avoiding harmful interference, through the Radio Spectrum Policy Group;
ensure that tasks set out in the directive are undertaken by a competent authority;
guarantee that national regulatory authorities and other competent authorities are independent of telecoms equipment manufacturers and service providers;
ensure that the national regulatory authorities are protected against external intervention or political pressure which mightjeopardise their independent assessment andhave budget autonomy and adequate financial and human resources to carry out the tasks assigned to them.
New objectives and tasks
In addition to replacing and repealing existing legislation, the directive introduces a series of new objectives and tasks:
Strengthened consumer rules aim to make it easier to switch between service providers and offer better protection, for example, for people who subscribe to bundled services. Consumers will benefit from a similar, higher level of protection across the EU.
Telecoms services now include services provided over the internet which do not use calling numbers, such as messaging apps and email. A review mechanism aims to ensure that consumerrights remain robust and up-to-date as business models and consumer behaviour change.
Affordable and adequate broadband internet access must be available to all consumers, irrespective of their location or income.
People with disabilities should have equivalent access to telecoms services.
EU countries will set up a public warning system to send alerts to citizens on their mobile phones in the event of a natural disaster or other major emergency in their area.
EU countries must provide operators with predictable regulationfor radio spectrum licensing for wireless broadband for at least 20 years to promote investment, in particular in 5G connectivity; increased convergence of national selection procedures through a Peer Review Forum.
New frequency bands for 5G connectivity for faster internet connections and better connectivity, as well as coordinated timing of spectrum licensing and a lighter regulatory regime for small mobile network equipment deployment.
Rules on operator access to networks to encourage competition make it easier for companies to invest in new, very high capacity infrastructure (download speeds of 100 Mbps or more), including in remote areas, while ensuring effective market regulation.
New tools will address issues that may arise in certain market circumstances. Symmetric regulation* will apply to electronic communications network providers in some very specific situations to ensure competition.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It entered into force on 20 December 2018.
Directive (EU) 2018/1972 recasts and replaces Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC and 2002/21/EC (and their subsequent amendments) which had to become law in the EU countries by 2003. The new rules contained in Directive (EU) 2018/1972 apply and have to become law in the EU countries by 21 December 2020

Monitoring and reporting the CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/956 — monitoring and reporting CO2 emissions from, and fuel consumption of, new heavy-duty vehicles
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to:
allow transport companies to make well-informed purchasing decisions by giving them access to standardised information on fuel consumption in order to compare different models of lorries, trucks and buses;
encourage manufacturers to develop more energy-efficient heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs);
enable public authorities to design and implement policies to promote more fuel-efficient heavy-duty vehicles, for instance through taxation and road-user charging.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation applies to heavy-duty vehicles, which include lorries, buses and coaches.
Monitoring and reporting
From 1 January 2019, and for each subsequent calendar year, EU countries must monitor certain registration data for new HDVs registered for the first time in the EU.
From 2020, EU countries must submit such data to the European Commission each year in accordance with a standard reporting procedure.
Manufacturers must also monitor and report each year to the Commission the CO2 and fuel consumption values, as well as additional relevant data, ​​for each new heavy-duty vehicle, as determined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 (known as the Certification Regulation).
The regulation sets out the starting years of monitoring and reporting by manufacturers for each category of HDV.
Central register
The data provided by EU countries and manufacturers will be set out in a publicly accessible central EU register.
Exceptions to public accessibility must be justified by the need to protect private data and to ensure fair competition.
On-road verification tests
The Commission will monitor, where available, the results of on-road tests, performed under Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 — Emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (Euro VI), which are meant to verify that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values determined according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 correctly reflect the performance of HDVs.
Fines
The Commission can impose a fine where it finds that the data reported by the manufacturer does not match the data determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009, or where the data are not submitted within the applicable deadline.
The fine must be effective, proportional and dissuasive and must not exceed €30.000 per heavy-duty vehicle concerned.

Gas supply security in the EU
Gas supply security in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation 2017/1938 aiming to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It aims to strengthen EU energy security by helping prevent potential supply disruptions — and to respond to them when they occur — to ensure that households and other vulnerable consumers are always supplied.
The regulation forms part of the Energy Union package, which aims to make energy secure, affordable and sustainable through closer cooperation between EU countries.
KEY POINTS
              
Gas security of supply is the shared responsibility of natural gas companies, EU countries and the European Commission. The main elements of the regulation are:
better cooperation and coordination between groups of EU countries in regional groups to assess common supply risks together and to develop and agree on joint preventive and emergency measures;
introduction of the solidarity mechanism through which EU countries must help each other to always guarantee gas supply to the most vulnerable consumers — even in severe gas supply situations — under fair compensation conditions by the country receiving solidarity;
improvement of transparency thanks to the obligation placed on gas companies to notify to their national authority their major long-term gas supply contracts that may be relevant for security of supply;
the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOG) will carry out a 4-yearly EU-wide simulation of gas supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios;
EU countries have specific obligations to the Energy Community, with the Commission coordinating the legal rules.
Repeal
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 994/2010.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 November 2017.

Energy consumption: Framework for labelling rules
Energy consumption: Framework for labelling rules
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 on energy labelling
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It sets out the basis for labelling energy-related products, providing standard information about energy efficiency — as well as the consumption of energy and other resources — to help consumers in purchase decisions. It does not cover second-hand products, unless they are imported from outside the EU, or means of transport.
It repeals Directive 2010/30/EU.
KEY POINTS
              
All energy-related products will display labels on a new, updated and clearer scale from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). This system will replace the previous system of A+++ to G labels, which is less effective because of the development of more energy-efficient products. There is also a requirement for a product information sheet.
Labels already in use before 1 August 2017 will be rescaled by the European Commission, i.e. recalibrated to conform with the new regulation.
The Commission adopts a separate delegated act for each specific product group to supplement the regulation. This establishes detailed requirements for labelling of specific product groups where:
the product group has significant potential for energy saving;
within the product group, equivalent models have significantly different levels of performance;
there is no significant negative impact in terms of affordability or the overall costs of the product group.
Delegated acts relating to specific product groups specify, among other things:
the specific product group which is to be covered by the detailed labelling requirements;
the design and content of the label, including a scale showing consumption of energy consisting of A to G, which should have a uniform design across product groups;
other information emphasising the energy efficiency of the product;
where appropriate, a reference in the label identifying products that are energy smart, i.e. capable of adapting and optimising consumption patterns;
the measurement and calculation methods to be used to determine label and product information, including the definition of the energy efficiency index (EEI);
the evaluation date and possible revision date of the delegated act;
differences in energy performances in different climatic regions.
The supplier and dealer responsibilities are to:
display the energy efficiency class of the product and the range of classes available on the label;
cooperate with market surveillance authorities and take immediate action to remedy any non-compliance;
for products covered by delegated acts, not display other information likely to mislead customers about energy consumption;
for products not covered by delegated acts, or non-energy related products, not display labels which mimic those under this regulation.
Dealers, including online dealers, must display the label provided by the supplier and make available to customers the product information sheet at the point of sale.
The Commission will establish a product registration database:
to support market surveillance authorities in carrying out their tasks, including enforcement;
to provide the public with information about products, their energy labels and product information sheets;
to provide the Commission with up-to-date energy efficiency information to review energy labelling.
The database will allow the public to consult product labels and information sheets, making it easier to compare the energy efficiency of household appliances.
The regulation also requires manufacturers to inform consumers if software or firmware (software that is embedded in a piece of hardware and serves as the interface between that hardware and the operating system, e.g. on a smartphone or computer) updates could reduce a product’s energy efficiency. It bans the use of ‘defeat devices’, which alter a product’s performance under test conditions.
By 2 August 2025, the Commission will assess the implementation of this regulation and submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 August 2017, except for the obligations of suppliers in relation to the product database which apply from 1 January 2019.

General data protection regulation (GDPR)
General data protection regulation (GDPR)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The general data protection regulation (GDPR) protects individuals when their data is being processed by the private sector and most of the public sector. The processing of data by the relevant authorities for law-enforcement purposes is subject to the data protection law enforcement directive (LED) instead (see summary).
It allows individuals to better control their personal data. It also modernises and unifies rules, allowing businesses to reduce red tape and to benefit from greater consumer trust.
It establishes a system of completely independent supervisory authorities in charge of monitoring and enforcing compliance.
It is part of the European Union (EU) data protection reform, along with the data protection law enforcement directive and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (see summary).
KEY POINTS
Individuals’ rights
The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives individuals more control over their personal data. It includes the following.
Easier access to an individual's own data. This includes providing more information on how that data is processed and ensuring that that information is available in a clear and understandable way.
A new right to data portability. This makes it easier to transmit personal data between service providers.
A clearer right to erasure (right to be forgotten). When an individual no longer wants their data to be processed and there is no legitimate reason to keep it, the data will be deleted.
The right to know when their personal data has been breached. Companies and organisations have to notify the relevant data protection supervisory authority and, in cases of serious data breaches, also the individuals affected.
Rules for businesses
The GDPR creates a level playing field for all companies operating in the EU internal market, adopts a technology-neutral approach and stimulates innovation through a number of steps, which include the following.
A single set of EU-wide rules. A single EU-wide law for data protection increases legal certainty and reduces administrative burden.
A data protection officer. A person responsible for data protection has to be designated by public authorities and by businesses that process data on a large scale, or whose core activity is the processing of special categories of data, such as health-related data.
One-stop shop. Businesses only have to deal with one single supervisory authority (in the EU Member State in which they have their main establishment); the relevant supervisory authorities cooperate in the framework of the European Data Protection Board for cross-border cases.
EU rules for non-EU companies. Companies based outside the EU must apply the same rules when offering services or goods to, or when monitoring the behaviours of, individuals within the EU.
Innovation-friendly rules. A guarantee that data protection safeguards are built into products and services from the earliest stage of development (data protection by design and by default).
Privacy-friendly techniques. Pseudonymisation (when identifying fields within a data record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers) and encryption (when data is coded in such a way that only authorised parties can read it), for example, are encouraged, in order to limit the intrusiveness of processing.
Removal of notifications. The GDPR scrapped most notification obligations and the costs associated with these. One of its aims is to remove obstacles that affect the free flow of personal data within the EU. This will make it easier for businesses to expand in the single digital market.
Data protection impact assessments. Organisations will have to carry out impact assessments when data processing may result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals.
Record keeping. Small and medium-sized enterprises are not required to keep records of processing activities – unless the processing is regular or likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the person whose data is being processed, or includes sensitive categories of data.
A modern toolbox for international data transfers. The GDPR offers various instruments to transfer data outside the EU, including adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission where the non-EU country offers an adequate level of protection, pre-approved (standard) contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, codes of conduct and certification.
Review
The Commission submitted a report on the evaluation and review of the regulation in June 2020. The next evaluation is due in 2024.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
The GDPR has applied since 25 May 2018.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/792 — harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It lays down a common set of rules for developing, producing and disseminating harmonised national and EU indices of consumer and house prices.
KEY POINTS
The legislation applies to the following: the harmonised index of consumer prices* (HICP);the harmonised index of consumer prices at constant tax rates (HICP-CT);the harmonised price index for owner-occupied housing (OOH);the harmonised house price index (HPI).
EU countries’ national authorities: provide the European Commission’s statistical office, Eurostat, with the harmonised indices;update the product category weightings for the indices every year.
Any changes in the prices of dwellings purchased by households or of other products that households buy in their capacity as owner occupiers of dwellings are included in the OOH but excluded from the HICP and HICP-CT.
Furthermore, data for the following are not included in the HICP and HICP-CT: narcotics;gambling;prostitution;life insurance;financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) — the value of financial intermediation services is provided, but not directly charged for, by financial institutions.
The Commission may adopt further measures, provided these do not impose a significant additional burden on national authorities, to ensure the comparable harmonised indices are produced under uniform conditions. These cover: sampling and representativity;collection and treatment of prices;replacements and quality adjustment;index compilation;revisions;special indices;treatment of products* in specific areas.
National authorities provide Eurostat with HICP and HICP-CT data every month and with the HPI and OOH data every quarter.
The harmonised indices and subindices are adjusted to a new common index reference when a major methodological change takes place, or every 10 years from 2015.
The Commission had to prepare a report on the integration of the OOH price index into the HICP coverage by 31 December 2018.
The Commission had to prepare a report on the use of delegated powers by 13 September 2020.
Implementing act
In 2020, the Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1148, which lays down the methodological and technical specifications in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/792 as regards harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index. The regulation:
establishes uniform conditions for producing: the HICP and the HICP-CT andthe OOH price index and the HPI;
integrates the relevant rules from — and repeals — Regulations (EC) No 1749/96, (EC) No 2214/96, (EC) No 1687/98, (EC) No 2646/98, (EC) No 1617/1999, (EC) No 2166/1999, (EC) No 2601/2000, (EC) No 2602/2000, (EC) No 1920/2001, (EC) No 1921/2001, (EC) No 1708/2005, (EC) No 701/2006, (EC) No 330/2009, (EU) No 1114/2010 and (EU) No 93/2013, adopted on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 (which Regulation (EU) 2016/792 also replaces and repeals).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
Regulation (EU) 2016/792 has applied since 13 June 2016. It was used for the first time for January 2017 data.
BACKGROUND
The HICP measures inflation rates at national and EU level. The Commission and the European Central Bank use the index to assess price stability in EU countries and in the euro area.
High-quality comparable price statistics are essential for those responsible for public policy in the EU, researchers and all EU citizens.

Anti-dumping measures
Anti-dumping measures
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 on protection against dumped imports from non-EU countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 sets out the EU’s trade defence rules to protect against imports from non-EU countries dumped on the EU market.
It has been amended three times: by Regulation (EU) 2017/2321, by Regulation (EU) 2018/825 and by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173.
KEY POINTS
              
Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 lays down the following rules.
Conditions
Four conditions must be met before anti-dumping measures can be imposed on imports of a product:
the imports must be dumped — if a product’s export price to the EU is less than its normal value*;
there must be material injury* to the EU industry producing the like product*;
there must be a causal link between the dumped imports and the material injury; and
the anti-dumping measure* must not be against the EU interest — the measures should not cause more harm to its overall economy than the relief brought to the industry suffering from the imports.
Initiating a complaint
An anti-dumping complaint is filed with the European Commission by or on behalf of the EU producers of the product concerned either directly or via the authorities of an EU country. Trade unions may also submit complaints jointly with the EU industry and become interested parties in the proceedings. In special circumstances, the Commission may also open an investigation into dumping on its own initiative.
Any complaint must include evidence of dumping, injury and a causal link between the allegedly dumped imports and the alleged injury.
To protect confidential business data, two versions of a complaint need to be lodged: a confidential version and a non-confidential version. The first will be available only to Commission staff directly working on the case. The non-confidential version will be accessible by all interested parties once the investigation is opened.
The Commission must examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the complaint to determine whether there is a sufficient basis to justify initiating an investigation. This must be done within 45 days of the complaint being lodged.
Anti-dumping investigation
Once the Commission decides to launch an investigation, it must publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. It contacts all known manufacturers and all other interested parties requesting them to complete questionnaires by a strict deadline.
Where there are many potentially interested parties, the Commission may decide to carry out its investigation on the basis of a sample of operators (exporting producers, EU manufacturers, importers, users).
Under the original Regulation (EU) 2016/1036, investigations could take 9 months before the Commission could impose provisional measures based on its provisional findings.
A finding of dumping
The following can take place where, based on its investigation, the Commission considers that dumping has occurred.
Anti-dumping measures may be imposed on imports of the product concerned into the EU, which generally take the form of: an ad valoremduty — a percentage of the import value of the product concerned;specific duties — a fixed value for a certain amount of goods, e.g. €100 per tonne of a product; ora price undertaking — a commitment by an exporter to respect minimum import prices.
Provisional measures, where the Commission imposes them, are for a maximum of 6 months. This may be followed by definitive measures which remain in force for 5 years.
The duties are paid by the importer in the EU and collected by the national customs authorities of the EU countries concerned.
Measures in force may be reviewed (interim review) under certain conditions. The scope of this review is usually limited to one or various elements of the initial measures, e.g. the level of dumping and/or injury, the product scope, or the form of the measures.
After 5 years, the measures lapse unless an expiry review concludes that, if the measures were to expire, dumping and material injury would likely continue or recur.
Importers may request a full or partial refund of duties paid if they can show that the dumping margin*, on the basis of which the duties were paid, has been eliminated or reduced.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2321 introduces a dumping calculation methodology to be used in cases concerning imports from World Trade Organization member countries where significant market distortions exist as a result of state intervention.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825
Among other things, the regulation does the following.
It shortened the period of time for the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures, if any, from 9 months after initiation to 7 months, with the possibility of extending the period to 8 months.
It makes it easier for smaller businesses to participate in trade defence investigations (including a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) trade defence helpdesk, creating a dedicated SME webpage and publishing a guide for SMEs).
It amends how the rule known as the ‘lesser duty rule’ is applied in anti-dumping cases. The EU could previously only impose measures at a level lower than the full extent of the dumping, where a lower level (the ‘injury margin’) was sufficient to remove the injury suffered by the EU industry. Under the new rules, anti-dumping measures can be imposed at the full level of dumping where there is evidence of significant distortions in the exporting market for relevant raw materials used in the manufacture of the product concerned and provided this is in the interest of the EU as a whole to do so.
It introduces new rules on calculating the ‘non-injurious price’ (the price that the industry is expected to have charged under normal circumstances). The calculation may now take into account the cost of necessary investments, for example, in infrastructure or research and development, but also future expenses related to social and environmental standards, for example under the EU’s emission trading system. The non-injurious price now assumes a minimum profit of 6% that will be included in the calculation, with a higher profit margin possible on a case-by-case basis.
It introduces a pre-disclosure period, during which interested parties received information on the imposition, or not, of provisional measures 3 weeks in advance with an obligation for the Commission to review, by 9 June 2020, whether a substantial rise in imports had occurred during the 3-week period of pre-disclosure and whether, if such a rise had occurred, it had caused additional injury to the EU industries concerned.
It introduces the repayment of duties collected while an expiry review is ongoing if the review results in the termination of the measures.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173
In the review carried out in line with amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825, the Commission concluded that, overall, no additional injury to the EU industry had been caused by the imports during the pre-disclosure period. It therefore adopted a delegated act amending the duration of the period of pre-disclosure to 4 weeks.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
It has applied since 20 July 2016. Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 codified and replaced Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and its subsequent amendments.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2321 has applied since 20 December 2017.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825 has applied since 8 June 2018.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173 has applied since 11 August 2020.

KEY TERMS
              
Normal value: generally considered to be the market price for the product in the exporting country. However, if there are no sales, only a low volume of sales, or if sales are being made at a loss on the home market, the normal value of the product is usually calculated based on the cost of production in the exporting country plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs, and profit. Specific rules exist for economies subject to significant distortions.
Material injury: substantial injury to EU industry, e.g. loss of market share, reduced price levels and/or reduced profitability.
Like product: a product which is identical to or closely resembles the imported product under consideration.
Anti-dumping measures: measures imposed on imports of a product that are being sold at a price lower than the normal value of the product and which cause material injury to EU producers.
Dumping margin: the difference between the normal value and the price that the same exporter charges for that product on the EU market (export price).

Anti-subsidy measures
Anti-subsidy measures
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 on protection against subsidised imports from non-EU countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 sets out EU rules on the protection against subsidised imports from non-EU countries and the conditions for the application of countervailing measures.
It has been amended three times: by Regulation (EU) 2017/2321, by Regulation (EU) 2018/825 and by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173.
KEY POINTS
Regulation (EU) 2016/1037
A countervailing duty is applied to counteract the injurious effects of the subsidised imports of a product on the EU producers of the same product market and to restore fair competition. The duty is paid by the importer and collected by the customs authorities of the EU country concerned.
Four conditions must be met before anti-subsidy measures can be imposed on imports of a product:
the imports benefit from a specific subsidy;
there must be material injury* to the EU industry producing the like product*;
there must be a causal link between the subsidised imports and the material injury; and
the anti-subsidy measure must not be against EU interest — the measures should not cause more harm to its overall economy than the relief brought to the industry suffering from the imports.
Initiating a complaint
An anti-subsidy complaint is filed with the European Commission by or on behalf of the EU producers of the product concerned either directly or via the authorities of an EU country. Other parties, such as trade unions, may also submit complaints jointly with the EU industry and become interested parties in the proceedings. In special circumstances, the Commission may also open an investigation into subsidies on its own initiative.
Any complaint must include evidence of subsidy, injury and a causal link between the allegedly subsidised imports and the alleged injury.
To protect confidential business data, two versions of a complaint need to be lodged: a confidential version and a non-confidential version. The first will be available only to Commission staff directly working on the case. The non-confidential version will be accessible by all interested parties once the investigation is opened, upon request.
The Commission must examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the complaint to determine whether there is a sufficient basis to justify initiating an investigation. This must be done within 45 days of the complaint being lodged.
Prior to initiating an anti-subsidy investigation, the Commission is required to offer consultations to the government of the exporting country.
Anti-subsidy investigation
Once the Commission decides to launch an investigation, it must publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. It contacts all known manufacturers and all other interested parties requesting them to complete questionnaires by a strict deadline.
Where there are many potentially interested parties, the Commission may decide to carry out its investigation on the basis of a sample of operators (exporting producers, EU manufacturers, importers, users).
Where, based on its investigation, the Commission considers that subsidisation causing injury has occurred, anti-subsidy measures may be imposed on imports into the EU of the product concerned. These measures generally take the form of: an ad valorem duty — a percentage of the import value of the product concerned;specific duties — a fixed value for a certain amount of goods, e.g. €100 per tonne of a product; ora price undertaking — a commitment by an exporter to respect minimum import prices.
The authorities of the exporting country can also undertake to eliminate the subsidy or take measures concerning the effects of the subsidy.
Provisional measures, if any, must be imposed no later than 9 months after the investigation has begun and must remain in place for a maximum of 4 months. This may be followed by the imposition of definitive measures, which remain in force for 5 years.
Duties are paid by the importer in the EU and are collected by the national customs authorities of the EU countries concerned.
Measures in force may be reviewed (interim review) under certain conditions. The scope of this review is usually limited to one or various elements of the initial measures, e.g. the level of subsidisation and/or injury, the product scope, or the form of the measures.
After 5 years, the measures lapse unless an expiry review concludes that, if the measures were to expire, subsidisation and material injury would likely continue or recur.
Importers may request a full or partial refund of duties paid if they can show that the subsidy margin, on the basis of which the duties were paid, has been eliminated or reduced.
The EU’s anti-subsidy rules are based on the global standards set by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2321
As experience showed that some subsidies are only discovered during the relevant investigation, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2321 added a subparagraph requiring the Commission, in those situations, to offer additional consultations regarding these subsidies to the country of origin and/or of export concerned with regard to such subsidies identified in the course of the investigation.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825
Among other things, the regulation does the following.
It streamlines the investigation process and makes it easier for smaller businesses to participate in trade defence investigations (including the creation of a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) trade defence helpdesk).
It amends how the rule known as the ‘lesser duty rule’ is applied in anti-subsidy cases. The EU had previously imposed measures at a level lower than the full extent of the subsidisation, where a lower level (the ‘injury margin’) was sufficient to remove the injury suffered by the EU industry. Under the new rules, anti-subsidy measures can fully offset the subsidies that an exporter has received, provided this is in the interest of the EU as a whole to do so.
It introduces new rules on calculating the ‘non-injurious price’ (the price that the industry is expected to have charged under normal circumstances). The calculation may now take into account the cost of necessary investments, for example in infrastructure or research and development, but also future expenses related to social and environmental standards, for example under the EU’s emission trading system. The non-injurious price now assumes a minimum profit of 6% that will be included in the calculation, with a higher profit margin possible on a case-by-case basis.
It introduced a pre-disclosure period, during which interested parties received information on the imposition, or not, of provisional measures 3 weeks in advance. In the review carried out in line with amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825, the Commission concluded that, overall, no additional injury to the EU industry had been caused by the imports during the pre-disclosure period. It therefore adopted a delegated act amending the duration of the period of pre-disclosure to 4 weeks (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 has applied since 20 July 2016. It codified and replaced Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 and its subsequent amendments.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2321 has applied since 20 December 2017.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2018/825 has applied since 8 June 2018.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1173 has applied since 11 August 2020.
BACKGROUND
A subsidy is a financial contribution, such as a grant or a loan, usually paid by the government of a non-EU country. It confers benefit to a business or industry exporting its products into the EU, thus distorting competition in the EU market. To counteract this distortion and restore fair competition, the EU may impose countervailing duties on such imports.
The EU’s anti-subsidy rules are based on the global standards set by the WTO.
For more information, see: Anti-subsidy (European Commission)Notice: On the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations.
KEY TERMS
              
Material injury: substantial injury to EU industry, e.g. loss of market share, reduced price levels and/or reduced profitability.
Like product: a product which is identical to or closely resembles the imported product under consideration.

InvestEU Programme (2021-2027)
InvestEU Programme (2021-2027)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/523 establishing the InvestEU Programme
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes the InvestEU programme comprising 3 building blocks:
the InvestEU Fund, providing an EU guarantee to support financing of and investment in internal EU policies;
the InvestEU Advisory Hub, supporting project development, access to finance and capacity-building assistance;
the InvestEU Portal, giving visibility to projects seeking finance and information on investment opportunities.
KEY POINTS
              
The InvestEU programme’s general aim is to support financing that contributes to:
competitiveness, including research, innovation and digitisation;
economic growth, sustainability and employment;
social resilience, inclusiveness and innovation;
scientific and technological advancement, including culture, education and training;
the integration of capital markets and a stronger internal market;
economic, social and territorial cohesion;
sustainable and inclusive recovery of the EU economy, including capital support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), after the Covid-19 crisis.
The programme uses 4 specific policy areas (through 4 dedicated ‘windows’), each with specific EU and national parts (‘compartments’) to address market failures or suboptimal investment situations:
sustainable infrastructure ranging from transport, energy and digital connectivity to the circular economy and innovative technologies;
research, innovation and digitisation, including product development and support for market enablers;
financing for SMEs, including innovative companies and those in the cultural and creative sectors;
social investment and skills covering microfinance, social enterprises, health, gender equality, education, training and other social services.
These are supported by:
a just transition scheme with investments to address the social, economic and environmental challenges of meeting the EU’s 2030 climate targets and 2050 goal of climate neutrality (see summary);
strategic investments in important projects of common European interest, such as defence, space, cybersecurity, the green transition, the digital transition and strengthening strategic value chains.
InvestEU has a budgetary guarantee of €26.2 billion (in current prices) funded by NextGenerationEU resources and the multiannual financial framework (2021-2027).
The guarantee can be increased by contributions from EU Member States and non-EU countries. It is split as follows:
€14.8 billion for measures to support the post-Covid-19 economic recovery under the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility set up under Regulation (EU) 2021/241 (see summary);
€11.3 billion for the 4 specific policy areas listed above.
The European Commission and the European Investment Bank Group (EIBG) form a partnership under which the EIBG has specific tasks, to:
support the implementation of the InvestEU programme;
foster its consistency, inclusivity, additionality* and efficient deployment.
Other national promotional banks and institutions and international financial institutions can take part in the programme.
The Commission will:
select implementing partners* in addition to the EIB;
conclude a guarantee agreement with each partner covering items such as the amount and terms of the financial contribution, payment conditions and key performance indicators.
To qualify for InvestEU Fund support, financing and investment operations must:
comply with various conditions set out in the EU’s Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — see summary);
contribute to the EU’s policy objectives and be an eligible area under Annex II (energy, transport infrastructure, environment and resources, digital connectivity, research, development and innovation, digital technologies, SMEs, cultural and creative sectors, tourism, rehabilitation of industrial sites, sustainable land and water use, bioeconomy, social investment, defence, space, seas and oceans);
not feature on the list of excluded activities in Annex V (B), such as gambling, tobacco, real estate, oil, fossil fuels or violations of human rights;
be consistent with the investment guidelines.
The InvestEU Fund may also support projects and operations in non-EU countries subject to certain conditions.
The EU guarantee:
may be used towards risk coverage for various types of financing (loans, guarantees, capital market instruments or other forms of credit) provided by the implementing partners;
covers for debt: all outstanding principal and interest due to the implementing partner, restructuring losses and losses from currency fluctuations, apart from the euroequity or quasi-equity investments: amounts invested and associated funding costs and losses from currency fluctuations, apart from the eurofunding or guarantees by an implementing partner to another financial institution: amounts used and associated costs.
The regulation establishes a governance structure which consists of the following.
The Advisory Board meets at least twice a year and advises the Commission and the Steering Board on the design of financial products, market developments, conditions and failures and suboptimal investments.
The Steering Board provides strategic and operational guidance for the implementing partners, applies the Commission’s risk methodological framework and oversees the implementation of the InvestEU programme.
The Scoreboard contains various indicators that implementing partners provide, such as a description of the proposed financing and impact of the investment, so the Investment Committee can carry out an independent, transparent and harmonised assessment of requests for use of the EU guarantee.
The Investment Committee is a fully independent body of experts that examines the financing and investment proposals submitted under the 4 ‘windows’ and checks whether they meet the regulation’s conditions and whether they would benefit from support under the EU guarantee.
Policy checks are carried out by the Commission to confirm proposed financing and investment operations from implementing partners, apart from the EIB, comply with EU law and policies.
The InvestEU Advisory Hub, established by the Commission:
provides advisory support to identify, prepare, develop, structure, procure and implement investment projects;
helps project promoters and intermediaries to implement their financing and investment activities;
acts as a central point of entry, managed by the Commission, for project development assistance for public authorities and project promoters, including additional information on investment guidelines;
is available to public and private project promoters, including SMEs and start-ups, public authorities, national promotional banks and institutions and financial and non-financial intermediaries.
The InvestEU Portal, established by the Commission:
is an easily accessible and user-friendly database providing relevant information for each project;
provides a channel for promoters seeking finance to make their projects visible to potential investors.
The regulation establishes accountability, monitoring, evaluation and transparency requirements as follows.
Accountability. The European Parliament or the Council may ask the Chairperson of the Steering Board to report on the InvestEU Fund’s performance and reply orally or in writing to questions.
Monitoring and reporting. Annex III contains a detailed list of key performance and monitoring indicators. Implementing partners use these in their 6-monthly reports to the Commission, which in turn reports annually on the InvestEU programme’s performance. The EIB reports annually on investment barriers.
Evaluation. The Commission: will submit an interim evaluation report on the programme to the European Parliament and the Council by 30 September 2024will present the 2 institutions with its final evaluation report, in particular on use of the EU guarantee, by 31 December 2031 at the latest. It will also send its conclusions to the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions.
Transparency. Implementing and advisory partners must acknowledge EU funding by providing targeted information to multiple audiences, including the media and the public. The Commission organises information and communication activities.
The regulation:
gives the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts;
amends Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 on the European Fund for Strategic Investments (see summary).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2021.
BACKGROUND
The InvestEU programme brings under one umbrella many different forms of EU financing. This makes funding for investment projects simpler, more efficient and more flexible and helps meet the EU’s twin goals of a green transition and digital transformation.
The EU guarantee is used to leverage substantial private and public long-term funds to contribute to Europe’s economic and social recovery by aligning investors with EU policy priorities.
Member States may use InvestEU to implement their national plans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility.
It is estimated the guarantee could mobilise total investment across the EU of over €372 billion by 2027, of which 30% will go towards climate policies.
The InvestEU programme builds on the successful model of the investment plan for Europe, known as the Juncker Plan, which mobilised more than €500 billion between 2015 and 2020.
For more information, see:
InvestEU (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Additionality: under EFSI (the European Fund for Strategic Investments), this term means support for operations which address market failures or suboptimal investment situations and which could not have been carried out in the period during which the EU guarantee can be used, or not to the same extent, by the EIB Group or under existing EU financial instruments without EFSI support.
Implementing partner: an eligible counterpart, such as a national or international financial institution or promotional bank with whom the Commission has concluded an agreement.

EU Recovery and Resilience Facility
EU Recovery and Resilience Facility
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes a Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) for the European Union (EU) and sets out the facility’s aims and the criteria for receiving funding.
KEY POINTS
              
The RRF aims to promote the EU’s economic, social and territorial cohesion by:
improving EU Member States’ resilience, crisis preparedness, adjustment capacity and growth potential;
mitigating the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, particularly on women;
contributing to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights;
supporting the green transition (see summary) and helping to achieve the EU’s 2030 climate targets and 2050 climate neutrality objective;
encouraging the digital transition.
RRF funding is available for measures which ‘do no significant harm’, i.e. that do not harm the environment, and do not involve recurrent expenditure, in the following six pillars:
the green transition;
the digital transformation;
smart, sustainable and inclusive growth;
social and territorial cohesion;
health, economic, social and institutional resilience;
policies for the next generation, such as education and skills.
The €723.8 billion (in current prices) budget:
consists of: €338 billion in grants, of which the European Commission may allocate 70% up to 31 December 2022 and 30% during 2023,€385.8 billion in loans, which Member States may request until 31 August 2023 (a loan may not exceed 6.8% of the Member State’s 2019 gross national income);
does not replace recurring national budgetary expenditure, except in justified cases;
supplements financial support under other EU programmes;
respects the additionality principle* of EU funding.
The economic governance rules state that:
the Commission may propose suspending all or part of the funding to a Member State if the Council of the European Union decides it has not done enough to correct its excessive deficit;
a proposal to suspend commitments* is adopted unless the Council rejects it by a qualified majority within 1 month;
a proposal to suspend payments* requires the Council’s approval;
suspension of funding must be proportionate and take account of a Member State’s economic and social circumstances;
the Council may lift a suspension following a Commission proposal.
Member States draw up national recovery and resilience plans, setting out their reform and investment agenda in a comprehensive and coherent package. These:
may include measures from 1 February 2020;
have to be consistent with: national challenges and priorities identified in the European semester,national reform programmes,national energy and climate plans,territorial ‘Just Transition’ plans,‘Youth Guarantee’ implementation plans;
must allocate at least 37% of the budget to climate measures, and 20% to digital measures.
The Commission:
assesses the plans according to their relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and coherence;
if it proposes that the Council approves a national plan, sets out the milestones and targets that a country must meet in its reforms and investment projects, and the RRF’s financial contribution;
may reject or accept amendments to the plans;
transmits the national plans to the European Parliament and the Council without delay;
monitors the facility’s implementation and measures the achievements made;
establishes a recovery and resilience scoreboard;
submits annual reports to the European Parliament and the Council.
Member States:
must prevent, detect and correct any fraud, corruption or conflict of interest when using EU funds;
report twice a year on the progress of their plans in the context of the European semester.
The relevant European Parliament committee may invite the Commission every 2 months to discuss progress under the facility.
The Commission submits reports to the European Parliament and the Council:
a review report by 31 July 2022;
on the RRF’s overall implementation by 20 February 2024 (also goes to the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions).
Recovery and resilience scoreboard
In December 2021, the Commission launched the recovery and resilience scoreboard, a public online platform which is designed to show progress made in the implementation of the RRF as a whole, and of the individual national recovery and resilience plans.
Delegated act
In defining a methodology for reporting social expenditure, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2105 supplements Regulation (EU) 2021/241. The methodology for reporting social expenditure, including on children and the youth, and on gender equality under the facility is based on the estimated expenditure provided in the approved recovery and resilience plans.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?

EU rail passengers’ rights
EU rail passengers’ rights
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/782 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to provide significantly improved protection to rail passengers in the event of travel disruptions.
It also aims to respond better to the needs of persons with disabilities or reduced mobility.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies to international or domestic rail journeys throughout the European Union (EU) provided by one or more railway companies. It includes a number of new and important features.
Through-tickets. A new obligation for carriers qualifying as a ‘sole railway undertaking’* to offer their long-distance (international and domestic) and regional rail services as a through-ticket.
Real-time travel information. Infrastructure managers shall distribute real-time traffic data to railway undertakings, ticket vendors, tour operators and station managers. Railway companies must provide real-time dynamic travel information to other railway companies selling their tickets, as well as to ticket vendors and tour operators.
Right to self-routing. Where passengers have not been offered a timely solution (within 100 minutes) in the event of a disruption to their journey, they can themselves organise alternative public transportation by rail or bus, and be reimbursed by the carrier for the ‘necessary, appropriate and reasonable’ cost of the additional ticket.
Transporting bicycles. Dedicated spaces for assembled (not merely folding) bicycles will be required on new trains and on those which have had major upgrades.
Persons with disabilities or reduced mobility. Reduces the pre-notification period for assistance requests to 24 hours along with a number of other measures.
Enforcing passengers’ rights. Introduces an improved enforcement framework including: an amended complaint-handling mechanism;a reinforced obligation for cooperation between the national enforcement bodies;a standardised EU-wide form allowing passengers to request reimbursement or compensation.
Force majeure clause. Railway undertakings do not have to pay compensation for delays or cancellation in the case of extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic or extreme weather conditions.
Equal treatment. Discrimination based on the passenger’s nationality or the place of establishment within the EU of the carrier or the ticket vendor and tour operator is prohibited.
Major disruptions. In coordination with infrastructure and station managers, railway undertakings should prepare contingency plans (including accessible alert and information systems) to prepare for the possibility of major disruption and long delays causing a considerable number of passengers to be stranded in a station.
Exemptions. Previously existing exemptions are curtailed and no rail services are per se exempted. Certain exemptions can still be granted by EU Member States, such as for urban, suburban and regional passenger services, to which an increased number of mandatory provisions would then remain applicable.

Protection of persons who report breaches of EU law
Protection of persons who report breaches of EU law
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It establishes rules and procedures to protect ‘whistleblowers’, individuals who report* information they acquired in a work-related context on breaches* of EU law in key policy areas. Breaches include both unlawful acts or omissions and abusive practices.
KEY POINTS
              
The directive covers reports on:
breaches of rules in the following areas (listed in detail in Part I of the annex) public procurementfinancial services, products and markets; prevention of money laundering and terrorist financingproduct safety and compliancetransport safety in the railway, road, maritime and inland waters sectorsprotection of the environment, ranging from waste management to chemicalsradiation protection and nuclear safetyfood and feed safety, animal health and welfarepublic health, including patients’ rights and tobacco controlsconsumer protectionprotection of privacy and personal data, security and information systems;
breaches affecting the EU’s financial interests;
breaches relating to the internal market, including breaches of EU competition and State aid rules, and breaches of national corporate tax rules.
The directive complements specific EU legislation which already includes rules on whistleblowing (notably on financial services, money laundering, terrorist financing, transport safety and environmental protection).
The directive does not:
affect the responsibility of EU governments to protect their national security;
affect EU or national law on protection of classified information, legal and medical professional privilege, secrecy of judicial proceedings or criminal procedural rule;
override national rules on rights of employees to consult their representatives or trade unions.
The legislation covers a wide range of people working in the private and public sectors, including those who report after their work-based relationship has ended:
employees, self-employed people, shareholders, persons belonging to the administrative, management and supervisory bodies of businesses, volunteers, trainees and job applicants;
persons who help whistleblowers in a confidential manner, persons connected to a whistleblower who might suffer retaliation* at work, and legal entities linked to the whistleblower.
Individuals are protected if they go public with their concerns provided they:
first reported (internally and) externally but no action was taken;
reasonably believe that there is an imminent or clear danger to the public interest, a risk of retaliation or little likelihood of their concern being properly addressed.
Reporting arrangements include:
internal channels: all private companies with 50 or more employees and, in principle, all public entities must set up effective reporting channels, ensuring confidentiality; public entities with less than 50 employees and municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants may be exempted;
external channels: appropriate national authorities must establish reporting channels enabling confidential reporting;
follow-up procedures and deadlines for handling reports received through internal and external channels. These include a duty not to reveal the whistleblower’s identity, except in strictly limited circumstancescompliance with EU data protection legislationrecords of every oral or written report received.
Legal protection
To qualify for legal protection, an individual must:
have reasonable grounds to believe that the information they report is covered by the legislation and true at the time of reporting;
report the breach to the competent authorities use the internal or external channels provided. Whistleblowers are encouraged to report internally (within the organisation) first, where the breach can be addressed effectively internally and where they consider that there is no risk of retaliation. However, they can choose whether to report first internally or to directly report externally to the competent authorities.
Whistleblowers:
are protected against all forms of retaliation, such as dismissal, demotion, intimidation and blacklisting;
have access to appropriate support measures, notably independent information and advice and legal aid in accordance with EU rules on legal aid in criminal and cross-border civil proceedings;
have access to appropriate remedial measures, such as interim relief and immunity from liability for breaching non-disclosure clauses in their contracts.
EU countries must:
ensure appropriate internal and external reporting channels are in place;
take the necessary measures to prevent any retaliation against a whistleblower;
respect the right to an effective remedy, a fair trial, presumption of innocence and rights of defence of persons concerned by the allegations in the reports;
provide effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for breaches of certain rules of the directive, for instance for persons who hinder reporting or who retaliate against whistleblowers;
transpose the directive and notify to the European Commission the transposition measures by 17 December 2021; with a possible exemption for transposing the provisions on the obligation of private companies with between 50 and 249 employees to set up their internal reporting channels until 17 December 2023;
provide the Commission with annual data on numbers of reports received and investigations opened and their outcome, and the financial consequences.
The Commission submits to the European Parliament and the Council:
a first public and easily accessible report on the incorporation of the directive in EU countries’ national law by 17 December 2023; and
a second on the implementation of the directive and on possible amendments needed, by 17 December 2025.

European Border and Coast Guard
European Border and Coast Guard
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 on the European Border and Coast Guard
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It establishes a European Border and Coast Guard agency to:
assure European integrated management at the EU’s border;
manage border crossing efficiently; and
make the EU’s return* policy more effective as a key component of sustainable migration management.
It aims to address migratory challenges and potential future threats at the borders, combat serious international crime, and ensure internal EU security while fully respecting fundamental rights and safeguarding free movement.
KEY POINTS
A standing corps of 10,000 border guards:
will ensure that the agency can support EU Member States whenever and wherever needed;
will bring together agency staff, as well as border guards and return experts seconded or deployed by Member States, who will support the over 100,000 national border guards in their tasks.
In addition, the agency will have a budget to acquire its own equipment, such as vessels, planes and vehicles.
Executive powers
The standing corps will be able to carry out border control and return tasks, such as identity checks, authorising entry at the external borders, and carrying out border surveillance — only with the agreement of the host Member State.
More support on return
In addition to organising and financing joint return operations, the agency will now also be able to support Member States at all stages of return process with Member States remaining responsible for taking return decisions.
This support can now also include, for example, providing assistance to returnees before, during and post-arrival, as well as identifying non-EU nationals with no right to stay or acquiring travel documents.
Stronger cooperation with non-EU countries
The agency will be able — subject to prior agreement of the country concerned — to launch joint operations and deploy staff outside the EU, beyond countries neighbouring the EU, to provide support on border management.
Antenna offices
The agency will be able to set up antenna offices in Member States and in a non-EU country (subject to a status agreement) to support logistically its operational activities and guarantee the smooth running of operations.
European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur)
To improve Eurosur’s operation, the regulation incorporates it in the functioning of the European Border and Coast Guard.
The regulation enlarges Eurosur’s scope to cover most of the components of European integrated border management. This means being able to better detect, anticipate and react to crisis situations at the EU’s external borders and in non-EU countries.
A European Commission
implementing act, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/581 sets out the rules concerning information exchange and cooperation for the purposes of Eurosur including situational awareness, risk analysis and for supporting the planning and conduct of border control operations. It lays down:
the rules for reporting in Eurosur, including the type of information to be provided and the time limits for reporting;
the details of the information layers
* of the situational pictures
*;
the procedures for establishing specific situational pictures;
the responsibilities related to the reporting, to managing the situational pictures and for operating and maintaining the various technical systems and networks that support Eurosur;
Eurosur’s data security and data protection rules;
quality control mechanisms.
Repeal
It repeals Regulations (EU) No 1052/2013 on Eurosur from 4 December 2019 and (EU) 2016/1624 from 31 December 2020.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification (Cybersecurity Act)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to achieve a high level of cybersecurity*, cyber resilience and trust in the European Union (EU) by setting:
objectives, tasks and organisational matters for a strengthened and renamed European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), with a new permanent mandate;
a framework for voluntary European cybersecurity certification schemes for Information and communications technology (ICT) products, services and processes.
KEY POINTS
              
ENISA’s mandate is to:
achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across the EU;
support national authorities and EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity;
serve as a reference point for scientific and technical advice and expertise on cybersecurity for EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well as for other relevant stakeholders;

advise on research needs and priorities and contribute to the EU’s strategic cybersecurity research and innovation agenda;
contribute to the EU’s efforts to cooperate on cybersecurity with its international partners and organisations.
ENISA has the following administrative and management structure:
a Management Board. With 1 representative from each EU country and two members appointed by the European Commission; it establishes the general direction of the agency’s activities and ensures that the Agency carries out its tasks under conditions which enable it to serve in accordance with the founding regulation;
an Executive Board of 5 members, which prepares decisions to be adopted by the Management Board;
an independent Executive Director, accountable to the Management Board and reporting to the European Parliament and the Council when asked to do so, is responsible for managing the Agency;
an ENISA Advisory Group of recognised experts from relevant stakeholders such as the ICT industry, providers of electronic communications networks or services, SMEs, consumers, academics, operators of essential services, as well as representatives of competent authorities notified under the European Electronic Communications Code, standardisation organisations, law enforcement and data protection supervisory authorities, focuses on issues relevant to stakeholders and brings them to the attention of ENISA;
a National Liaison Officers Network composed of representatives of all EU countries facilitates the exchange of information between ENISA and the EU countries and supports ENISA in making its activities, findings and recommendations widely known.
The regulation creates the following:
a Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group of recognised experts to, for instance, advise the Commission on strategic issues regarding the EU cybersecurity certification framework and, upon request, ENISA on general and strategic issues concerning the Agency's relevant tasks;
a European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) composed of national representatives to advise and assist the Commission in its work to ensure the consistent implementation and application of the Act, and ENISA in relation to the preparation of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes.
ENISA:
is established for an indefinite period as of 27 June 2019;
operates according to a single programming document containing its annual and multiannual programming;
follows the Commission’s security rules to protect sensitive non-classified information and EU classified information;
does not divulge to third parties confidential information it processes or receives;
participates fully in EU measures to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities;
processes personal data in accordance with respective EU rules.
The regulation establishes a European cybersecurity certification framework to:
improve the functioning of the internal market by increasing the level of cybersecurity in the EU and enabling a harmonised approach at EU level to European cybersecurity certification schemes with a view to creating a digital single market for ICT products, services and processes;
set up a mechanism to establish certification schemes that confirm ICT products, services and processes that have been evaluated in accordance with such schemes comply with specified security requirements to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or functions or services offered by, or accessible via, those products, services and processes throughout their life cycle.
Under the framework:
The Commission: publishes an EU rolling work programme for European cybersecurity certification identifying strategic priorities and ICT products, services and processes or categories which could benefit from a scheme;may request ENISA to prepare a candidate certification scheme or review an existing one.
ENISA: prepares suitable draft schemes, following a request from the Commission or the ECCG;evaluates each adopted certification scheme every 5 years, taking account of the feedback received;maintains a dedicated website providing information on the schemes, certificates and conformity statements.
The voluntary European cybersecurity certification schemes:
aim to achieve various security objectives, such as protecting stored, transmitted and processed data;
denote the security level of ICT products, services and processes as ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ or ‘high’;
allow manufacturers and providers of low-risk (i.e. ‘basic’) ICT products, services and processes to assess these themselves (‘conformity self-assessment’);
must include certain features, such as clear descriptions of purpose, subject matter and scope and the evaluation criteria and methods used;
replace similar national ones, although those certificates remain valid until their expiry date.
Manufacturers and providers of certified ICT products, services or processes must make publicly available:
guidance and recommendations to help end users install, apply and maintain their products or services;
the duration they offer security support;
their contact details;
references to online repositories with information on known cybersecurity issues affecting their products or services.
EU countries appoint one or more national cybersecurity certification authorities with sufficient resources and powers to monitor, supervise and enforce the rules of the European certification schemes.
The Commission:
regularly assesses the efficiency and use of the adopted certification schemes and considers whether any scheme should be made compulsory;
completes its first detailed assessment by 31 December 2023, with others every 2 years;
evaluates ENISA’s impact, effectiveness and efficiency by 28 June 2024 and every 5 years thereafter.
Individuals and legal entities have the right to lodge a complaint with the issuer of a European cybersecurity certificate and to seek effective judicial remedy.
The regulation does not affect EU countries’ responsibilities for public security, defence, national security and criminal law.
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 from 27 June 2019.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve the comparability, reliability and exhaustiveness of statistics on gross national income at market prices (GNI)
*. These statistics are used especially to calculate the largest share of own resources in the budget of the European Union (EU).
It takes account of: 
the legal basis for producing statistics (Article 338(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union);
the own resources decision (Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom) and related legislation;
Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 setting up the EU’s system of national and regional accounts (known as ESA 2010).
It repeals Directive 89/130/EEC and Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1287/2003.
KEY POINTS
Definitions
The regulation requires that GNI and gross domestic product at market prices (GDP)
* be defined in accordance with ESA 2010.
Transmission of data and additional information to the European Commission
EU Member States have to:
calculate GNI;
before 1 October each year, provide the Commission’s statistical office (Eurostat) with data relating to the preceding year and any changes made to the data for previous years, such as: 
figures for GNI aggregates and their components,
totals for GDP and its components (according to the three approaches);
accompany these data with a report on the quality of GNI data detailing the methodology used to produce the data, and in particular describing any significant changes in the sources and methods used and explaining the revisions made to GNI aggregates and their components compared to previous periods;
provide Eurostat with an inventory of the sources and methods used to produce GNI aggregates and their components.
Procedures and checks on the calculation of GNI
An expert group, set up by Commission Decision, comprising representatives from the Member States, has been set up to:
advise the Commission on the comparability, reliability and exhaustiveness of GNI calculations;
examine implementation aspects of this regulation;
issue annual opinions on the quality of the GNI data submitted by the Member States for own resource purposes.

It has applied since 18 April 2019.
BACKGROUND
              
For further information, see:
Gross national income (Eurostat).
KEY TERMS
Gross national income at market prices (GNI): The total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. GNI equals GDP minus primary income payable by resident institutional units to non-resident institutional units plus primary income receivable by resident institutional units from the rest of the world.
Gross domestic product at market prices (GDP): This can be defined in three ways.
1.
Production approach. GDP is the sum of gross value added of the various institutional sectors or the various industries plus taxes and less subsidies on products (which are not allocated to sectors and industries). It is also the balancing item in the total economy production account.
2.
Expenditure approach. GDP is the sum of final uses of goods and services by resident institutional units (final consumption and gross capital formation) plus exports and minus imports of goods and services.
3.
Income approach. GDP is the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).

Summary 37:
EU type-approval legislation with regard to the UKThe United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union and became a third country (non-EU country) as of 1 February 2020.  withdrawal
EU type-approval legislation with regard to the UK (1)  withdrawal
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/26 — complementing EU type-approval legislation with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (1) from the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It establishes new rules to ensure a smooth transition for the type-approval* of motor vehicles, as well as of systems, components and separate technical units intended for these vehicles, when the UK (1) leaves the EU.
KEY POINTS
Legal context
Under EU law, the approval of a vehicle type in one EU country is valid EU-wide without the need for further tests and re-certification in other EU countries.
After the UK's withdrawal from the EU (or at the end of the transition period, if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified), the UK (1) type-approval authority will no longer be a national authority of an EU country.
Therefore, without agreement on a new relationship between the two parties, it will no longer be possible for manufacturers to place vehicles on the market of the 27 remaining EU countries (EU-27) on the basis of type-approvals granted in the UK (1).
EU-27 type-approval
Manufacturers can apply to an EU-27 type-approval authority for types previously approved by the UK (1) authority.
Manufacturers must: pay fees to the EU type-approval authority for carrying out its functions and duties;provide documentation and information to the EU authority if requested.
Conditions for approval
The type must comply with the rules for the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units applicable when the EU type-approval takes effect.
Approval may be granted on the basis of the same test reports used for the granting of the UK (1) type-approval in accordance with the applicable rules, regardless of whether the technical service that issued the test report has been designated and notified by the EU country granting the EU type-approval.
The EU authority can request the repetition of specific tests. These must be carried by a technical service designated and notified by that authority.
EU type-approval takes effect on the day it is granted granting unless otherwise stated. The UK (1) type-approval becomes invalid on the day preceding that on which EU type-approval takes effect. In any event, UK (1) type-approval will become invalid at the latest on the day on which the EU type-approval legislation ceases to apply to and in the UK (1).
EU type-approval authority
From the time that the EU type-approval takes effect, the EU authority in question is responsible for vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units manufactured on the basis of the UK (1) type-approval and placed or to be placed on the market, registered or put into service in the EU.
The manufacturer must also request that the EU authority in question takes over the obligations of the UK (1) type-approval authority concerning the manufacturer's other vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the EU on the basis of UK (1) type-approvals that have either become invalid, or for which no EU type-approval is sought under this regulation.
This request must be made for all vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units based on UK (1) type-approvals held by the manufacturer that were granted after 1 January 2008 unless the manufacturer can provide proof of an agreement with another EU type-approval authority covering those vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units.
The EU authority is not responsible for any acts or omissions of the UK (1) authority.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 13 January 2019.
BACKGROUND
The EU has adopted specific type-approval and market surveillance rules for agricultural and forestry vehicles, as well as for 2 and 3 wheel vehicles and quadracycles.
KEY TERMS
              
Type-approval: the procedure whereby an approval authority certifies that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisfies certain legal requirements.

It sets up the rules for Europol, including a system by which the European Parliament, together with national parliaments, can politically monitor Europol’s activities. In addition, it adapts Europol’s external relations to the rules of the Lisbon Treaty.
The regulation aligns the current Council decision on Europol with the rules of the Lisbon Treaty.
KEY POINTS
Objectives
Europol’s objectives are to support and strengthen:
action by authorities in the European Union (EU) countries;
mutual cooperation amongst EU countries in preventing and combating terrorism, serious crime affecting two or more EU countries and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by EU policy.
Tasks
The regulation sets out a number of specific tasks in order to meet those objectives including:
collecting, storing, processing, analysing and exchanging information including criminal intelligence;
notifying EU countries, via Europol national units, without delay, of any information and connection between criminal offences concerning them;
coordinating, organising and implementing investigative and operational actions to support and strengthen actions by EU countries’ authorities;
preparing threat assessments, strategic and operational analyses and general situation reports;
participating in joint investigation teams;
developing EU centres of specialised expertise for combating certain types of crime, for example the European Cybercrime Centre;
supporting EU countries in combating crime enabled, promoted or committed using the internet.
Scrutiny
Europol’s powers are accompanied by data protection safeguards and parliamentary scrutiny:
The European Data Protection Supervisor monitors Europol’s processing of personal data and there will be a clear procedure for citizens to address requests under EU law.

Summary 39:
Temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak (SURE)
Temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak (SURE)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/672 — establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Establishing the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE), the regulation lays down the conditions and procedures that enable the EU to provide financial assistance to a Member State that is experiencing, or seriously threatened with, a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
It primarily aims to finance short-time work schemes or similar measures aimed at protecting employees and the self-employed, thus mitigating the risk of unemployment and loss of income. It may also be used to finance as an ancillary, some health-related measures, in particular in the workplace.
KEY POINTS
Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union allows the Council to grant EU financial assistance to Member States experiencing (or seriously threatened with) difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their control.
Under the SURE regulation, a Member State may request EU financial assistance in support of national measures, such as short-time work schemes, to address the socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, where its actual (and possibly also planned) public expenditure has suddenly and severely increased after 1 February 2020.
Financial assistance would be provided upon request, in the form of a loan, paid in installments. For this purpose, the European Commission and the Member State concerned would conclude a loan agreement in accordance with Article 220(5) of the EU’s Financial Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — see summary).
To provide for the funding for the SURE Instrument, the Commission is empowered to borrow on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the EU at the most appropriate time to optimise the cost of funding and preserve its reputation as the EU’s issuer in the markets. Member States may contribute to the SURE Instrument by counter-guaranteeing the risk thus borne by the EU. Such contributions are to be provided in the form of irrevocable, unconditional and on-demand guarantees. The amount of guarantee contributed by each Member State corresponds to its relative share in the total gross national income of the EU of the total amount of €25 billion. The Commission concludes a guarantee agreement with the contributing Member State, setting out the payment conditions.
The maximum amount of financial assistance available under SURE is €100 billion for all Member States.
The SURE Instrument aims to complement national measures taken by the affected Member States to mitigate the direct economic, social and health-related effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Procedure for requesting and approving financial assistance
Financial assistance is made available by means of a Council implementing decision adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal and after consultation with the Member State concerned.
For this purpose, the Member State concerned provides the Commission with appropriate evidence related to the sudden and severe increase in actual (and possibly also planned) public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures, as well as, where appropriate, to relevant health-related measures, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Prudential rules
The Commission, on its part, is obliged to implement the following prudential rules applicable to the SURE loan portfolio: the share of loans granted to the 3 Member States representing the largest share of the loans may not exceed 60% of the maximum amount (i.e. 60% of €100 billion);the amounts due by the EU in a given year may not exceed 10% of the maximum amount of the SURE Instrument (i.e. 10% of €100 billion);where necessary, the Commission may roll over the associated borrowings contracted on behalf of the EU.
The Council implementing decision will include: the amount of the loan, maximum average maturity, pricing formula, maximum number of installments, availability period and other relevant rules for the granting of the financial assistance;an assessment of the Member State’s compliance with the conditions for using the SURE Instrument;a description of the national short-time work schemes or similar measures and, where appropriate, health-related measures, that may also be financed under the SURE regulation.
When adopting the implementing decision, the Council considers the Member State’s existing and expected needs as well as requests for SURE financial assistance already submitted or planned to be submitted by other Member States, while applying the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency.
Administration, possible use of guarantees and availability of the SURE Instrument
The Commission establishes the necessary arrangements for the administration of the loans with the European System of Central Banks. The beneficiary countries open special accounts with their national central bank to manage the financial assistance received.
In the event that, in spite of the application of all the prudential rules, the Commission may need to call on the guarantees provided by Member States, it is expected, before calling on these guarantees, to examine whether it can draw on the margin available under the own-resources ceiling for payment appropriations, to the extent the Commission deems sustainable, having regard to, among other things, the total contingent liabilities of the EU and the sustainability of the general budget of the EU.
The SURE Instrument will become available once all Member States have contributed their share of the guarantees (see above). The period of availability of the SURE Instrument during which a Council implementing decision granting the financial assistance may be adopted ends on 31 December 2022. The Council, following a proposal from the Commission, may decide to extend the period of availability of the SURE Instrument, each time for an additional period of 6 months, where the Commission concludes that the severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 outbreak affecting the financing of the relevant measures continues to exist.
The regulation does not apply in the United Kingdom.

The regulation entered into force on 20 May 2020.

Summary 40:
Recovery and resolution of central counterparties
Recovery and resolution of central counterparties
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules and procedures for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties (CCPs)*.
These are designed to ensure CCPs have measures to recover from financial distress or can continue their main tasks if they are failing, or likely to fail, while winding up other activities through normal insolvency procedures.
The overall aim is to preserve financial stability and minimise the costs to taxpayers of any CCP failure.
KEY POINTS
              
Each European Union (EU) Member State has the following responsibilities.
Appointing one or more resolution authorities. These:may be national central banks, ministries or public authorities with administrative powers;have the expertise, resources, operational capacity and extensive powers to act quickly and flexibly.
Designating a single ministry with overall responsibility for exercising the functions entrusted to the ministries under the legislation.
Applying penalties for breaches of the regulation.
Resolution authorities establish, manage and chair a resolution college. This includes the relevant authorities and provides a framework to:
share information;
draw up resolution plans;
assess a CCP’s resolvability and possible obstacles;
coordinate public information about resolution plans and strategies.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA):
drafts various regulatory technical standards that will be adopted by the European Commission;
creates the ESMA Resolution Committee that will promote the drawing up and coordination of resolution plans and develop methods for the resolution of failing CCPs;
cooperates with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Banking Authority;
maintains a central database of national penalties applied for breaches of the legislation.
Competent authorities, resolution authorities and ESMA:
cooperate closely to carry out the tasks set out in the regulation;
base decisions on principles such as: proportionality in view of the CCP’s legal form, size, complexity and liquidity,the need for efficacy and timeliness, the need to keep down costs and, as far as possible, avoid use of public finance.
Recovery planning requires CCPs to draw up and maintain a recovery plan. These:
set out actions, with or without a default, to restore financial soundness;
include measures to address all possible risks, absorb losses and replenish financial resources;
contain indicators based on a CCP’s risk profile;
do not assume access to public finance or central bank liquidity;
consider the interests of all stakeholders;
ensure clearing members do not have unlimited exposure to the CCP.
It also requires the competent authority, supervisory college and resolution authority to assess the recovery plans and consider any changes.
Resolution planning requires the following.
The resolution authority of the CCP has to draw up a resolution plan that: sets out how it would use its resolution powers to absorb losses and ensure the continuity of the CCP’s critical functions;takes account of the impact of the plan on clearing members, financial markets and the financial system;does not assume access to public finance or central bank help;makes prudent assumptions about finance that might be available.
CCPs under resolution have to cooperate with the resolution authority and provide all the necessary information;
The resolution college has to agree on the plan, including any changes, within 4 months of receiving it.
Assessing resolvability requires the resolution authority, coordinating with the resolution college, to:
assess whether a CCP is resolvable, to enable it to continue operating its critical functions;
identify any obstacles to resolvability and instruct the CCP to take action to remove them.
Early intervention measures enable a competent authority to instruct a CCP it considers could be facing financial problems to:
take corrective action;
remove some or all of senior management or board members.
Resolution authorities take special account of the following when implementing their plans.
Objectives:
continuity of the CCP’s critical functions;
avoidance of damage to the financial system;
protection of public funds.
Conditions:
CCP actual or likely failure;
absence of alternative private sector solution;
importance of protecting the public interest.
Valuation:
two assessments to ensure a fair, prudent and realistic appreciation of the CCP’s assets, liabilities, rights and obligations.
Safeguards:
shareholders, clearing members and other creditors should not lose more than if the resolution authority had not intervened (‘No creditor worse off’ principle);
clients and indirect clients have the right to compensation clearing members may receive;
anyone affected by a crisis prevention order or resolution action has a right of appeal.
Resolution authorities can apply the following measures, individually or collectively.
Position and loss allocation. Terminating contracts, reducing a CCP’s payment obligations to non-defaulting clearing members or requiring the latter to make a cash contribution to the CCP.
Write-down and conversion. Reducing or converting the size of instruments of ownership, debt or other unsecured liabilities, requiring a CCP to provide and implement a business reorganisation plan.
Sale of business. Selling ownership or any assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a CCP in the resolution procedure.
Bridge CCP. Transferring temporarily to another CCP (‘bridge CCP’) ownership or any assets, rights, obligations or liabilities of a CCP in the resolution procedure.
Alternative funding. Contracting to borrow or obtain other forms of financing to address temporary cash flow problems.
Member States may, if a CCP failure threatens a systemic crisis, inject cash or take it into public ownership (government stabilisation tools), provided the measures are temporary and comply with EU State aid rules.
The regulation amends the following:
Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010 (see summary), (EU) No 648/2012 (see summary), (EU) No 600/2014 (see summary), (EU) No 806/2014 (see summary) and (EU) 2015/2365 (see summary);
Directives 2002/47/EC (see summary), 2004/25/EC (see summary), 2007/36/EC (see summary), 2014/59/EU (see summary) and (EU) 2017/1132 (see summary).
Under the review procedure:
ESMA assesses its staffing and resources needs by 12 February 2024;
the Commission submits a report on the legislation to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union by 12 February 2026.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It entered into force on 11 February 2021 and applies from 12 August 2022 with the exception of a few articles that apply earlier.
BACKGROUND

European Year of Rail (2021)
European Year of Rail (2021)
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU) 2020/2228 on a European Year of Rail (2021)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
              
In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal (see summary), the main aim of the European Year of Rail is to encourage and support the efforts of the European Union (EU), EU countries, regional and local authorities and other organisations to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail.
KEY POINTS
Objectives
The decision has a number of specific objectives, including:
to promote rail as a sustainable, innovative, interconnected and intermodal, safe and affordable mode of transport, specifically by highlighting the role of rail: as a game changer helping to achieve the EU’s climate-neutrality objective by 2050,as a pillar of an efficient logistics network, capable of guaranteeing essential services, even during unexpected crises,as a transport mode that reaches out to the wider public, especially the young, including by presenting rail as an attractive career opportunity;
to highlight the European, cross-border dimension of rail, which brings citizens closer together;
to enhance the contribution of rail to the EU’s economy, industry and society;
to promote the key role of railways in international passenger transport within the EU and beyond;
to contribute to implementing the fourth railway package and to raising awareness of the measures required to establish the single European railway area (see summary), based on a properly functioning trans-European transport network.
Measures
A number of measures at the EU, national, regional and local levels are planned to achieve these objectives. They will be coordinated with existing efforts to promote rail transport. These measures include:
initiatives and events to promote debate, build a positive image, raise awareness and facilitate the engagement of citizens, businesses and public authorities to increase trust in rail, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, and to promote the attractiveness of rail for the transport of more people and goods as a means of combating climate change;
initiatives in EU countries to encourage, in both the public and private sectors, business travel and commuting patterns by rail;
informative exhibitions and inspirational, educational and awareness-raising campaigns.
The European Commission will also consider feasibility studies on:
creating a European label to promote goods and products transported by rail to encourage businesses to switch their transport to rail;
introducing a rail connectivity index, with the aim of categorising the level of integration achieved through the use of services on the rail network and showing the potential of rail to compete with other modes of transport.

Summary 43:
Minimum requirements for water reuse
Minimum requirements for water reuse
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out harmonised parameters to guarantee the safety of water reuse in agricultural irrigation, with the aim of encouraging this practice and helping to address droughts and water stress.
It also aims to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 6 on the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and Goal 12 on sustainable consumption and production.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation sets out minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring and rules on risk management, for the safe use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation in the context of integrated water management.
It builds on 2 European Commission communications:
the 2012 Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Water Resources (see summary); and
the 2015 EU action plan for the Circular Economy which committed to a series of actions to promote the use of treated waste water and to a legal proposal setting out minimum requirements for water reuse.
Scope
The regulation applies whenever treated urban waste water is reused, according to Article 12(1) of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste water, for agricultural irrigation (see summary).
An EU country can decide that it is not appropriate to reuse water for agricultural irrigation in one or more of its river basin districts or parts thereof, on the basis of specific criteria: the geographic and climatic conditions of the district or parts thereof;the pressures on and the status of other water resources;the pressures on and the status of the surface water bodies in which treated urban waste water is discharged;the environmental and resource costs of reclaimed water and of other water resources.
Such decision must be duly justified and regularly reviewed to take into account changing circumstances, such as climate change projections and national climate change adaptation strategies, as well as the river basins management plans drawn up in accordance with the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC — see summary).
The regulation allows for time-limited exemptions from the rules for research or pilot projects, subject to certain conditions.
Reclaimed water quality
The reclamation facility operator must ensure that reclaimed water intended for agricultural irrigation complies with:
the minimum requirements for water quality set out in the annex 1 of the regulation — covering microbiological elements (such as levels of E. coli bacteria) and monitoring requirements for routine and validation monitoring;
any additional conditions concerning water quality set by the competent authority in the relevant permit issued.
Risk management
The relevant national authority must ensure that a water reuse risk management plan to produce, supply and use reclaimed water is drawn up.
The water reuse risk management plan can be drafted by the reclamation facility operator, other parties in the water reuse project or the end users, as appropriate, and it must identify the risk management responsibilities of all parties in the water reuse project.
It must, in particular, set out any additional water quality requirements, identify appropriate preventive and/or corrective measures and any additional barriers or measures to ensure the safety of the system.
Permit obligations
The production and supply of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation requires a permit.
Parties concerned must submit an application to the relevant national authority.
The permits sets out the obligations for the reclamation facility operator, and, where relevant, of other parties involved in the water reuse system, which are based on the risk management plan. They must specify a number of elements including: the reclaimed water quality class or classes and the agricultural use for which the reclaimed water is permitted, the place of use, the reclamation facilities and the estimated yearly volume of the reclaimed water to be produced;conditions in relation to the minimum requirements for water quality and monitoring;conditions in relation to additional requirements for the reclamation facility operator, set out in the water reuse risk management plan;any other conditions necessary to eliminate any unacceptable risks to the environment and to human and animal health so that any risks are of an acceptable level;the validity period of the permit;the point of compliance.
Permits must be regularly reviewed and updated where necessary, and at least in the case of significant changes in the treatment processes or in the site conditions.
Compliance checks
The competent national authority must check compliance with the conditions set out in the permit. These can be carried out by: on-the-spot checks;monitoring data obtained, in particular pursuant to this regulation;any other adequate means.
The regulation also sets out the measures to be taken in case of non-compliance.
The competent national authority must also regularly check compliance with risk management plans.
Transparency and information sharing
National contact points must be established to facilitate cross-border coordination where necessary.
To ensure transparency, the regulation also sets out rules on: awareness raising;information to be provided to the public;information on the monitoring of implementation.
The Commission will carry out an evaluation of the regulation by 26 June 2028.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 26 June 2023.

Work-life balance for parents and carers
Work-life balance for parents and carers
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/1158 on work-life balance for parents and carers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It seeks to ensure gender equality with respect to labour market opportunities and treatment at work throughout the EU by facilitating the work-life balance for workers who are parents or carers.
It sets out minimum requirements for family-related leaves (paternity, parental and carers’ leave) and flexible working arrangements.
It seeks to increase women’s participation in the labour market and to achieve a better sharing of caring responsibilities between men and women.
It creates incentives for men to assume an equal share of caring responsibilities by creating paid paternity and parental leave which is one of the reasons of the low take-up of leave by fathers.
The imbalance in the design of work-life balance policies between women and men reinforces gender stereotypes and differences between work and care. Policies on equal treatment should aim to address the issue of stereotypes in both men's and women's occupations and roles.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive relates to all men and women who have an employment contract or an employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreements or practice in force in each EU country, taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU.
Minimum rights
The directive provides for minimum individual rights related to the following:
paternity leave, parental leave and carers’ leave;
flexible working arrangements for workers who are parents, or carers; and
legal protection for those applying for or making use of family-related leave and flexible working arrangements.
EU countries may choose to introduce or maintain rules that are more favourable to workers.
Paternity leave
Fathers or equivalent second parents have the right to take paternity leave of 10 working days on the birth of a child.
Paternity leave has to be paid at the national sick pay level.
The right to paternity leave must not be made subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification.
EU countries may make the right to a payment or an allowance subject to periods of previous employment, which must not exceed 6 months immediately prior to the expected date of the birth of the child.
Parental leave
Each worker has an individual right to 4 months’ paid parental leave, 2 months of which are non-transferable between the parents.
At least 2 months of parental leave per parent need to be paid at an adequate level.
EU countries may make the right to parental leave subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification, which must not exceed 1 year.
EU countries must ensure that workers have the right to request that they take parental leave in a flexible way, such as on a part-time basis, or in alternating periods of leave separated by periods of work.
Carers’ leave
The directive introduces rules for carers, namely workers caring for relatives requiring support due to serious medical reasons. These rules also cover care for a person who lives in the same household as the worker.
Each carer is entitled to take 5 working days per year.
Flexible working arrangements
Workers with children up to a specified age, but at least 8, and carers have the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes.
These arrangements include the use of remote working arrangements, flexible working schedules, or a reduction in working hours.
Employers must deal with these requests within a reasonable period of time and provide reasons for refusing or postponing such arrangements.
EU countries may make the right to request flexible working arrangements subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification. This period must not exceed 6 months.
Legal protection
EU countries must introduce rules to ensure:
workers are protected from discrimination and dismissal on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, family-related leave or flexible working arrangements;
workers who consider that they have been dismissed on the basis that they have exercised such rights should be able to ask the employer to provide duly substantiated grounds for the dismissal;
the previous job and the rights acquired or in the process of being acquired before leave by the worker are maintained after the leave.
Repeal
The directive repeals Directive 2010/18/EU on parental leave from 2 August 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 August 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 2 August 2022 (except for the payment of the last 2 weeks of parental leave, for which the deadline is 2 August 2024).

Summary 47:
Transparent and predictable working conditions in the EU
Transparent and predictable working conditions in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/1152 on transparent and predictable working conditions in the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It aims to improve working conditions by promoting more transparent and predictable employment while ensuring labour-market adaptability. It introduces minimum rights and updates the rules on the information to be provided to workers concerning their working conditions.
The directive contributes to reinforcing Europe’s social dimension as part of the European Pillar of Social Rights roll-out.
KEY POINTS
              
The directive is issued in the context of Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU which says that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect the worker’s health, safety and dignity, which limit the maximum number of working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave. It is also a concrete follow-up of Principles 5 and 7 of the European Pillar of Social Rights.
Who is covered?
The directive applies to those who work more than 3 hours per week over a 4-week period (i.e. more than 12 hours per month) who are bound by an employment contract or in an employment relationship as defined by national law, collective agreements or practice in force in each EU country — with consideration to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU. Persons covered could include workers on zero-hour contracts, such as fast-food-chain workers, workers in logistical centres, shelf-stackers in supermarkets, domestic or voucher-based workers* and platform-economy workers, such as on-demand drivers or couriers, provided they fulfil the above criteria defining a worker.
Civil servants, the armed forces or members of emergency and law enforcement services may, on objective grounds, be excluded from Chapter III of the directive (Minimum requirements relating to working conditions).
Employment relationship
Employers must inform workers in writing, and at the latest within a week from the first working day, of the basic elements of the employment relationship, including:
the identity of the parties to the employment relationship, the place of work and the nature of the activity;
the start date and, if it is fixed-term, end date, as well as the duration and conditions of any probationary period;
basic pay, any other component of remuneration, including overtime, and the frequency and method of payment;
the duration of the normal workday or week when the work rhythm is predictable;
where the pattern of work is unpredictable, employers must inform workers of the reference hours and days on which they may be called upon to work, the minimum notice before starting work and the number of guaranteed paid hours.
For supplementary information as indicated just below, the deadline for employers to inform workers is at the latest 1 month from the first working day:
the duration of paid leave;
any training entitlement;
any collective agreements governing the worker’s conditions;
the identity of the social security body receiving social contributions, where this is the employer’s responsibility;
notice periods where the employment relationship is terminated or the method for determining such notice periods;
for temporary agency workers, the details of the user-undertakings (i.e. those making use of the agency workers’ services) when and as soon as known.
Workers relocated (‘posted’) to another EU country or to a non-EU country
Employers must provide relevant documents before departure including at least the following additional information:
countries where the work is to be carried out and its expected duration;
currency of payment;
where applicable, benefits in cash or kind relating to the work assignments;
information on whether repatriation is provided for, and the applicable conditions.
Posted workers covered by Directive 96/71/EC (see summary here) must in addition be notified of, among other things:
the applicable remuneration under the law of the host EU country;
where applicable, any allowances specific to posting and any arrangements for reimbursing expenditure on travel and accommodation costs.
Minimum requirements for the employment contract
The directive sets a number of minimum rights for workers, including the right to:
not have the probationary period exceed 6 months, unless it is in the worker’s interest or when the activity justifies it;
work for another employer outside the established working hours without unfavourable treatment, unless incompatibility restrictions are justified on objective grounds;
for workers whose work pattern is decided by the employer and is entirely or mostly unpredictable, the right to refuse a work assignment outside previously defined reference hours and days without suffering adverse consequences;
request, after six months’ service with the same employer, a job with more predictable and secure working conditions;
receive training cost free, when the employer is required by EU or national legislation or collective agreements to provide such training.
EU countries may allow the social partners to conclude collective agreements which establish working conditions that differ from those referred to just above, provided that the overall protection of workers is respected.
On-demand contracts
*
EU countries which allow the use of on-demand contracts or similar employment contracts (e.g. gig-economy or zero-hour contracts) must take measures to avoid abusive practices, such as:
limiting the use and duration of on-demand employment or similar contracts;
putting in place a rebuttable presumption* that an employment relationship exists, with a guaranteed number of paid hours based on hours worked in a preceding reference period.
Complaints, redress, protections and dismissals
EU countries must:
ensure that workers who have not received the relevant information in due time have access to at least one of the following two measures: submit a complaint to a competent authority and receive redress in a timely and effective manner; orbenefit from favourable legal presumptions
ensure that workers, including those whose employment relationship has ended, have access to effective and impartial dispute resolution and a right to redress*;
introduce measures to protect workers from any adverse treatment by the employer and from any adverse consequences resulting from a complaint lodged with the employer;
take measures to prohibit workers being dismissed because they have exercised the rights outlined in the directive.
The directive does not constitute justification for reducing the general level of protection already enjoyed by workers in the EU, and does not prevent EU countries from adopting legislation that is more favourable to workers.
Repeal
The directive repeals Council Directive 91/533/EEC on Informing employees of their working conditions from 1 August 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has applied since 31 July 2019 and has to become law in the EU countries by 1 August 2022.

Summary 48:
Fight against fraud to the EU’s financial interests by means of criminal law
Fight against fraud to the EU’s financial interests by means of criminal law
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2017/1371 — using criminal law to protect the EU’s financial interests
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
To create a stronger and more harmonised system, with minimum common rules, to fight crime affecting the EU budget.
To better protect the EU’s financial interests and taxpayers’ money across the EU.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The directive concerns:
fraud and other criminal offences, such as corruption, misappropriation or money laundering, affecting the EU’s financial interests — i.e. the EU budget, the budgets of the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies established by the treaties, or the budgets directly or indirectly managed and monitored by them;
‘serious offences’ against the common value added tax (VAT) system, like VAT carousels* (offences considered to be serious when they are connected with the territory of two or more EU countries and involve a total damage of at least €10,000,000).
It also sets out common rules on sanctions and limitation periods in relation to the criminal offences covered by this directive.
Definitions
Each of the following offences is given a definition at EU level:
fraud committed intentionally — what is regarded as fraud in respect of expenditure as procurement and non-procurement as well as of revenue arising from VAT own resources and other revenue;
money laundering as defined in Directive (EU) 2015/849;
passive and active corruption committed intentionally;
misappropriation committed intentionally.
What is meant by ‘public officials’ — EU and national (including in EU countries) — is specified in the definitions of money laundering, corruption and misappropriation.
The criminal offences as defined in the directive fall within the material competence of the newly established European Public Prosecutor’s Office, an independent EU body empowered to investigate and prosecute these crimes and bring them to judgment before competent national courts.
Common approach
In all EU countries (except Denmark and the United Kingdom (1)):
these offences are all to be punished as criminal offences, as are their attempt as well as their incitement, aiding and abetting;
legal persons* should be held liable for any of the criminal offences committed for their benefit — not excluding the possibility of criminal proceedings against natural persons who are the perpetrators or who are solely responsible.
Sanctions
The directive provides for minimum ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ criminal sanctions.
These include a maximum penalty of at least 4 years of imprisonment:
where the financial damage to the EU budget is above the threshold of €100.000;
in any case of serious offences against the common VAT system;
other serious circumstances defined under national law.
Where a criminal offence involves damages of below €10.000, EU countries may introduce sanctions that are not criminal.
Regarding legal persons, the directive envisages various other types of sanctions in addition to fines (criminal and non-criminal).
Offences committed within a criminal organisation within the meaning of Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA constitute an aggravating circumstance.
These sanctions do not exclude:
the possibility of more severe sanctions in national legislation;
the exercise of disciplinary powers by the competent authorities against public officials.
The directive also deals with the following:
the freezing and confiscation of means and proceeds from the criminal offences that affect the EU budget;
establishing jurisdiction for such offences;
minimum limitation periods enabling investigations and prosecutions as well as allowing the enforcement of the penalties imposed following a conviction for a commission of these offences.
Cooperation between EU countries and EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies
The EU countries, Eurojust, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Commission’s European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) must cooperate against the criminal offences covered by this directive. OLAF and, where appropriate, Eurojust provide technical and operational assistance to facilitate the coordination of the EU countries’ investigations.
If the Court of Auditors and auditors responsible for auditing the budgets of the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies or other budgets managed and audited by the institutions, find anything that could qualify as a criminal offence under this directive, they must inform the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, OLAF and the other competent authorities. EU countries must ensure that national audit bodies do the same.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 6 July 2019.
BACKGROUND
              
Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union obliges the EU and EU countries to counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the EU’s financial interests with measures that act as a deterrent.
More than 90% of the EU budget is managed nationally. Damage to the EU budget resulting from crime and other illegal activities amounts to hundreds of millions of euros each year and is of serious concern. In 2011, the Commission adopted a communication which contained proposals to improve the protection of EU financial interests (see IP/11/644).

KEY TERMS
              
VAT carousel: where fraudsters import goods VAT-free from other EU countries, then sell the goods to domestic buyers, charging them VAT. The sellers then disappear without paying the VAT to the tax authorities.
Legal person: an entity recognised by the law as being entitled to rights and duties in the same way as a natural or human person, the common example being a company.

Fees for card-based payments
Fees for card-based payments
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
This regulation caps interchange fees. It increases transparency on fees thus permitting retailers to know the level of fees paid when accepting cards. It enhances competition by providing consumers with more and better choices between different types of payment cards and service providers.
KEY POINTS
              
Specifically, the regulation:
caps interchange fees at 0.2% of the transaction value for consumer debit cards and at 0.3% for consumer credit cards;
as regards consumer credit cards, allows EU countries to define percentage caps lower than 0.3%;
as regards consumer debit card transactions, allows EU countries to impose a fee of no more than 5 eurocents per transaction interchange fee in combination with the 0.2% cap;
provides for a limited number of exemptions, such as business cards used only for business expenses being charged directly to the account of the company;
increases transparency on the level of fees paid by retailers, thus enabling them more easily to select which payment cards to accept.
The regulation is part of a package that includes also the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), on which political agreement was reached in May 2015. The package aims to promote the digital single market by making payments safer and cheaper and paves the way for innovative payment technologies.

EU statistics of goods transport by inland waterways
EU statistics of goods transport by inland waterways
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/974 on statistics of goods transport by inland waterways
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the production of comparable EU-wide statistics on inland waterways freight transport.
It seeks to provide a picture of the volume and performance of freight transport on the EU inland waterway network.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 which had been substantially amended several times.
KEY POINTS
Scope
EU countries must each compile and transmit to the European Commission (Eurostat) data relating to inland waterways transport.
The regulation does not apply to the carriage of goods by vessels of less than 50 deadweight tonnes or to vessels:
used mainly for transporting passengers;
used for ferrying purposes;
used solely for non-commercial purposes by port authorities and public authorities;
used solely for bunkering or storage;
not used to carry goods such as fishery vessels, dredgers, floating workshops, houseboats and pleasure craft.
EU countries in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways — national, international or transit — exceeds 1 million tonnes must provide data stipulated in the tables in Annexes I to IV to the regulation.
EU countries which do not have international or transit inland waterways transport, but in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds 1 million tonnes, shall supply only the data required by Annex V to the regulation.
The effect of this regulation is limited to those countries in which this mode of transport exists.
Pilot studies
By 8 December 2018, the European Commission, in cooperation with EU countries, is to develop the appropriate methodology for compiling statistics on passenger transport by inland waterways, including by cross-border transport services.
In 2019, the Commission will launch voluntary pilot studies to be carried out by EU countries that provide data within the scope of this regulation on the availability of statistical data relating to passenger transport by inland waterways. The studies shall assess the feasibility of those new data collections, the costs of the related data collections and the statistical quality implied.
By 8 December 2020, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the results of the pilot studies.
Data collection and transmission
Data are reported on the basis of the territoriality principle whereby each country reports the loading, unloading and movements of goods that take place on its national territory.
The tables in Annexes I to V to the regulation lay down the rules and formats for data collection.
EU countries must transmit to Eurostat the data they have gathered no later than 5 months after the end of the relevant period of observation.
The Commission is to adopt implementing acts laying down the arrangements for transmitting data to Eurostat.
Dissemination of data
Eurostat disseminates the data at a frequency similar to that laid down for the transmission of data (quarterly or annually).
Quality of data
The Commission is to adopt implementing acts laying down the methodological requirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the data produced.
EU countries must ensure the quality of data transmitted and supply the Commission (Eurostat) with a report containing such information and data as it may request in order to verify the quality of the data transmitted.
Reports on implementation
The Commission (Eurostat) shall report for the first time by 31 December 2020, and thereafter every 5 years, to the European Parliament and the Council on the regulation’s implementation and on future developments.
Committee procedure
The Commission is advised and assisted by the European Statistical System Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 (How the European Statistical System works).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 5 August 2018. Regulation (EU) 2018/974 codifies and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 and its subsequent amendments.

Summary 53:
A strengthened Schengen Information System
A strengthened Schengen Information System
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 on the use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals
Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS in the field of border checks, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement
Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THESE REGULATIONS?
              
The Schengen Information System (SIS), created in 1995 following the abolition of internal border controls in the EU, is a large-scale database supporting external border control and law enforcement cooperation between member countries of the Schengen Agreement.
The 3 regulations are designed to strengthen the existing measures in SIS II — established in 2006 and operational from 2013 — particularly in light of the new migration and security challenges. They will replace the current legislation laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1986/2006 and (EC) No 1987/2006, and Decision 2007/533/JHA.
This summary describes how the SIS will operate once the 3 new regulations are fully in force.
KEY POINTS
Architecture
SIS consists of:
a central system (Central SIS) with a technical support function (CS-SIS), containing a database (SIS database) performing technical supervision and administrative tasks, and a backup CS-SIS;a uniform national interface (NI-SIS) in each country which members use to enter, update, delete and search SIS data;a national system (N.SIS) in each country to communicate with Central SIS, including at least one national or shared backup N.SIS. It is not possible to search data files in another N.SIS, unless the countries concerned have agreed to share the file;
a communication infrastructure between CS-SIS, backup CS-SIS and NI-SIS provides an encrypted virtual network for SIS data and their exchange between SIRENE bureaux.
The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA):
implements technical solutions to strengthen the uninterrupted availability of SIS;
in exceptional circumstances, may develop an additional copy of the SIS database;
must present a report no later than 28 December 2019 on options for technical solutions, containing an independent impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis;
publishes a list of the N.SIS offices and SIRENE Bureaux.
Procedural rules state:
alerts* should remain in SIS only as long as required for their specific purpose and be deleted when they achieve their purpose;
alerts must be reviewed within defined periods. The member country may then decide to prolong them, otherwise they are automatically deleted. The review periods are 5 years: persons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes and missing persons who may, or may not, need to be placed under protection3 years: people sought to assist with a judicial procedure and unknown wanted persons1 year: children at risk, vulnerable persons who need to be protected from travelling and persons for discreet, inquiry or specific checks10 years: objects for discreet inquiry or specific checks or for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings;
categories of data to be entered into the system. These are designed to help end-users take decisions quickly. They include minimum requirements (surname, date of birth, reason for the alert and action to be taken) and other data, such as type of offence, photographic and dactyloscopic* information, if available;
use of biometric and dactyloscopic data must respect EU law and fundamental rights, and meet minimum quality standards and technical specifications;
a case must be adequate, relevant and sufficiently important to warrant an SIS alert, for example, an alert linked to a terrorist offence meets these criteria;
only the issuing member country may modify, add to, correct, update or delete data in SIS;
a country which considers acting on an alert would be incompatible with its national law, international obligations or essential interests may attach a flag* to the alert. This indicates it will not take any action on its territory.
Costs:
the EU budget covers the operational, maintenance and development costs of Central SIS and the communication infrastructure;
Schengen member countries cover the operational, maintenance and development costs of their own N.SIS.
Alert categories per regulation
Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 strengthens enforcement of the EU’s return policy and reduces incentives for illegal immigration into the EU:
it lays down common conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts and exchanging supplementary information on non-EU nationals subject to return decisions*;
it requires national authorities to enter alerts as soon as a return decision is taken;
it establishes harmonised procedures on categories of data to be included in the alertverification if a return decision has been complied with and, if not, the follow-up between the relevant authoritiesretention and deletion of alerts to ensure there is no delay between the departure of a non-EU national and the activation of an entry bancompulsory consultation between national authorities before granting or extending a residence permit or long-stay visa for a non-EU national who may be the subject of a return alert in another EU countryentering an alert on a return decision if the person is legally staying elsewhere in the EU.
Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 covers the use of SIS for entry bans and border checks:
it establishes the conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts and exchange of supplementary information* on non-EU nationals refused entry or the right to stay in the EU;
it introduces harmonised procedures on categories of data to be included in the alertcompulsory entry of an alert when a non-EU national is refused entry or the right to stay because they pose a security threat or are subject to a restrictive order preventing entry into, or transit through, an EU countrynon-EU nationals with the right of free movement within the EUmandatory consultation between national authorities before granting or extending a residence permit or long-stay visa to a non-EU national refused the right of entry or stay in another EU country;
it guarantees non-EU nationals the right to be informed in writing if they are the subject of an alert.
Regulation 2018/1862 improves and extends the use of SIS for cooperation between police and judicial authorities:
it establishes the conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts in the SIS on people and objects, and for exchanging supplementary information and data in police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters;
it covers procedures on alerts on: people wanted for arrest, for surrender or extradition purposes;missing persons;vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling, either for their own protection or to prevent a threat to public order or security;children at risk, notably of abduction, trafficking or becoming involved in terrorism;individuals being sought to assist with a judicial procedure as witnesses or because they have been summoned in connection with criminal proceedings;unknown wanted persons whose identity is being sought;discreet or specific checks and inquiries to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute criminal offences, execute a criminal sentence or prevent threats to public security;items to be seized or used as evidence in criminal proceedings, especially readily identifiable objects such as cars, boats, aircraft, firearms, identity documents and banknotes.
Data rightsIndividuals have the right to:
know whether or not their personal data are being processed, for what purposes and under what conditions;
lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
correction of inaccurate personal data without undue delay;
erasure of personal data if their use is no longer necessary or these have been unlawfully processed;
take action to access, rectify, erase, obtain information or compensation for an alert that concerns them;
compensation from a member country for any material or non-material damage they suffer from unlawful processing of their personal data.
SIS member governments:
are committed to enforcing rulings on data protection rights;
report annually to the European Data Protection Board on the number of requests they receive to access data and correct inaccuracies, and the volume of court cases and their outcome.
Independent supervisory authorities monitor the legality of national processing of personal data in SIS; the European Data Protection Supervisor set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 performs the same role for eu-LISA. The two cooperate to ensure coordinated supervision of SIS.
Data processed in SIS and related supplementary information may not be transferred or made available to non-EU countries or international organisations.
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 applies to personal data processed by eu-LISA, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and Eurojust.
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 apply to personal data processed by national competent authorities and services.
The following have access to data in SIS:
National authorities responsible for border control, police and customs checks;prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist acts or other serious criminal offences;decisions, including on residence permits and long-stay visas, on the entry, stay and return of non-EU nationals;security checks on non-EU nationals applying for international protection;naturalisation decisions;public prosecutions in criminal proceedings and judicial inquiries;issuing registration certificates for vehicles, boats, aircraft and firearms;
the EU agencies below have the right to access and search for the data in SIS they require to carry out their responsibilities. They inform the issuing member country when a search reveals the existence of an alert. They may not connect parts of SIS or transfer any of its data to their own system Europol: may access all data, not just some as previously. SIS member countries must inform the law enforcement agency of any hits or alerts relating to terrorist offences;Eurojust, which handles judicial cooperation of criminal matters;European Border and Coast Guard, teams involved in return-related tasks and migration management support teams.
The European Commission evaluates every 5 years the use these agencies make of SIS.
ResponsibilitiesEach SIS member country:
ensures the data are accurate, up-to-date and entered and stored in SIS lawfully, and respect general data processing rules;
sets up, operates, maintains and develops its N.SIS, according to common standards, protocols and technical procedures, and connects it to NI-SIS;
ensures the uninterrupted availability of SIS data to end-users;
transmits its alerts through its N.SIS;
designates an N.SIS Office with central responsibility to ensure the smooth operation and security of its N.SIS, access of the competent authorities to the SIS, overall compliance with the regulation and appropriate availability of the SIS for all end-users;
appoints a national authority (the SIRENE Bureau) as a single contact point operational 24/7 for the exchange and availability of all supplementary information on alerts and to facilitate follow-up action;
adopts security, business continuity and disaster recovery plans to protect data and prevent unauthorised access;
applies professional secrecy and confidentiality rules, including close monitoring of external contractors. Private companies and organisations are banned from operational management of the N.SIS;
keeps electronic logs, normally deleted after 3 years, on alerts, access and exchange of personal data to check whether the search was lawful and ensure data integrity and security;
operates a national SIS training programme for staff with access to SIS on data security, fundamental rights, including data protection, and data processing rules and regulations.
The Commission:
adopts implementing and delegated acts on technical aspects of SIS and updates these as necessary;
under Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, has an overall coordinating role for the evaluation and monitoring mechanism it implements with EU governments to ensure Schengen rules are fully applied nationally. This includes evaluation of the SIS;
will submit a report to the European Parliament and EU governments by 28 December 2019, and every year thereafter, until decides on the date for SIS operations to start, on the state of play of preparations for full implementation of the updated SIS regulation 2018/1862;
carries out an overall evaluation of Central SIS, the supplementary information exchange between national authorities, including an assessment of the automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS) and the SIS information campaigns 3 years after the regulation comes into force and every 4 years thereafter.
eu-LISA is responsible for:
Central SIS: its operational management, including quality checks on the data it contains, and all the tasks necessary to ensure it functions 24/7 every day of the year;
communication infrastructure: key aspects, notably supervision, security, coordination between member countries and providers, and budgetary and contractual issues;
SIRENE Bureaux: coordinating, managing and supporting testing activities, maintaining and updating technical specifications on supplementary information exchange between the Bureaux and the communication infrastructure, and managing technical change;
adopting the necessary measures to protect data and prevent unauthorised access or use, including security, business continuity and disaster recovery plans for Central SIS and the communication infrastructure;
applying professional secrecy and confidentiality rules, and maintenance of electronic logs on the same conditions as national authorities;
making publicly available via the EU’s Official Journal a list of national authorities authorised to search for data in SIS;
producing daily, monthly and annual statistics on the number of records per category of alerts, omitting any personal data. Its reports are made public.
Information campaign
The Commission, in cooperation with supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor, runs the campaign. This is launched when the legislation comes into force and is repeated at regular intervals, to inform the public on: the aims of SIS;the data it holds;the authorities with access to it;individuals’ data rights.
The Commission maintains a publicly available website with all relevant information on SIS.
EU countries, working with their supervisory authorities, must inform the public about SIS.
FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
              
They shall apply gradually and in entirety they shall be fully operational byno later than 28 December 2021. The date is to be decided by the Commission after the verification that the following conditions have been met:
implementing acts have been adopted;
national authorities have made the necessary arrangements to process SIS data and the exchange of supplementary information;
eu-LISA has successfully completed all its testing requirements.
BACKGROUND
While based on different pieces of legislation, the SIS is a single system for sharing data and requests among its members.
It is the most widely used and largest security and border management information sharing system in Europe. In 2018, it contained some 82.2 million records, had been accessed more than 6.1 billion times and secured 267,239 hits.
It operates in 30 European countries: all EU members apart from Cyprus and Ireland, and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

Summary 54:
Visa requirements for non-EU nationals
Visa requirements for non-EU nationals
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1806 — list of non-EU countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when entering the EU and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It lists the countries covered by this legislation and those that are exempt. The regulation repeals and codifies the much-amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation develops from the Schengen Agreement and Convention in which neither the United Kingdom (1) nor Ireland take part, and are therefore not bound by it or subject to its application.
The regulation lists, in its annex:
the non-EU countries and territories whose nationals must hold a visa; and
those countries and territories whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirements when entering the EU for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.
The regulation also allows for:
exceptions: the possibility for EU countries to grant exceptions to the visa requirement for certain categories of persons such as holders of diplomatic or service passports, civilian air and sea crews, school pupils in groups, holders of local traffic permits, and exemptions for recognised refugees and stateless persons who live in the EU and hold a travel document issued by their country of residence;
reciprocity: a mechanism allowing reciprocity if any visa-exempt non-EU country decides to impose a visa requirement on any EU country;
temporary suspension: a mechanism for the temporary suspension of visa exemptions in an emergency situation such as a substantial increase of migratory or security risk.
Decisions to amend the lists are on a case-by-case basis considering criteria including:
illegal immigration, public policy and security;
economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade;
the EU’s external relations with the relevant non-EU country, in particular relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms, regional coherence and reciprocity.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 18 December 2018. The Regulation (EU) 2018/1806 codifies and replaces Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and its subsequent amendments.

Eurojust (reform)
Eurojust (reform)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 — the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) — replacing and repealing Council Decision 2002/187/JHA
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to tackle serious cross-border crime more efficiently by changing the structure of Eurojust and enabling the College of Eurojust to concentrate more on operational matters.
It also takes into account the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and new rules for data protection in the European institutions and agencies. It also makes determining arrangements for involving the European Parliament and national parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust’s activities.
It replaces and repeals Council Decision 2002/187/JHA.
KEY POINTS
Role of Eurojust
Based on operations conducted and information supplied by the EU countries’ authorities and by Europol, the EPPO and OLAF, supporting and strengthening coordination and cooperation between national investigating and prosecuting authorities in relation to serious crime which Eurojust is competent to deal with (see below), where that crime: affects 2 or more EU countries; orrequires prosecution on common bases.
Carrying out its tasks at the request of the competent authorities of the EU countries, on its own initiative or at the request of the EPPO within the limits of the EPPO’s competence.
Eurojust’s operational tasks include:
cooperating closely with the EPPO on issues of competence;
cooperating and consulting with the European Judicial Network in criminal matters;
cooperating with EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well as networks established in the area of freedom, security and justice;
supporting EU countries’ action in combating forms of serious crime for which it is competent (e.g. terrorism; money laundering activities; trafficking in human beings; organ trafficking; drug and firearms trafficking);
providing operational, technical and financial support to EU countries’ cross-border operations and investigations, including to joint investigation teams.
Competence
Annex 1 of the Regulation sets out the forms of serious crime which Eurojust is competent to deal with in accordance with Article 3(1) of the Regulation.
When the EPPO assumes its investigative and prosecutorial tasks, Eurojust will not exercise its competence for crimes for which the EPPO exercises its competence, except: in cases involving EU countries not participating in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO; andat the request of those EU countries or at the request of the EPPO.
Eurojust will exercise its competence for crimes affecting the financial interests of the EU in cases involving EU countries which participate in enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the EPPO, but for which the EPPO is not competent or decides not to exercise its competence.
Eurojust will establish and maintain a close relationship with the EPPO based on mutual cooperation within their respective mandates.
Structure and organisation
Eurojust comprises: the national members;the College — consisting of all national members, plus 1 representative of the European Commission when the College is only carrying out its management functions, and not its operational functions;the Executive Board;the Administrative Director.
The terms of office of the national members and their deputies is 5 years, renewable once.
The Commission is represented on both the College and Executive Board.
The Executive Board is responsible for taking administrative decisions to ensure the proper functioning of Eurojust.
Processing of personal data
The updated rules take into account the new data protection rules for EU institutions and agencies.
EU countries are responsible for the accuracy of the data they transfer to Eurojust, for keeping those data up to date and for the legality of transmitting those data to Eurojust.
Eurojust is responsible for the accuracy of data provided by other data suppliers or resulting from its own analyses or data collection and for keeping those data up to date.
Eurojust should ensure that data are processed fairly and lawfully, and are collected and processed for a specific purpose.
A data subject must have the right of access to operational personal data about him or her which are processed by Eurojust.
Democratic control
To increase the transparency and democratic oversight of Eurojust, its activities will be jointly evaluated by the European Parliament and national parliaments.

The following, if committed intentionally, are a criminal offences: transferring or converting property (assets of any kind), knowing that it came from criminal activity, to hide or disguise its illicit origin or to assist anybody involved to evade the legal consequences of their actions;hiding or disguising the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of, property, knowing that it came from criminal activity;acquiring, possessing or using property knowing, at the time it was received, that it had come from criminal activity;aiding and abetting, inciting and attempting these offences.
Criminal activity (or ‘predicate offence’)
For the purposes of this directive, the following conduct is considered to be a criminal activity, i.e. relevant for the crime of money laundering: any kind of criminal involvement in the commissioning of any offence punishable, in accordance with national law, by imprisonment or a detention order for a minimum of more than 6 months or a maximum of more than 1 year; andin so far as not already covered by the category above, offences within a list of 22 designated categories of crime, including all the offences defined in EU legislation designated by this directive.
Additional factors
The offences extend to property derived from activity in another EU Member State or a non-EU country, where it would be considered a criminal activity if it had occurred domestically.
Member States must ensure that persons who committed, or were involved in, this criminal activity are subject to punishment. Additional factors include: criminal liability extends also to those who launder the proceeds of their own crimes (‘self-laundering’);a previous or simultaneous conviction for the criminal activity from which the property came is not a prerequisite for a conviction for money laundering;it is possible to convict without needing to establish all the facts about the criminal activity, including the perpetrator’s identity.
Aggravating circumstances which make offences more serious
These include instances where: the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation as defined in Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA; orthe offender committed the offence when carrying out their professional activities as ‘obliged entities’, as defined in Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 (see summary).
Member States may also choose to regard the following as aggravating circumstances: where the laundered property is of high value; orwhere the laundered property comes from racketeering, terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking or corruption.
Penalties and sanctions
Punishment must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States should impose a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 4 years and, where necessary, apply additional sanctions or measures, including measures holding legal entities liable, such as: exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid;exclusion from access to public funding, including tendering, grants and concessions;disqualification from carrying out commercial activities;judicial supervision;judicial winding-up orders;closing premises used for committing the offence;freezing or confiscating the property concerned.
Package of legislation
The directive is part of a package of legislation which includes Regulation (EU) 2018/1672 on controls on cash entering or leaving the EU, and complements and reinforces the application of Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.
Investigation tools and cooperation
Member States must ensure that effective investigative tools, such as those used in combating organised crime or other serious crimes, are available to those responsible for investigating or prosecuting the offences.
The directive also removes obstacles to judicial and police cooperation between Member States by clarifying which country has jurisdiction, and how countries cooperate, as well as how to involve Eurojust.
Money laundering affecting the EU’s financial interests
Directive (EU) 2017/1371 sets out rules concerning criminal offences and penalties on combatting fraud and other illegal activities detrimental to the Union’s financial interests (see summary). These activities include money laundering.
Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) (see summary) gives the EPPO powers in respect of the criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union that are set out in Directive (EU) 2017/1371.

Summary 57:
Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna
Multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1627 on a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It updates the rules of the European Union (EU) on applying the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which runs from 2007 to 2022, and is recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), an intergovernmental fishery organisation to which the EU is a contracting party.
It replaces and repeals Regulation (EC) No 302/2009.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation’s objective is to achieve a biomass* of bluefin tuna corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield by 2022 with at least a 60% probability of achieving that objective.
Each EU Member State must:
ensure that the fishing effort of its catching vessels and its traps are proportionate to the bluefin tuna fishing opportunities (total allowable catches allocated under Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 — the EU’s common fisheries policy) available to it in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean;
submit to the European Commission an annual fishing plan for its vessels and traps and annual fishing capacity and farming management plans that ensure its fishing capacity is in line with its allocated quota.
The regulation contains rules on:
minimum conservation reference sizes (generally, 30 kg or 115 cm fork length, although lower in certain fisheries);
incidental catches (parts of catches which are not targeted) — up to maximum of 5% of bluefin tuna weighing between 8 and 30 kg or with a fork length between 75 and 115 cm;
the use of (prohibited) aerial means, such as aircraft, to search for bluefin tuna;
records of both fishing and non-catching vessels and traps — Member States have to supply these to the Commission each year;
recording requirements — vessels must use logbooks to record information (Annex II, Part A);
designated ports for landing or transhipping bluefin tuna — Member States must send a list of these ports to the Commission each year;
caging operations, their authorisation and inspection;
monitoring and surveillance — vessel monitoring, national observer programmes and the ICCAT regional observer programme;
inspections and cross-checks — the ICCAT joint scheme of international inspection and Member States’ inspection plans;
marketing — trade, landing, import, export, pacing in cages for fattening or farming, re-export and transhipment of bluefin tuna are not permitted in the EU unless accompanied by accurate, complete and validated documentation, as set out in this regulation, Regulation (EU) No 640/2010 and Regulation (EC) No 1936/2001 (see summary);
catches in the cases of sport or recreational fishing: no more than one bluefin tuna may be caught per vessel,any bluefin tuna landed must be whole, gilled and/or gutted,there are measures to be introduced in Member States to ensure the release of bluefin tuna, especially juveniles, caught alive in the course of sport and recreational fishing,the sale of bluefin tuna caught during sport and recreational fishing is banned.
Amending
Regulation (EU) 2019/833
Regulation (EU) 2019/833 amends Regulation (EU) 2016/1627, requiring Member States:
to draw up an annual fishing capacity management plan to adjust the number of fishing vessels, in order to demonstrate that the fishing capacity is commensurate with the fishing opportunities allocated to the vessels in the relevant time period;
with a bluefin tuna quota, to transmit to the Commission by 31 January each year an annual farming management plan which the Commission then compiles and integrates into the EU plan which must be forwarded to the ICCAT Secretariat by 15 February of each year for discussion and approval by ICCAT;
in their annual farming management plan, to demonstrate that the total input capacity and the total farming capacity are commensurate with the estimated amount of bluefin tuna available for farming;
to make provisions for by-catch of bluefin tuna within their quota and to inform the Commission thereof when transmitting their annual fishing plans.
The amending regulation also sets new rules for fishing seasons for different types of vessels and on the level of by-catches of bluefin tuna (which must not exceed 20% of the total catches on board at the end of each fishing trip). The methodology used to calculate those by-catches, in relation to the total catch on board, must be clearly defined in Member States’ annual fishing plans.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 6 October 2016.

Summary 58:
Anti-dumping protection — shipbuilding industry
Anti-dumping protection — shipbuilding industry
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1035 — rules to ensure shipping vessels are not sold at prices below their true value
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It seeks to protect EU shipbuilders by ensuring that ships are not sold below their normal value* in the EU by their non-EU competitors.
It codifies and repeals Regulation (EC) No 385/96 which had been amended a number of times.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation translates into EU law the Shipbuilding Injurious Pricing (IPI) Code, which is annexed to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Shipbuilding Agreement of 1994.
The regulation is based on the principle that a harmful pricing charge may be levied on the builder of an injuriously priced* vessel whose sale to a buyer outside the country in which the vessel originates causes injury to EU industry. This means that an assessment needs to be made of the capability in the EU to produce a like vessel (i.e. of the same type, purpose and approximate size as the vessel under consideration and possessing characteristics closely resembling it).
The regulation applies to all self-propelled sea-going vessels of 100 gross tonnes and above, used for transportation of goods or passengers or for the performance of a specialised service (for example, ice breakers and dredgers). It also covers tugboats of 365 kW and above.
The regulation lays down:
detailed rules on how to calculate normal value;
guidance as to the possible relevant factors to determine whether the injuriously priced sale has caused material injury or is threatening to cause injury. EU market conditions need to be taken into account in order to demonstrate that the price level of the sale concerned is responsible for injury sustained by the EU industry;
conditions — both procedural and substantive — for an EU shipbuilder  to lodge a complaint against injurious pricing, including the extent to which it should be supported by the EU shipbuilding industry;
procedures for the European Commission to reject complaints or initiate proceedings;
rules and procedures governing the Commission’s investigation, such as: how interested parties should make themselves known,present their views and submit information within specified time limits, if such views and information are to be taken into account;
rules on the termination of cases. Whether or not an injurious pricing charge is imposed on a shipbuilder, an investigation should be terminated no later than 1 year from the date of its initiation or the date of delivery of the vessel, whichever is the later. The investigation may be terminated without imposing an injurious pricing charge if the sale of the injuriously priced vessel is definitively and unconditionally voided or if an alternative equivalent remedy is accepted;
rules preventing vessels built by shipbuilders who are subject to sanctions from loading and unloading in EU ports;
rules allowing the Commission to carry out visits to verify information about injurious pricing and injury;
rules on confidentiality to ensure that parties’ business secrets are not divulged in the course of the investigation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from the date on which the Shipbuilding Agreement enters into force.
BACKGROUND
              
The goal of the Shipbuilding Agreement is to establish, in a legally binding manner, normal, i.e. subsidy and dumping-free, competitive conditions in the shipbuilding industries of OECD countries. The agreement has not, as yet, come into force.
For more information, see:
Shipbuilding sector (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Normal value: the price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for a like vessel by an independent buyer in the exporting country. When there are no sales of like vessels in the ordinary course of trade, or where, because of the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessel is calculated on the basis of the export price of a like vessel, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate non-EU country, provided that this price is representative. If such sales to any appropriate non-EU country do not exist or do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value of the like vessels are calculated on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and for profits.
Injuriously priced: where the export price of the vessel sold is less than a comparable price for a like vessel, when sold to a buyer of the exporting country under normal trading conditions.

Responsible trade in minerals from high-risk or conflict areas
Responsible trade in minerals from high-risk or conflict areas
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/821 on the obligations of importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold from conflict-affected and high-risk areas
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The European Union (EU) regulation aims to:
ensure that EU importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) meet international responsible sourcing standards set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);
ensure that global and EU smelters and refiners* source 3TG responsibly;
help break the link between conflict and the illegal exploitation of minerals;
help put an end to the exploitation and abuse of local communities, including mine workers, and support local development.
KEY POINTS
In politically unstable areas, trade in minerals such as 3TG can be used to finance armed groups, lead to forced labour and other human rights abuses, and support corruption and money laundering.
These conflict minerals are then used in everyday products, such as mobile phones, cars or jewellery.
Due diligence
The term due diligence means to act with reasonable care and investigate an issue before making a decision. It is an ongoing, proactive and reactive process by which companies put in place systems and processes to identify, manage and report on risks in their supply chains.
For the minerals covered by the regulation, it means that companies must check that what they buy is sourced responsibly and does not contribute to conflict or other related illegal activities.
Companies that practise due diligence initially check how risky it is to source raw materials from a fragile or conflict-affected area. They assess the likelihood that these raw materials could be financing conflict, forced labour or other risks set out in the regulation. By checking their supply chains, they can make sure that they manage these risks responsibly.
The regulation builds on the 2011 OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, which sets the international benchmark for supply chain due diligence, and the 2014 joint communication ‘Responsible sourcing of minerals originating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas: Towards an integrated EU approach’.
Under the regulation, EU mineral importers must:
identify and assess the risks in their mineral supply chain;
implement a strategy to respond to these risks;
carry out an independent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence;
report annually on their policies and practices for responsible sourcing.
The competent authorities of the EU Member States must carry out checks to ensure that EU mineral and metal importers comply with their due diligence obligations.
Supply chain due diligence schemes
Governments, industry associations and groups of interested organisations with due diligence schemes in place may apply to have their schemes recognised by the European Commission as complying with the regulation. A delegated act, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/429 sets out the methodology and criteria allowing the Commission to assess whether supply chain due diligence schemes concerning 3TG meet the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/821, and to recognise such schemes.
The Commission will establish a register of recognised supply chain due diligence schemes, publicly available on the internet, and a list of global responsible smelters and refiners.
Guidelines
In consultation with the European External Action Service and the OECD, the Commission has prepared non-binding guidelines for economic operators that explain how best to apply the criteria for the identification of conflict-affected and high-risk areas. Recommendation (EU) 2018/1149 provides in its Annex non-binding guidelines for the identification of conflict-affected and high-risk areas and other supply chain risks under Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Review
By 1 January 2023 and every 3 years thereafter, the Commission will review the operation, effectiveness and impact of the new system, and will propose new measures in order to ensure a continuing responsible global supply chain for minerals.
Amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/821
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1588 amends Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2017/821 by setting volume thresholds for tantalum or niobium ores and concentrates, gold ores and concentrates, tin oxides and hydroxides, and tantalates and carbides of tantalum.

Intellectual property rights — customs enforcement
Intellectual property rights — customs enforcement
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 608/2013 on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The regulation provides revised procedural rules for customs authorities to enforce intellectual property rights (IPR) on goods liable to customs supervision or customs control. It replaces Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003.
KEY POINTS
              
This regulation particularly covers goods in the following situations:
when declared for release for free circulation, export or re-export;
when entering or leaving the customs territory of the EU;
when the goods are suspended from customs clearance or are in a free zone or free warehouse*.
It sets out procedures for applications to determine whether an IPR has been infringed. For the purposes of the regulation, an IPR could include:
a trade mark;
a design;
a copyright under national or EU law;
a geographical indication (such as Champagne or Parma ham);
a patent under national or EU law;
a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products;
a supplementary protection certificate for pesticides;
an plant variety right under national or EU law;
a semiconductor product design under national or EU law;
an IPR that protects inventions under national or EU law;
a trade name protected as an exclusive IPR under national or EU law.
The regulation:
sets out the conditions for customs action where goods are merely suspected of infringing IPRs;
sets out measures to be taken against goods that have been found to infringe IPRs;
expands the range of IPR infringements covered and reinforces the competence of customs authorities to control all goods under customs supervision — this does not apply to non-commercial goods in travellers’ personal luggage;
ensures that high-quality information is provided to customs to enable a comprehensive assessment of the risk of IPR infringement;
sets out the legal basis for a central database for recording the applications for customs action and detentions of IPR-infringing goods as well as the exchange of information between customs authorities.
To reduce administrative burden, the regulation:
sets out a common procedure for all kinds of IPR infringements falling within the scope of the regulation, under which goods may be destroyed without the need for the rightsholder to initiate legal proceedings, on condition that: the rightsholder confirms in writing that in their conviction there is an infringement and that they agree to their destruction, andthe declarant or holder of the goods does not object to destruction;
states that the procedure for small consignments applies only on prior request from the applicant and that the customs authorities may require the applicant to cover the costs — a small consignment is defined as a postal or express courier consignment, which either contains three units or fewer or weighs less than 2 kg.
In addition, the regulation:
stipulates that national laws apply when granting the right to be heard of the persons concerned by the detention of goods;
broadens and clarifies the cases where the rightsholder may use the information that customs disclose following a detention of goods;
includes rules on data collection, processing, data retention periods and the exercise of rights and responsibilities in relation to existing legislation on data protection.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014, with some exceptions.
BACKGROUND
              
A Commission notice relates to the trade mark package adopted in 2015:

European Social Fund Plus — ESF+ (2021-2027)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The Regulation establishes the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and lays down the fund’s objectives, its budget for 2021-2027, the methods of implementation, the forms of European Union (EU) funding and the rules for providing such funding.
KEY POINTS
              
The ESF+ integrates the former European Social Fund, the youth employment initiative, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived and the EU programme for employment and social innovation.
Strands
The ESF+ consists of 2 strands:
the shared management* strand; and
the employment and social innovation (EaSI) strand under direct* and indirect management*.
Objectives
The ESF+ has 2 general objectives.
To help EU Member States and regions achieve high employment levels, fair social protection and a skilled and resilient workforce ready for the future, as well as inclusive and fair societies that aim to eradicate poverty and deliver on the principles set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights.
To support, complement and add value to the policies of Member States to ensure equal opportunities, equal access to the labour market, fair and quality working conditions, social protection and inclusion.
Priority areas
The ESF+ will focus on a number of priority areas, including:
supporting young people who have been particularly affected by the socioeconomic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic by providing resources to help them get a qualification, a quality job and improve their education and skills;
helping children in need by allocating resources to targeted actions aimed at combating child poverty and supporting the most vulnerable in society suffering from job losses and income reductions, including with the provision of food and basic material assistance to the most deprived;
reskilling and upskilling people for the transition to a green and digital economy and improving the quality of education and training systems;
promoting gender equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination;
building capacity for social partners and civil-society organisations;
promoting social innovation across the EU through transnational cooperation;
providing direct support to social innovation through the EaSI strand.
Allocation of resources
The regulation includes certain minimum requirements for the allocation of ESF+ shared management resources by Member States:
at least 25% to foster social inclusion;
at least 3% to support the most deprived persons;
Member States whose average rate of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion for 2017-2019 was above the EU average must allocate at least 5% of their resources to tackling child poverty;
Member States whose average rate of young people aged 15-29 not in employment, education or training in 2017-2019 was above the EU average must allocate at least 12.5% of their resources to targeted actions and structural reforms to support youth employment, vocational education and training, in particular apprenticeships, and the transition from school to work, pathways to reintegrate into education or training and second chance education, in particular in the context of implementing schemes under the youth guarantee.
Budget and management
The ESF+ has a budget of just under €88 billion (2018 prices) for 2021-2027.
The majority of funding (€87.3 billion in 2018 prices) under the ESF+ is allocated under the shared management strand with the Member States. The ESF+ managing authorities in each Member State will dispense the money to relevant projects run by a range of public and private organisations.
The European Commission directly manages a smaller share (around €676 million in 2018 prices) under the EaSI strand.
To accelerate the transfer and facilitate the scaling up of innovative solutions, €175 million are allocated for transnational cooperation.
Common EU rules on the management of funds, applicable to all cohesion policy funds, are set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (see summary).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied partially, for the EaSI strand, since 1 January 2021, and fully since 1 July 2021.
BACKGROUND
              
For more information, see:
European Social Fund Plus (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Shared management: the EU entrusts the Member States with implementing programmes at the national or the regional level. The Member States’ administrations (at national, regional and local levels) choose which projects to finance and are responsible for their day-to-day management. The Member State is primarily responsible for setting up a management and control system and for preventing, detecting and correcting irregularities. Working together with the Member States, the Commission makes sure that the projects are successfully concluded, and that the money is well spent.
Direct management: the European Commission launches the calls for proposals to award grants to projects and calls for tenders to award service and/or supply contracts.
Indirect management: a managing authority is chosen by the European Commission to manage the project concerned on its behalf.

European Solidarity Corps programme 2021-2027
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/888 establishing the European Solidarity Corps programme
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The European Solidarity Corps (ESC) programme aims to enhance the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities, primarily volunteering, as a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity, democracy, European identity and active citizenship in the European Union (EU) and beyond.
KEY POINTS
The ESC replaces the European Voluntary Service, the EU volunteering programme, with an increased focus on social issues.
The programme is required to be consistent and complementary with other EU policies, in particular with the EU youth strategy and with Erasmus+ established by Regulation (EU) 2021/817 (see summary).
Specific objective
The ESC programme aims to provide young people, including those with fewer opportunities, with easily accessible opportunities for engagement in solidarity activities that induce positive societal changes in the EU and beyond, while also improving and properly validating their competences, and facilitating their continuous engagement as active citizens.
Action strands
The programme sets up two strands of action for the participation of young people:
solidarity activities* — actions envisaged under this strand include volunteering, solidarity projects and networking opportunities;
humanitarian aid activities, the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps — actions must contribute to providing needs-based humanitarian aid aimed at preserving life, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity, while also strengthening the capacity and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-affected communities.
The programme will be implemented through work programmes adopted by the European Commission by means of implementing acts.
Participation
The ESC offers voluntary activities to young people between 18 and 30 years of age. The upper age limit for volunteers in the field of humanitarian aid is 35, with the possibility of hiring experts and coaches without an upper age limit.
Projects can last up to 12 months.
The programme allows young people to volunteer for more than one project, provided that the total time on the programme is not more than 12 months.
At the end of the experience, the young people will be given a ‘Youthpass’ explaining the activities carried out while volunteering, showing the skills acquired by the volunteers and reflecting their learning process.
Budget
The programme runs from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027, the duration of the multiannual financial framework.
The financial envelope for the implementation of the programme for 2021-2027 is set at €1.009 billion in current prices.

European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (2021-2027)
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (2021-2027)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/691 on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The aim of the regulation is to renew the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the period covered by the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027. Subsequently, the fund has been renamed the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF).
It offers support for employees and self-employed persons who have lost their jobs because of major restructuring events.
KEY POINTS
Mission and objectives
The EGF is a solidarity fund financing active labour market measures (such as training, job searches and business start-ups) when there are unexpected and significant job losses arising from major restructuring events.
It is an emergency fund outside of the MFF ceilings.
Intervention criteria
EGF support is triggered if more than 200 (reduced from the previous 500 during the 2014-2020 period) jobs are lost — salaried or self-employed — over a 4-month period (for dismissals in the same enterprise, or dismissals in the same region), or over a 6-month period in an enterprise or for a group of businesses (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) in the same sector and geographical area. For dismissals in an enterprise, this threshold may include suppliers and downstream producers.
In small labour markets, applications that do not meet this threshold may be accepted if the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. Exceptionally, this could also apply to larger labour markets, but the financial help for all such cases in a given year must not exceed 15% of the annual EGF ceiling.
The EGF does not apply to workers dismissed as a result of budgetary cuts by an EU Member State (public sector dismissals).
Eligible measures
A financial contribution from the EGF may be made for active labour market policies forming part of a coordinated package of personalised services, designed to reintegrate the displaced worker into employment or self-employment. This could include the following:
training and retraining, including in information and communication technology and other digital skills;
certification of acquired knowledge and skills;
job-search assistance;
targeted group activities;
occupational guidance and advisory services;
mentoring;
outplacement assistance;
promoting entrepreneurship;
aid for self-employment, business creation, employee takeovers and cooperation activities;
time-limited measures (no more than 35% of the total package), such as allowances for mobility, childcare, training, subsistence and carers, along with employers’ recruitment incentives — on the condition that the beneficiaries actively participate in job-searches or training.
The dissemination of skills required in the digital industrial age and in a resource-efficient economy shall be considered as a horizontal element in the design of the coordinated packages.
The EGF will not support measures that are the responsibility of enterprises under national law or collective agreements. Member States may apply for aid for preparatory, management, information and publicity, and control and reporting activities. Approved EGF applications are valid for 24 months.
Investment in self-employment, business start-ups or employee takeovers may not exceed €22,000 per beneficiary. The financial contribution from the EGF is limited to what is necessary to provide temporary, one-off support for targeted beneficiaries.
Applications
Member States must make an EGF application within 12 weeks of the reference period in which the job losses occur, to be analysed by the European Commission, which proposes the mobilisation of the EGF to the budgetary authority (European Parliament and Council). This is necessary as the EGF is outside and above the MFF ceilings.
The decision on whether to mobilise EGF funding is taken by the budgetary authority within 6 weeks of receipt of the Commission’s proposal.
Co-financing rate
The co-financing rate of the EGF is aligned with the highest co-financing rate of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) in the Member State concerned, but will not be lower than 60%.
Repeal
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 with effect from 1 January 2021.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2021, with the exception of Article 15 (budgetary procedure and implementation), which has applied since 3 May 2021.
BACKGROUND
The European Monitoring Centre on Change assists the Commission and the Member States with qualitative and quantitative analyses to help assess trends of globalisation, technological and environmental changes, restructuring and the use of the EGF.
The European Pillar of Social Rights, created as a response to social challenges in Europe, acts as a guiding framework for the EGF allowing the EU to put the principles into practice in the case of major restructuring events.
The EU Quality Framework for anticipation of change and restructuring is the EU policy instrument that sets the framework for best practice for anticipating and dealing with corporate restructuring.

Lobbying regulation — the EU mandatory transparency register
Lobbying regulation — the EU mandatory transparency register
SUMMARY OF:
Interinstitutional Agreement on a mandatory transparency register
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT?
              
The agreement aims to reinforce a common transparency culture and set high standards of transparent and ethical interest representation at the European Union (EU) level by establishing:
a joint framework for cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (‘the signatory institutions’) regarding their dealings with interest representatives*;
a transparency register (‘the register’), in which interest representatives must register in order to be able to carry out certain interest representation activities (principle of conditionality);
a code of conduct that interest representatives must observe and information requirements that they must comply with in order to be eligible for registration;
a procedure for monitoring the application of the code of conduct, investigating alleged violations of that code and taking action in the event of non-observance.
KEY POINTS
              
The agreement:
applies to various activities (‘covered activities’) carried out by interest representatives to influence the formulation or implementation of EU policy or legislation, or the decision-making processes of the signatory institutions or other EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies;
identifies covered activities including: organising or participating in meetings, conferences and events, and engaging in any similar contacts with EU institutions,contributing to, or participating in, consultations, hearings or similar initiatives,organising communication campaigns, platforms, networks and grassroots initiatives,preparing or commissioning policy and position papers, amendments, opinion polls, surveys, open letters, other communication or information material, or commissioning and carrying out research;
exempts a range of activities, such as: the provision of legal and other professional advice to clients in specific circumstances,activities by employers and trade unions acting as participants in social dialogue,activities carried out by individuals acting in a strictly personal capacity and not in association with others,spontaneous, purely private or social meetings and meetings taking place in the context of an administrative procedure established by the treaties or legal acts of the EU;
does not apply to the activities of the following bodies: EU Member State public authorities, including their national and subnational embassies and permanent representations,intergovernmental organisations and their agencies and bodies;
does not apply either, subject to some exceptions, to activities of the following bodies: EU, national or subnational associations and networks of public authorities,public authorities, including diplomatic missions and embassies, of non-EU countries,political parties,churches and religious associations or communities, and philosophical and non-confessional organisations.
The signatory institutions agree to apply the principle of conditionality, whereby registration in the register is a necessary precondition for interest representatives to be able to carry out certain covered activities. To that end, they adopt conditionality measures by means of individual decisions on the basis of their powers of internal organisation. The signatory institutions may further adopt complementary transparency measures to encourage registration and strengthen the joint framework.
Interest representatives that apply to be entered in the register must:
provide a wide range of information listed in Annex II to the agreement and agree to make that information publicly available, notably: their name, contact details, staff numbers, legal representative and interests represented, along with the organisations or entities of which the registrant is a member and the registrant’s members,the EU legislative proposals, policies or initiatives they target, membership of Commission expert groups and other EU-supported forums and platforms or of intergroups or other unofficial groupings of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs),financial information, including, within specific bands, annual costs of their activities, costs for intermediaries carrying out activities on their behalf, revenue from individual clients (for intermediaries) or total budget and sources of funding (for registrants that do not represent commercial interests);
observe the code of conduct set out in Annex I to the agreement, with its 16 rules and principles, which requires that registrants: declare the interests and objectives they promote and specify the clients or members whom they represent,not obtain or try to obtain information dishonestly or persuade MEPs, members of the Commission or EU staff to break the rules and standards of behaviour applicable to them,not abuse their registration for commercial gain,ensure the information they provide for registration purposes is complete, up to date and accurate.
The agreement establishes:
a management board of the register — consisting of the secretaries-general of the signatory institutions — to: determine the register’s priorities and the budget and share required for the implementation of those priorities,adopt an annual report and oversee the overall implementation of the agreement;
a secretariat of the register — consisting of the heads of unit responsible for transparency issues in the signatory institutions and their staff — to manage the register, which involves: establishing guidelines for registrants and providing help-desk support to applicants and registrants,deciding upon the eligibility of applicants and monitoring the content of the register,carrying out investigations and applying measures in accordance with the procedure in Annex III to the agreement.
The management board and the secretariat of the register are empowered to adopt, on behalf of the signatory institutions, individual decisions concerning applicants and registrants.
The signatory institutions ensure the secretariat of the register has the necessary human, administrative, technical and financial resources.
Other EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and Member States (for their permanent representations) may notify the management board of the register of measures they take to make certain activities conditional upon registration in the register or of any complementary transparency measures they take on a voluntary basis.
Conditionality and complementary transparency measures adopted by the signatory institutions and other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies or Member States (for their permanent representations) are made public on the website of the register.
The agreement replaces its 2014 predecessor and will be reviewed no later than 2 July 2025.
FROM WHEN DOES THE AGREEMENT ENTER INTO FORCE?
              
It has been in force since 1 July 2021.
BACKGROUND
The agreement is complemented by a political statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: recognising the importance of the principle of conditionality and emphasising the aim of the three institutions’ coordinated approach, namely to reinforce a common transparency culture, while setting high standards of transparent and ethical interest representation at the EU level;listing the conditionality and complementary transparency measures already in place for each of the signatory institutions that are acknowledged to be consistent with the agreement.
In addition, the Council adopted a decision on 6 May 2021 establishing the rules for contact between its general secretariat and interest representatives.
The agreement replaces a 2014 agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission (the Council was an observer) on a transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policymaking and policy implementation.
It expands the scope of the previous register and makes the registration of interest representatives in the transparency register a prerequisite for certain interest representation activities, such as meeting certain decision-makers or staff of the signatory institutions or getting access to the institutions’ premises.

Interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation, sound financial management and own resources
Interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation, sound financial management and own resources
SUMMARY OF:
Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters and sound financial management
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS INTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT?
              
Over the period of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the interinstitutional agreement (IIA) aims to:
set out rules on cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission on budgetary matters, in line with the principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management;
improve the functioning of the European Union (EU) annual budgetary procedure and the cooperation between the 3 relevant institutions during this procedure;
implement cooperation and draw up a roadmap towards introducing new own resources. These may contribute to covering the repayment of the expected expenditure mobilised through the EU Recovery Instrument under Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (see summary), which supports recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.
KEY POINTS
              
The agreement is made up of 4 parts.
Part I: The MFF and special instruments
This part contains complementary details regarding the 2021-2027 MFF, including the mobilisation procedures of special instruments not included in the MFF:
the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund;
the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve, designed to tackle, among other things, major disasters in the EU or in candidate countries under the EU Solidarity Fund (see summary);
the Brexit Adjustment Reserve;
the Single Margin Instrument;
the Flexibility Instrument.
Part II: Interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters
This part aims to improve the cooperation between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission in relation to budgetary matters. This includes the following.
The 3 institutions agree to facilitate the adoption of a proposed new MFF or a proposed revision to the current MFF by taking necessary measures, such as meetings and exchange of information.
Budgetary transparency means the Commission must prepare an annual report on: the assets and liabilities of the EU, including those arising from borrowing and lending operations,EU financial interventions which are not included in the EU’s general budget (such as the previous European Development Fund),the expenditure incurred by Member States in the context of enhanced cooperation, where it is not included in the general budget,how the EU budget contributes to: the fight against climate change,halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity,promoting equality between women and men, and rights and equal opportunities for all,the implementation of the UN sustainable development goals. The Commission will also prepare an annual report on the implementation of the European Union Recovery Instrument (NextGenerationEU).
How financial rules are incorporated in legislative acts and how these are dealt with in the annual budget procedure.
Specific rules on expenditure relating to fisheries agreements and the financing of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
Part III: Sound financial management of EU funds
This part deals with financial programming, which means the Commission must submit to the Council and the Parliament financial programming for the MFF twice a year (with some category exemptions), structured by heading, policy area and budget line, and should identify the legislation in force, distinguishing between multiannual programmes and annual actions.
This part also deals with the cooperation procedures which apply when a new agency is created, or when an amendment to a legal act concerning an agency would have an impact on that agency’s resources. A similar procedure applies when the creation of a new European school is envisaged.
Part IV: Protecting the EU budget: data on beneficiaries
To enhance the protection of the EU budget and the EU Recovery Instrument against fraud and irregularities, the institutions agree to introduce standardised measures to collect, compare and aggregate data on the final recipients and beneficiaries of EU funding for the purposes of controls and audits. In particular:
to ensure effective controls and audits, it is necessary to collect data on those ultimately benefitting, directly or indirectly, from EU funding under shared management and from projects and reforms supported under the Recovery and Resilience Facility;
the Commission will make available an integrated and interoperable information and monitoring system, including a single data-mining and risk-scoring tool to access and analyse the data. The Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and other EU investigative and control bodies should have access to the data to exercise their supervision over Member States’ audits.
Two Annexes form an integral part of the IIA.
Annex I lays down additional detailed rules for cooperation between the institutions during the budgetary procedure. These cover:
agreement on a pragmatic calendar;
priority setting;
establishing the draft budget and updating of estimates;
specific decision-making procedures at different stages of the budget process;
amending budgets;
the issue of outstanding commitments (not yet translated into payments);
cooperation as regards the European Union Recovery Instrument.
Annex II sets out principles of the interinstitutional cooperation in order to introduce new own resources with a view to covering the expected expenditure related to the repayment of NextGenerationEU.
As a first step, a new own resource will be introduced from 1 January 2021 made up of a share of revenues from national contributions, calculated on the weight of non-recycled plastic packaging waste.
Moreover, the Commission will propose to the Council the introduction of new own resources based on a digital levy and on a carbon border adjustment mechanism. The Commission will also review the Emissions Trading System in spring 2021 and propose to the Council a new own resource on that basis in June 2021.
These 3 new own resources are envisaged to be introduced by 1 January 2023, provided the necessary legislative procedures are completed. This would constitute the second step.
As a third step, the Commission aims to propose to the Council by June 2024 an additional new own resource. This proposal could take the form of a Financial Transaction Tax and a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector or a new common corporate tax base. These are envisaged to be introduced by 2026, provided the necessary legislative procedures are completed.
FROM WHEN DOES THE AGREEMENT APPLY?
              
The IIA entered into force on 16 December 2020.
BACKGROUND
              
In December 2020, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded an IIA on budgetary discipline, cooperation on budgetary matters and sound financial management as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources.
The IIA was adopted in parallel to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) Regulation, the EU’s 7-year plan covering the 2021-2027 period.

EU Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU
EU Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It sets up the European Union Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU to support the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and sets out how it will operate.
KEY POINTS
              
NextGenerationEU is a temporary recovery instrument worth up to €750 billion in 2018 prices. It is at the heart of the European Union (EU) response to the COVID-19 crisis and aims to support the recovery and build a greener, more digital and more resilient future, in particular to reinvigorate potential for sustainable growth and employment in order to support EU Member States’ transition towards a green and digital economy.
The instrument will also help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the COVID-19 crisis and build a post-COVID-19 Europe that is better equipped to deal with current and forthcoming challenges.
The centrepiece of NextGenerationEU is the allocation of financing to the Recovery and Resilience Facility — by offering grants and loans to support reforms and investments in the Member States with a total value of €672.5 billion in 2018 prices:
up to €312.5 billion will be provided in the form of grants;
up to €360 billion will provide EU loans to individual Member States. These loans will be repaid by those Member States.
In addition, NextGenerationEU will reinforce several EU programmes as follows:
Cohesion, under the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), to help tackle the economic consequences of COVID-19 in the first years of the recovery — with €47.5 billion;
Just Transition Fund with €10 billion;
Rural development with €7.5 billion;
InvestEU with €5.6 billion;
Union Civil Protection Mechanism, under rescEU, with €1.9 billion;
Horizon Europe, with €5 billion.
To finance NextGenerationEU, the Own Resources Decision (Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053) (see summary) will enable the European Commission to borrow on the capital markets on behalf of the EU. As set out by the Own Resources Decision, repayment can take place over the long term, at the latest until 2058. This will avoid placing immediate pressure on Member States’ national finances and enable them to focus their efforts on the recovery.
Additional information:
commitment appropriations* for all expenditure, apart from the €360 billion of loans, should be available as soon as the Own Resources Decision enters into force, with at least 60% committed by 31 December 2022 and any remaining amount by 31 December 2023;
decisions on granting the €360 billion in loans should be adopted by 31 December 2023;
specific conditions apply to the EU’s budgetary and investment guarantees.
The regulation does not apply to the United Kingdom.
The Commission shall submit a report to the Council by 31 October 2022 on how the funds allocated under this instrument are being used.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 23 December 2020.
BACKGROUND
              
With their combined €1.8 trillion, NextGenerationEU, and the long-term EU budget 2021-2027, form the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget.
The package will also help rebuild a post-COVID-19 Europe, which will be greener, more digital, more resilient and better equipped for the current and forthcoming challenges.
In addition to this Regulation, the package also includes:
the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093) — see summary;
the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline (see summary);
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the EU budget — see summary;
the Own Resources Decision (Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053).
KEY TERMS
              
Commitment appropriations: total cost of legal obligations (contracts, grants agreements/decisions) that may be signed in the current financial year.

Stability and Growth Pact enforcement
Stability and Growth Pact enforcement
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1173/2011 — the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It sets out a gradual system of sanctions for euro area countries that either fail to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact or manipulate their economic statistics.
The rules are mainly designed to encouragegovernments to stick to their medium-term budgetary goals.
KEY POINTS
              
Euro area countries which:
fail to act toto correct a significant deviation of their structural budget deficit from what is required to achieve their medium-term objective, following a warning from the European Commission, may have to lodge with the Commission an interest-bearing deposit equivalent to 0.2% of their previous year’s gross domestic product (GDP);
are deemed to be in excessive deficit by the Council, may have to lodge with the Commission a non-interestbearing deposit equivalent to 0.2% of their previous year’s GDP;
do not act effectivelyto correct an excessive deficit, may be fined 0.2% of their previous year’s GDP.
The procedures for adopting the abovementioned sanctions are identical. Following a Council decision about the lack of effective action or establishing the existence of an excessive deficit, the Commission proposes the relevant sanction within 20 days. This is adopted unless a qualified majority of euro area countries rejects it. The Commission may recommend the Council reduce or cancel the sanction in the light of exceptional economic circumstances or following the reasoned request by the country concerned.
The Council, following a recommendation from the Commission, may also fine a euro area country up to 0.2% of its GDP if it intentionally, or by serious negligence, misrepresents its deficit and debt data.
Income generated from fines and non-interest-bearing deposits is transferred to the European Stability Mechanism to help euro area members requiring financial assistance.
The Commission, publishes a report every 5 years, starting from 14 December 2014, evaluating the:
effectiveness of this regulation in tackling potential risks to the proper functioning of the monetary union;
progress made in ensuring closer coordination and convergence of national economic policies and performance.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?

Summary 72:
Visa Code
Visa Code
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 establishing the EU’s Visa Code
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out procedures and conditions for issuing short-stay visas for visits to the Schengen area of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period.
It also sets out rules on airport transit visas.
KEY POINTS
Procedures and conditions for issuing visas
The European Union (EU) Member State that is the sole or main destination of the visit is responsible for examining the visa application. If the main destination cannot be determined, it becomes the responsibility of the country of first entry into the Schengen area.
Applications
A visa application may be submitted by the applicant, an accredited commercial intermediary or a professional, cultural, sports or educational association or institution on behalf of its members.
Applications must generally be submitted within 6 months to 15 days of the intended visit (9 months for seafarers).
A uniform visa (valid for the whole Schengen area) may be for multiple entries with a maximum validity of 5 years.
A visa with limited territorial validity (limited to particular Member States) may exceptionally be issued in cases where the applicant does not fulfil all the entry conditions, on humanitarian grounds, for reasons of national interest, because of international obligations, or in situations where other Schengen countries consulted object to the issuing of a visa.
Admissibility
After verifying whether the application is admissible (i.e. submitted following the rules), the competent authority must:
create an entry in the Visa Information System (VIS) under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008;
carry out a further examination of the application to check that the applicant: fulfils the entry conditions as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/399 setting out the Schengen Borders Code (see summary),does not pose a risk of illegal immigration or a threat to the security of the country, andintends to leave before the visa expires.
Under amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134, background checks on applicants would be reinforced before a decision is taken on granting a visa. Rules and procedures for searches in sensitive and non-sensitive EU databases containing security and migration information are set out. Once in effect, Member States would be required to collect biometric identifiers of the applicant comprising a facial image and 10 fingerprints (for storage in the VIS) and, at the time of submission of the first application and subsequently at least every 59 months thereafter, the applicant must appear in person.
If the application is inadmissible, the authority would have to:
return the application form and supporting documents without having examined them further;
destroy any biometric data collected; and
reimburse the visa fee.
Airport transit visas
Nationals of non-EU countries listed in Annex IV need an airport transit visa to pass through the international transit areas of airports in the Schengen area. In urgent cases of mass influx of illegal immigrants, any Member State may extend this requirement to nationals of other non-EU countries.
When applying for an airport transit visa, the applicant must present proof of the points of departure and destination, coherence of the itinerary and proof of the onward journey to the final destination.
Multiple-entry visas
Multiple-entry visas with long validity may be issued for one, two or multiple entries. The Visa Code sets out rules on the issuing of multiple entry visas with a progressively longer length of validity:
1 year, if the applicant has used three visas within the previous 2 years;
2 years, if the applicant has already used a 1-year multiple-entry visa within the previous 2 years;
5 years, if the applicant has already used a 2-year multiple-entry visa within the previous 3 years.
Airport transit visas and visas limited to particular countries are not taken into account when taking decisions on the issuing of multiple-entry visas with a long validity.
Visas issued at the external borders
Exceptionally, a visa application for a maximum stay of 15 days, or to cover the time needed for transit, may be applied for at the external border of the Schengen country of destination.
A non-EU national for whom the verification of hits resulting from automated checks in EU databases has not been completed is not, in principle, issued a visa at the external border. However, a visa with limited territorial validity for the territory of the issuing Member State may be issued for such persons in exceptional cases.
Decisions on visa applications
The authority assesses whether the entry conditions set out in the Schengen Borders Code are met.
A visa is refused if the applicant: presents a false travel document;gives inadequate justification for the intended stay;provides insufficient proof of means for the stay or for the return home;has been the subject of an alert in the Schengen information system set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 (see summary) for the purpose of refusing entry;is considered a threat to the public policy, internal security, public health or internal relations of EU countries;presents insufficient travel medical insurance.
The general deadline for a decision is a maximum of 15 days, which may be extended up to a maximum of 45 days in individual cases, notably where further scrutiny of the application is needed.
A decision on refusal and the reasons on which it is based is notified to the applicant using the standard form set out in Annex VI.
Persons whose visa has been refused have the right to appeal.
Cooperation on readmission
The European Commission assesses cooperation by non-EU countries on readmission of irregular migrants, taking into account border management and prevention, control of migrant smuggling and the transit of irregular migrants.
Where a non-EU country is not cooperating, the Commission may submit a proposal for a Council decision to temporarily apply certain rules in a restrictive manner. Conversely, where a country is cooperating sufficiently, certain rules may be applied in a more generous manner.
Respect for human dignity and fundamental rights
Amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 also introduces stipulations that Member States’ consular and central authorities’ staff must fully respect human dignity and the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights when performing their duties. They shall not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
Amendments and repeals
Amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 also amends the VIS regulation set up under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 (see summary) and the Schengen Borders Code, as well as Articles 9–17 of the convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and the Common Consular Instructions.
The regulation has been successively amended by Regulations (EU) No 977/2011, (EU) No 154/2012, (EU) No 610/2013, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2019/1155 and (EU) 2021/1134.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 has applied since 5 April 2010.
It should be noted that amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 are expected to be applied only from 2024.

Summary 73:
Common rules for the collection of census data on population and housing
Common rules for the collection of census data on population and housing
SUMMARY OF
Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 on population and housing censuses
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It sets out common rules for the provision of census statistics on population and housing in the EU.
It aims to achieve comprehensive and flexible dissemination of census data as well as transparency regarding their quality.
KEY POINTS
Data submission
EU countries are required to submit to the European Commission (Eurostat) data on the population covering:
various demographic, social and economic characteristics of persons, families and households;
housing at a national, regional and local level.
These data are as set out in the regulation’s annex and its implementing regulations.
Data sources
The regulation sets out the data sources on which EU countries must base their statistics. These include:
conventional censuses;
register-based censuses;
a combination of conventional censuses and sample surveys;
a combination of register-based censuses and sample surveys;
a combination of register-based censuses and conventional censuses;
a combination of register-based censuses, sample surveys and conventional censuses; and
appropriate surveys with rotating samples (rolling censuses).
Data protection
EU countries must take all measures necessary to meet the requirements of data protection. Their own data protection rules are not affected by this regulation.
Data transmission
Each EU country must determine a date to which its data refer (a reference date), which must fall in the reference year. The first reference year is 2011. Reference years fall on the first year of each decade.
EU countries must inform Eurostat of any revision or correction of the statistics transmitted as well as of any changes in the chosen data sources and methodology. This must be done no later than 1 month before the release of the revised data.
EU countries must provide Eurostat with final, validated and aggregated data and metadata within 27 months of the end of the reference year.
To fulfil the requirements of this regulation, in 2010 the European Commission adopted a first programme of the statistical data and of the metadata to be transmitted for the reference year 2011 and, in 2017, it adopted a second programme for the reference year 2021.
EU countries transmit to Eurostat the data in accordance with the EU law on data transmission subject to statistical confidentiality as set out in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. They must ensure that the transmitted data do not permit the direct identification of the statistical units. Transmission is in electronic format and is in accordance with the specifications agreed by the European Statistical System Committee, the committee that assists and advises the Commission (Eurostat).
Quality assessment
EU countries must ensure that the data sources and the methodology used to satisfy the requirements of the regulation meet the essential features of population and housing censuses as laid down in the regulation, i.e.:
individual enumeration,
simultaneity,
universality within a defined territory,
availability of small-area data, and
defined periodicity.
EU countries must provide Eurostat with a report on the quality of the data transmitted, outlining the extent to which the chosen data sources and methodology meet the essential features of population and housing censuses.
The Commission assesses the quality of the data transmitted. In cooperation with the EU countries’ competent authorities, it provides methodological recommendations designed to ensure the quality of the data and the metadata produced, in particular acknowledging the Conference of European Statisticians — Recommendations for the 2010 Censuses of Population and Housing.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 2 September 2008.
BACKGROUND
              
For the EU to be able to develop its regional, social and environmental policies, it needs to have at its disposal comparable and reliable data on population and the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of persons.

Vice-Presidents have specific responsibilities and replace the President when necessary.
Questors are responsible for administrative and financial matters directly concerning MEPs.
The Bureau consists of the President and 14 Vice-Presidents. It decides on financial, organisational and administrative matters affecting the Parliament.
The Conference of Presidents consists of the President and the Chairs of the political groups (see below). It organises the Parliament’s political work and decides legislative planning.
The Conference of Committee Chairs consists of the chairs of all standing and special parliamentary committees. It may make recommendations on committee work and plenary session agendas.
The Conference of Delegation Chairs consists of the chairs of all Parliament delegations to parliaments elsewhere in the world. It may make recommendations on the work of delegations.
Political groups are formed by MEPs on the basis of their political affinities. A minimum of 23 MEPs, elected in at least a quarter of EU Member States, is required to form a group. They receive financial and administrative support depending on their size. Some MEPs do not belong to a political group. They receive support for their parliamentary activities.Individual MEPs from different political groups may form a cross-party intergroup on specific issues such as animal welfare or public health.
Legislative procedures
ordinary legislative procedures (1st, 2nd and 3rd readings), where Parliament acts as co-legislator with the Council;
consultation procedures, where Parliament submits an opinion on a draft legal act;
consent procedures, where Parliament’s agreement is necessary before adoption of a legal act.
In the course of those legislative procedures, Parliament pays specific attention to issues like the respect for fundamental rights, the legal basis, the delegation of legislative powers, the financial compatibility and the respect for subsidiarity.
Own-initiative procedures
In the case of legislative own-initiative reports, Parliament requests the European Commission to submit proposals (Rule 47) or submits proposals in the cases provided for by the Treaties (Rule 46).
Non-legislative reports
Parliament can also prepare non-legislative own-initiative reports on specific subject matters:
Constitutional matters, where rules cover the Parliament’s role when the EU’s treaties are amended, a new country joins the EU or an EU Member State decides to leave the EU.
Budgetary procedures, where rules cover both the consideration of the annual EU budget and its multiannual financial framework.
International agreements, where the Parliament’s approval or opinion is required for international agreements. It may also be consulted on aspects of the EU’s common foreign and security policy.
Relations with other EU institutions and bodies
The Parliament:
elects the Commission President and the whole Commission;
may adopt a motion of censure against the Commission;
is involved in appointments to institutions like the European Central Bank and the Court of Auditors.
Parliamentary questions
MEPs may table written questions to the:
the Council;
the Commission; or
the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
They can also table oral questions, which are followed by a debate, to the Council or the Commission.

Parliament keeps national parliaments regularly informed of its activities. MEPs and national MPs meet occasionally in the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs.
Sessions of Parliament
Parliament holds 4-day plenary part-sessions 12 times a year in Strasbourg and additional part-sessions in Brussels.
Detailed rules cover issues such as: speaking time;use of languages;distribution of documents;voting.
Committees
Standing committees prepare Parliament’s decisions at plenary level by submitting reports and other documents in their specific field of competence.
Special committees may be established for a given term and a specific subject area.
Committees of inquiry may be set up to investigate alleged contraventions of EU law or possible maladministration.
Interparliamentary delegations
Parliament establishes joint committees with national parliaments around the world and cooperates with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Petitions

The EU’s own resources
The EU’s own resources
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 on the system of own resources of the European Union
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
              
The decision sets out how the EU’s annual budget is financed by:
amending some existing rules;
updating the own resources ceiling;
introducing a new income source (based on plastic packaging waste that is not recycled);
allowing the European Commission to borrow on capital markets for the sole purpose of tackling the COVID crisis.
KEY POINTS
              
The annual EU budget is financed by EU Member States from the following own resources:
traditional income sources: although they used to be the main source of income before 1970, these are now limited to customs duties on imports;
value added tax (VAT): a uniform rate of 0.30% is applied to each Member State’s harmonised VAT base, which is capped at 50% of its Gross National Income;
Gross National Income (GNI)*: a uniform rate on national GNI to be agreed annually (with annual lump sum reductions for Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden);
plastic packaging waste: a uniform rate of €0.80 per kg is applied to the difference between the quantity of plastic packaging waste generated and recycled (with annual lump sum reductions for 17 Member States whose GNI is below EU average).
The maximum size of the annual budget (‘own resources ceiling’) is increased from 1.20% to 1.40% of EU GNI for payments* and to 1.46% for commitments* reflecting in particular the departure of the UK from the EU.
The following special conditions apply to measures to tackle the COVID-19 crisis through the European Union Recovery Instrument (EURI) — Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (see summary):
the Commission may borrow up to €750,000 million (2018 prices) on capital markets;
the sum is divided into €360,000 million for loans and €390,000 million for expenditure;
repayments of the amount borrowed are made from the EU budget, starting before the end of the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework (Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 — see summary) and fully completed by 31 December 2058 at the latest;
the Commission administers the borrowing operations and keeps the European Parliament and the Council regularly informed about its debt management strategy;
the ceilings for payments (1.40%) and commitments (1.46%) shall be temporarily increased by 0.6% to cover the liabilities resulting from the borrowing, but not for any other expenditure;
the Commission may, as a last resort, ask Member States to make an extra financial contribution if necessary to cover its EURI obligations.
The revenues from the own resources are used to finance all elements of EU expenditure in its annual budget and any surplus during one year is carried over to the following one.
Member States are responsible for making available the own resources and also for collecting customs duties on behalf of the EU. Member States keep 25% of the traditional income sources to cover their costs.
The decision repeals Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?
              
It will apply retroactively from 1 January 2021 as soon as it is ratified by all 27 Member States.
BACKGROUND
              
The decision needs to be approved/ratified by all 27 Member States to take effect. It is part of a wider financial package that includes:
the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 — Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093;
the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management (see summary) containing a roadmap for introducing new own resources;
the Recovery Instrument — Regulation (EU) 2020/2094.
KEY TERMS
              
Gross National Income: gross domestic product plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less production subsidies.
Payments: expenditure due in the current year from legal commitments made in that year or earlier.
Commitments: total cost of legal obligations (contracts, grants agreements/decisions) that may be signed in the current financial year.

Information on tyre fuel efficiency, braking capacity and noise levels
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/740 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to give consumers more information when choosing new tyres for their vehicles. It makes labels about a tyre’s characteristics and performance, in snow and ice for instance, more visible and informative. This will help end-users* take into account features such as safety, health protection and economic and environmental efficiency.
The legislation is designed to promote fuel-efficient, long-lasting and safe tyres with low noise levels.
It amends Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 (see summary).
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation:
applies to tyres for passenger cars (C1 tyres), buses and coaches, light and heavy goods vehicles, and light and heavy trailers (C2 and C3 tyres), as well as to retreads* once a suitable performance test is available;
does not apply to certain specalised categories of tyre, such as those for off-road professional use, to vehicles first registered before 1 October 1990 or to second-hand tyres, unless imported from a non-EU country.
Tyre suppliers must:
attach a sticker label to individual tyres and a printed label to a batch of tyres, containing the information set out in Annexes I and II, and provide a product information sheet containing the details specified in Annex III;
make the tyre label visible, preferably close to the price, in advertisements and distance selling or internet sales;
ensure the tyre labels and product information sheets are accurate;
cooperate with market surveillance authorities, which may carry out routine and ad hoc inspections, and act immediately if any infringements are discovered;
provide their national authorities, via a product database, with technical details of the tyres and their performance before they are offered for sale, enabling authorities to check the accuracy of the tyre labels — the information will have to be supplied from 1 May 2021 (and by 30 November 2021 for tyres produced between 25 June 2020 and 30 April 2021);
not provide or display labels, marks, symbols or inscriptions that do not comply with the regulation.
Tyre distributors must:
attach a sticker label to individual tyres and a printed label to a batch of tyres at the point of sale, containing the information required;
ensure the tyre label is displayed close to the price on any technical promotional material, paper-based distances sales, and advertisements and internet sales;
provide customers with a copy of the tyre label before a sale, if the tyres are not visible;
inform customers where they can access the product information sheet.
Suppliers and distributors of new vehicles must provide customers with the tyre label, product information sheet and any relevant technical promotional material before a purchase is made.
Internet service providers must ensure that suppliers selling tyres on their sites display the necessary label as well as the information sheet.
National authorities must:
allow the sale and use of tyres that comply with the legislation;
verify the accuracy of the information on the tyre labels;
lay down penalty and enforcement rules for any infringements.
The European Commission:
encourages and supports cooperation and information exchange between market surveillance authorities;
may adopt delegated acts to amend some of the annexes to take account of technical improvements;
submits a report evaluating the regulation to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee by 1 June 2025.

Internal market in electricity (from 2021)
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It outlines rules for the generation, transmission, distribution, supply and storage of electricity, together with consumer protection aspects, aiming to create integrated competitive, consumer-centred, flexible, fair and transparent electricity markets in the EU.
Among other things, it contains rules on retail markets for electricity, whereas Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which was adopted at the same time, mainly contains rules on the wholesale market and network operation.
It repeals Directive 2009/72/EC (see summary Internal market in electricity) as of 1 January 2021.
KEY POINTS
Customer rights
The directive clarifies and reinforces existing customer rights and introduces new ones:
right to freely choose a supplier and restrictions on switching and exit fees, except where fixed-price fixed-term contracts are terminated before their end date;
right to access to at least one price comparison tool fulfilling certain trust requirements; compliant privately run tools may be issued a trust mark;
right to join a citizen energy community while retaining full consumer rights, including the right to leave the community without penalties;
right to a dynamic price contract (based on prices in the spot or day-ahead market) from at least one supplier and every supplier with more than 200,000 customers, and right to be provided information about the opportunities and risks involved;
right to an aggregation contract independent of electricity supply;
right to produce, consume, store and sell electricity, individually or through an aggregator*;
right to request the installation of a smart meter within 4 months, while EU countries must ensure a roll-out of smart metering systems, except where it is not yet considered cost-effective;
right of energy-poor or vulnerable customers to targeted protection, but with regulated price-setting only allowed under certain conditions;
right of customers facing disconnection to be given information about alternatives, such as payment plans or a moratorium, well in advance.
Billing
Bills should be clear, correct, concise and presented in a way that makes comparisons easy.
Billing information should be provided at least every 6 months or once every 3 months, if requested, or, where the final customer has opted to receive electronic billing, and at least once a month if meters can be read remotely.
Aggregators
EU countries must:
ensure that aggregators can offer aggregation contracts to customers without those customers having to obtain the consent of their supplier;
ensure the fair participation of aggregators in all electricity markets and that transmission and distribution system operators treat aggregators equally with other market participants, including when they procure services;
establish transparent rules assigning roles and responsibilities to all market participants and set out rules for data exchange between market participants;
establish rules for compensation between aggregators and suppliers where the activation of demand response causes an imbalance; such compensation shall strictly cover resulting costs and the calculation of such compensation may take into account the systemic benefits of demand response.
Citizen energy communities
are shareholder- or member-controlled entities based on voluntary and open participation, which have the right to engage in generation, distribution, supply, consumption, energy efficiency services or charging services for electric vehicles, or provide other energy services to its members or shareholders;
have the right to be connected to distribution grids and be treated in a non-discriminatory manner in terms of regulation or access to all electricity markets;
have the right to share their own electricity production with their members in accordance with a cost-benefit analysis of distributed energy resources;
have the right, where so permitted by the EU country in question, to own, establish, purchase or lease distribution networks subject to the applicable regulations.
Access to data and interoperability
The directive updates rules on access to metering and consumption/generation data by network operators, consumers, suppliers and service providers. Moreover, it envisages that the European Commission will set up in secondary law interoperability rules to facilitate the exchange of data.
Data managers must ensure non-discriminatory access to data from smart metering systems while complying with the data protection rules.
Electromobility
EU countries must establish a regulatory framework to facilitate the connection of electric vehicle recharging points to the distribution network.
Distribution system operators* (DSOs) would only be allowed to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points if no other body has expressed interest in an open tendering procedure, subject to regulatory approval and in line with third-party access rules.
Distribution system operators (DSOs):
are responsible for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet demands for the distribution of electricity, including the cost-efficient integration of new electricity generation installations and especially the ones which produce electricity from renewable sources, as well as for providing system users with the information needed for efficient access and use of the system;
must publish network development plans setting out the planned investments for the following 5 to 10 years;
where part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision-making from other activities not relating to distribution;
are not allowed to own, develop, manage or operate storage facilities except where certain specific conditions are met.
Transmission system operators* (TSOs):
must ensure the long-term ability of the system to meet demands for the transmission of electricity, in close cooperation with neighbouring TSOs and DSOs.
shall manage the secure operation of the system including keeping the balance between electricity supply and demand.
are not allowed to own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities, under similar conditions as apply to DSOs.
National energy regulators:
must cooperate with neighbouring regulators and with the Agency for cooperation between EU energy regulators on issues including risk-preparedness, allocation of cross-border capacity and to ensure an adequate level of interconnector capacities.

Summary 81:
European Climate Law
European Climate Law
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The regulation:
establishes a framework for achieving climate neutrality within the European Union (EU) by 2050 (that is, a balance of EU-wide greenhouse-gas* emissions and their removal regulated in EU law);
includes, in addition to the binding objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, the aim of achieving negative emissions in the EU thereafter;
provides for a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030, and to set a climate target for 2040 within six months of the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement;
introduces rules to ensure continuous progress towards the global adaptation goal in the Paris Agreement (see summary).
KEY POINTS
              
EU institutions and EU Member States must take all necessary measures to meet the regulation’s aims, while taking fairness, solidarity and cost-effectiveness into account.
The regulation establishes an independent European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. The Management Board of the European Environment Agency designates the 15 members of the Advisory Board for a term of 4 years following an open selection procedure. They are selected on the basis of their scientific excellence, broad expertise and professional experience in the field of climate and environment science. The 15 senior scientific experts are appointed in a personal capacity.
The board’s tasks include:
considering the latest scientific findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and scientific climate data, in particular with regard to information relevant to the EU;
providing scientific advice and issuing reports on existing and proposed EU measures;
contributing to the exchange of independent scientific knowledge;
identifying action and opportunities to meet the EU’s targets;
raising awareness on climate change and its impact.
Member States must also:
set up a climate advisory body to provide expert scientific advice to the relevant national authorities;
establish a multilevel climate and energy dialogue involving local authorities, the civil society, the business community, investors, other relevant stakeholders and the public;
submit their 30-year strategy to the European Commission by 1 January 2029, and every 10 years after that, updating this every 5 years if necessary.
The regulation defines the following intermediate EU measures, which aim to help the EU meet its 2050 climate-neutrality objective.
Reducing net EU greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030; in July 2021, the Commission tabled a set of legislative proposals upgrading existing EU legislation and including new initiatives in the implementation of this new target. It will thereafter monitor the progress of the legislative proposals to determine whether the new target will be achieved.
Limiting the contribution of net removals to a maximum of 225 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent to ensure sufficient mitigation efforts are made leading up to 2030. With the aim of enhancing the EU’s carbon sink* in line with the 2050 climate-neutrality objective, the regulation also provides for the EU to aim for a higher volume of its net carbon sink in 2030.
Allowing for the Commission to propose a climate target for 2040 within 6 months of the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement. The proposal is to be accompanied by a report containing the projected indicative EU greenhouse-gas budget for 2030-2050.
Requiring the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council, within 6 months of each global stocktake under the Paris Agreement, on the progress the EU and Member States are making towards meeting the objectives of the regulation.
Adaptation to climate change requires:
EU institutions and Member States to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate changeensure adaptation policies are coherent, mutually supportive, provide benefits for sectoral policies, help integrate these measures into all policy areas and focus especially on the most vulnerable people and sectors;
the Commission to adopt an EU adaptation strategyguidelines, by 30 July 2022, setting out common principles and practices to identify, classify and manage climate risk when planning, developing, executing and monitoring projects and programmes;
Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans, taking into account particularly vulnerable sectors such as agriculture, water and food systems and food security, along with the need to promote nature- and ecosystem-based solutions.
Assessment of EU and national progress requires the Commission to:
assess by 30 September 2023, and every 5 years thereafter, the progress that the EU and the Member States have made towards the 2050 and adaptation objectives, and whether the EU and national measures towards those objectives are consistent;
evaluate whether draft EU measures and legislation, including budgetary proposals, are consistent with the 2030 and 2040 targets and the 2050 climate-neutrality objectives;
regularly assess relevant national measures and issue recommendations to a Member State where it finds inconsistencies in ensuring the climate-neutrality objective or inadequate progress made towards enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change.
The Commission engages with all:
parts of society, including the public, social partners and stakeholders, to enable and empower them to contribute towards a just, socially fair, climate-neutral and resilient society;
sectors of the economy that prepare indicative voluntary roadmaps towards climate neutrality.
The regulation amends:
Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 on the European Environment Agency and European Environment Information and Observation Network (see summary) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the governance of the Energy Union (see summary).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 29 July 2021.
BACKGROUND
In December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of a climate-neutral EU by 2050 in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
On 4 March 2020, the Commission adopted its proposal for a European Climate Law as an important element of the European Green Deal (see summary).
EU action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in a cost-effective way is already strongly developed. Between 1990 and 2019, emissions fell by 24%, while the economy grew by 60%. A major cornerstone of the EU’s climate policy is the emissions trading system set up by Directive 2003/87/EC (see summary).
For more information, see: European Climate Law (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Greenhouse gases: any gas capable of absorbing infrared radiation from the earth’s surface and reradiating it back to earth.
Sink: a reservoir that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/522 establishing a Programme for the EU’s action in the field of health (EU4Health Programme) for the period 2021-2027
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes the EU4Health programme which, like the European Union (EU)’s multiannual financial framework (MFF), runs from 2021 to 2027. It sets out the programme’s:
general and specific objectives;
forms and rules of EU funding.
KEY POINTS
              
The programme brings EU added value, creating efficiency gains and value-added impacts that could not be achieved by actions taken only at national level. It supports and complements national policies to promote and improve human health in Europe and ensures human health protection in all EU policies and activities in line with the One Health approach*.
The 4 general objectives are to:
improve and foster health in the EU;
protect people from serious cross-border health threats;
improve medicines, medical devices and crisis-relevant products;
strengthen health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency.
These are implemented through 10 specific objectives as follows:
to improve and foster health in the EU, the programme will support disease prevention and health promotioninternational health initiatives and cooperation;
to reinforce EU Member States and the EU’s abilities to tackle cross-border health threats, the programme will support prevention, preparedness and response to cross-border health threatscomplementing national stockpiling of essential crisis-relevant productssetting up a reserve of medical, healthcare and support staff;
to contribute to responding to the rising demand for healthcare and to fairer public health protection by supporting the improved availability, accessibility and affordability of medicinal products, medical devices and crisis-relevant products;
to improve the resilience and resource efficiency of health systems, EU4Health will support actions that contribute to strengthening health data, digital tools and services, and the digital transformation of healthcareenhancing access to healthcaredeveloping and implementing EU health legislation and evidence-based decision-makingintegrated work among Member States’ health systems.
Annex I to the regulation lists the many different activities eligible for EU funding under each of the 10 specific objectives. Recipients must acknowledge and ensure visibility of the EU finance they receive.
In cases of a serious cross-border threat to health or a public health emergency, procurement under the programme may take the following forms and the European Commission may:
jointly procure with Member States when they acquire, rent or lease fully the items procured;
carry on procurement on behalf of Member States on the basis of an agreement;
procure as a wholesaler buying, stocking and selling or donating supplies and services, for the benefit of the Member States and selected partner organisations.
The 7-year programme’s budget is €2,446,000,000 (current prices). This is increased by an additional €2,900,000,000 (2018 prices) from the MFF. The total €5.3 billion of funds are distributed according to the following criteria:
health promotion and disease prevention: minimum of 20%;
procurement to complement national stockpiling of essential crisis products: maximum of 12.5%;
global commitments and health initiatives: maximum of 12.5%;
administrative expenses: maximum of 8%.
The programme may provide funding in any of the forms laid down in the Financial Regulation, in particular in the form of grants, prizes and procurement. Grants should not exceed 60% of a project’s eligible costs, but this may rise to 80% where there is ‘exceptional utility’, as defined in Article 8. The grants may finance 100% of the eligible costs for actions of European Reference Networks (ERNs) or other transnational networks defined by EU law and, under certain conditions, for actions of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Non-EU countries may take part in the programme under certain conditions and only if they are associated with the programme.
Governance rules provide for a consultative EU4Health steering groupcomposed of Commission and national representatives. This:
ensures consistency and complementarity between national health policies, and between the programme and other EU measures;
follows the programme’s implementation, proposing any necessary adjustments;
meets at least 3 times a year so Member States can exchange views.
The Commission is assisted by a EU4Health Programme Committee, which gives an opinion prior the adoption of the annual work programme by the Commission. If the Committee has no opinion or a negative opinion, the Commission cannot adopt the work programme.
The Commission:
consults the steering group when preparing the annual work programmes and informs the European Parliament before the last meeting of the steering group on the outcome of those meetings;
seeks the views of relevant stakeholders, including civil society and patient organisations on the annual work programme’s priorities and strategic orientation as well as on the needs to be addressed and the achieved results;
implements EU4Health through annual work programmes, which it adopts after a positive opinion of the Member States in the Programme Committee;
will present an interim evaluation of the programme no later than 31 December 2024 and a final evaluation no later than the end of 2031 to the European Parliament, Council, European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions;
is assisted by an EU4Health Programme Committee;
implements information and communication campaigns about the programme;
has the power to adopt implementing and delegated acts.
Annex II sets out the 23 indicators used to evaluate the programme’s progress.
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 282/2014 from 1 January 2021 with transitional rules to cover the transition to EU4Health.

Regulation (EU) 2019/1838 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/124 as regards certain fishing opportunities in other waters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
              
The regulations set yearly total allowable catches (TACs)* and quotas* by fish stocks, as well as fishing effort levels in the different fishing areas in line with the objectives of the EU’s common fisheries policy — environmental and socioeconomic sustainability — to the benefit of the fish stocks, fishing sector and EU citizens.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulations apply to EU fishing vessels and non-EU vessels in EU waters and some recreational fisheries*.
Regulation (EU) 2020/123 sets 2020 catch limits for the main commercial fish stocks in the Atlantic, the North Sea and some other international fisheries in which EU vessels participate. The limits generally apply for the 2020 calendar year, but some extend into 2021 or apply for slightly different periods. The regulation includes rules on:
TACs and allocations among EU countries;
Conditions for landing catches and by-catches, including which species may be retained on board or landed, aiming to continue to reduce unwanted catches through the landing obligation (i.e. the prohibition to discard certain stocks at sea) for all stocks under catch limit;
Quota-exchange mechanism for TACs for unavoidable by-catches*;
Slightly increased by-catch levels for seabass in the Northern areas and additional flexibility in their management;
Measures on European eel fisheries in EU waters;
Special provisions on allocations of fishing opportunities to EU countries, such as exchanges and quota transfers;
Remedial measures for cod and whiting in the Celtic Sea, North Sea and Kattegat, with the aim of improving the selectivity of fishing gears and reducing by-catches;
Prohibited species;
Closed fishing seasons;
Recreational fisheries;
Sharks: retaining on board, transshipping* or landing is generally prohibited, and if caught accidentally must be promptly released.
The regulation also covers
Fishing authorisations in non-EU waters;
Fishing opportunities for non-EU vessels in EU waters.
Regulation (EU) 2019/2236 fixes for 2020 the fishing opportunities in the Mediterranean and Black Seas for the following fish stocks.The rules include:
A fishing effort regime in the Western Mediterranean applying to Spain, France and Italy;
A closure period for European eel in the entire Mediterranean Sea;
Catch and effort limits for small pelagic stocks and an effort limit for demersal stocks in the Adriatic Sea;
An autonomous quota for sprat in the Black Sea applying to Bulgaria and Romania;
A TAC for turbot in the Black Sea, as well as closure periods and a fishing effort regime.
Regulation (EU) 2019/1838 fixes fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks in the Baltic Sea for 2020 and amends some fishing opportunities in other waters fixed by Regulation (EU) 2019/124. It covers:
TACs and national quotas for the ten most commercially important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and how much European fishermen will be able to fish and under what conditions;
Decreased fishing opportunities for the majority of fish stocks;
Moderately increased TACs only for herring in the Gulf of Riga;
TACs maintained for salmon in the Gulf of Finland;
particularly significant cuts for cod, with a 60% decrease in the Western part of the Baltic Sea, and a TAC for by-catches only in the Eastern part;
Additional remedial measures on cod stocks, including stricter limits for recreational fisheries (normally a bag limit of five specimens per fisherman per day) and longer closure periods in some geographical subdivisions.
WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
              
They apply from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 with some minor exceptions.

Multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish
Multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1154 on a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules for the European Union (EU) implementation of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas’ (ICCAT) multiannual recovery plan for swordfish in the Mediterranean Sea.
The aim is to achieve a maximum sustainable yield* of Mediterranean swordfish by 2031, with at least a 60% probability of achieving that target.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation applies to:
EU vessels carrying out commercial or recreational fishing, which catch, transship* or carry on board Mediterranean swordfish, whether inside or outside the ICCAT Convention area;
non-EU vessels carrying out commercial or recreational Mediterranean swordfish fishing in EU watersinspected in EU Member State ports with Mediterranean swordfish or fishery products on board.
The recovery plan started in 2017 and continues until 2031.
Management measures
Member States must:
ensure that the fishing effort* of their vessels respects the fishing opportunities* they are given;
use transparent and objective criteria — notably environmental, social and economic criteria — when sharing out national quotas among their fleet and consider the needs of traditional and artisanal fishing;
provide for a maximum by-catch* of swordfish within their quota;
limit the number of vessels allowed to catch Mediterranean swordfish to the annual average number of vessels fishing between 2013 and 2016;
operate national scientific observer programmes for pelagic longline vessels and ensure that observers are deployed on at least 10% of vessels over 15 metres in length (Annex I sets out the terms and duties of the programmes).
Technical conservation
Fishing is not allowed between 1 January and 31 March each year. An additional closure period applies to longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore between 1 October and 30 November.
Mediterranean swordfish less than 100 cm in length and weighing under 11.4 kg may not be caught, landed, stored, sold or displayed.
Vessels may not use more than 2,500 hooks and longlines must not exceed 30 nautical miles (55.56 km).
Controls
Fishing vessels:
need Member State authorisation and must be included in the ICCAT register;
must transmit uninterrupted data from their vessel monitoring system — even when in port — to national monitoring centres, which forward this information at least every 2 hours to the European Commission, which in turn sends it to the ICCAT secretariat;
may not be chartered to catch Mediterranean swordfish;
must keep a fishing logbook (Annex II sets out the data to be recorded) and provide this data to their national authorities;
may only land or transship catches of Mediterranean swordfish and by-catches in designated ports (transshipment at sea is prohibited) and must give the ports prior notification of their arrival.
Member States must inform the Commission when 80% of a swordfish quota has been reached and thereafter report on catches on a weekly basis.
Inspections
Member States must:
establish and implement annual inspection plans, which the Commission will integrate into an EU inspection plan;
deploy an inspection and control vessel whenever more than 50 of their vessels are catching swordfish;
physically inspect, either in port or at sea, vessels that break the rules.
Joint international inspections are carried out according to the ICATT Scheme for Joint International Inspection (Annex III details how these operate).
The Commission may assign EU inspectors to accompany national inspectors.
Recreational fisheries
Member States must:
establish a recreational fisheries quota within their national quota;
prohibit swordfish caught during recreational fishing from being sold or marketed;
allow only rod and line vessels to participate in recreational fishing;
require details of the vessels involved, their owners and catch data, including the weight of each swordfish caught.
Member States must also submit a wide range of information — annual reports, fishing plans, details of authorised vessels, inspections made and data collected by scientific observers — to the Commission, which will forward much of it to the ICCAT secretariat.
The Commission:
may adopt implementing and delegated acts;
reports to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the recovery plan’s performance by 31 December 2025.
The regulation makes small amendments to:
Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 on the management, conservation and control measures applicable in the ICCAT convention area by deleting articles 20 to 26;
Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 on the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea (see summary) by reducing the number of hooks per vessels from 3,500 to 2,500.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 15 July 2019.
BACKGROUND
The International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (see summary) provides for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas — and establishes ICCAT. The EU has been a contracting party to the ICCAT Convention since 14 November 1997.
The EU accounts for some 70% of the total catches of Mediterranean swordfish. Greece, Spain and Italy catch the most, with a further 10% shared between France, Croatia, Cyprus and Malta. Other countries, notably Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey, also exploit the stock.
The regulation essentially implements the multiannual recovery plan adopted by ICCAT in 2016. However, it introduces some stronger control and monitoring requirements.
KEY TERMS
              
Maximum sustainable yield: the maximum catch that can be taken from a stock without damaging its long-term health.
Transship: transferring a catch from a vessel to another vessel.
Fishing effort: a measure of the amount of fishing through inputs such as days at sea, length of nets and number of hooks.
Fishing opportunities: a quantified legal entitlement to fish expressed by catches or fishing effort.
By-catch: unwanted fish and marine species caught unintentionally.

Multiannual EU budget (2014-2020)
Multiannual EU budget (2014-2020)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 — the EU’s multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
		
It sets out the maximum annual amounts that can be spent on the EU’s different policy areas over the 2014-2020 period.
KEY POINTS
		
The EU adopted the 7-year plan for the 2014-2020 period in December 2013. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) amounts to €960 billion in commitments (legal promise to provide finance, assuming certain conditions are met) and €908.4 billion in payments (actual transfers to beneficiaries) over the 7-year period, expressed in constant prices of the year 2011.The MFF regulation lays down ceilings (maximum amounts) for each category of EU spending over the period. These must be respected when agreeing the EU’s annual budgets.The 2014-2020 MFF is broken down into headings, as follows.
Heading 1 - Smart and inclusive growth: €450.763 billion (of which €325.149 billion for economic, social and territorial cohesion).
Heading 2 - Sustainable growth: natural resources: €373.179 billion.
Heading 3 - Security and citizenship: €15.686 billion.
Heading 4 - Global Europe: €58.704 billion.
Heading 5 - Administration: €61.629 billion.
A central focus of the 2014-2020 MFF is on growth and employment. Subheading 1a on ‘competitiveness’ has increased by over 37% compared with the previous 2007-2013 MFF, reflecting the importance of this political priority. However, the new MFF is smaller than its predecessor, given that many EU countries face budgetary pressures on the home front.
The MFF regulation also provides for special instruments that allow the EU to react to specified, unforeseen circumstances. It can also allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure that cannot be financed within the limits of the ceilings that are available for one or more headings, notably:
the Emergency Aid Reserve (used to finance, for example, humanitarian aid and civilian crisis management);
the 
European Union Solidarity Fund;
the Flexibility Instrument;
the 
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund;
the Contingency Margin (a last-resort instrument to react to unforeseen circumstances).
An interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters and sound financial management was also agreed between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission. This should rationalise the annual budgetary procedure and complement the MFF regulation.
Reallocation of 2014 unused commitments
The MFF regulation provides that in the event of the adoption of programmes under shared management for the Structural and Investment Funds, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund after 1 January 2014, the MFF should be revised to reallocate the amounts not used in 2014 to subsequent years.As a result, the MFF regulation has been revised so as to allow the transfer of 2014’s unused commitments: €16.5 billion to 2015, €4.5 billion to 2016 and €0.1 billion to 2017. This was due to the late adoption of 300 out of the 645 EU programmes in areas covered by the abovementioned EU funds.The revision of the EU’s MFF keeps the total expenditure ceilings unchanged and involves no additional money.
Review
The MFF had to be reviewed no later than in 2016 to allow the European Parliament (elected in 2014), the Council and the Commission (appointed in 2014) to reassess the priorities for the remaining years of the framework. This assessment was undertaken in light of the economic situation at the time as well as of the latest macroeconomic projections.
Following the mid-term reviewRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 was amended by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2017/1123 in 2017. The revised MFF increases the resources earmarked for the EU’s main priorities by €6.01 billion for the years 2017-2020, as follows:
€2.08 billion for boosting growth and creating jobs through programmes such as the youth employment initiative (+ €1.2 billion), Horizon 2020 (+ €200 million), and Erasmus+ (+ €100 million);
€2.55 billion for addressing migration, enhancing security and strengthening external border control;
€1.39 billion for tackling the root causes of migration.
Each year, ahead of the budgetary procedure for the following year, the Commission makes a technical adjustment to the MFF in line with movements in the EU’s gross national income and prices. The results of this adjustment for 2018 were first communicated to the European Parliament and the Council in May 2017. However, these results were subsequently revised to take into account the 2017 amendment to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 and were communicated to the European Parliament and the Council in September 2017.

It sets out the fund’s priorities, its budget and the specific rules for providing EU funding, complementary to the general rules applying to the EMFAF under Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (see summary).
KEY POINTS
Priorities
The EMFAF supports the EU’s common fisheries policy, the EU maritime policy and the EU agenda for international ocean governance. This helps to fulfil the objectives of the European Green Deal and contributes to the protection of marine biodiversity, to the EU’s climate change mitigation objectives and to food supply.
The EMFAF supports innovative projects that contribute to the sustainable use and management of aquatic and maritime resources. In particular, it facilitates:
sustainable and low-carbon fishing activities;
the protection of marine biodiversity and ecosystems;
the supply of quality and healthy seafood to European consumers through an efficient market for fisheries products;
the socioeconomic attractiveness and generational renewal of the fisheries sector, in particular as regards small-scale coastal fisheries;
the structural management of fisheries and fishing fleets (eliminating fleet overcapacity and supporting measures for the conservation of marine biological resources);
the collection of scientific data to underpin fisheries management;
the control of fishing activities and the promotion of a culture of compliance in the fishing sector, to ensure a level playing field;
the development of sustainable and competitive aquaculture, contributing to food security;
the improvement of skills and working conditions in fisheries and aquaculture;
the economic and social vitality of coastal communities;
innovation in the sustainable blue economy;
maritime security, contributing to a safe maritime space;
international cooperation, contributing to healthy, safe and sustainably managed oceans.
In pursuing these objectives, the EMFAF has a specific focus on the sustainability and profitability of small-scale coastal fishing and on the sustainable development of maritime activities in the outermost regions.
Budget
For 2021–2027, the EMFAF budget is €6,108,000,000 (at 2021 prices), divided as follows:
shared management — €5,311,000,000 provided through national programmes co-financed by the EU budget and the EU Member States;
direct and indirect management — €797,000,000 provided by the European Commission.
Annex V lists the global resources from the EMFAF per Member State for each of the years from 2021 to 2027. For operations in the outermost regions, the Member States concerned must allocate from these global amounts at least:
€102,000,000 for the Azores and Madeira (Portugal);
€82,000,000 for the Canary Islands (Spain);
€131,000,000 for French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Réunion and Saint Martin (France).
Programming
Under shared management, each Member State prepares a single national programme, which the Commission approves after an in-depth assessment.
A national EMFAF programme is a strategic roadmap for public investment between 2021 and 2027. It describes tailor-made actions to respond to the specific challenges identified by the Member States as regards the common EU priorities for marine biodiversity, maritime policy and sustainable fisheries and aquaculture.
Evaluation and monitoring
The EMFAF’s implementation is continuously monitored in a transparent manner, in accordance with the common rules set in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and the specific rules in the EMFAF regulation.
Twice each year, Member States report: on the values of the indicators selected in their EMFAF programmes — this information is aggregated at EU level and made publicly available;on the detailed characteristics of each project and beneficiary — the Commission uses this information for regular ad hoc reporting.
Five times each year, Member States report on the number of selected projects and on their financial cost. This information is aggregated at EU level and made publicly available. It is also broken down according to thematic areas.
The Commission discusses the EMFAF’s implementation with each Member State in an annual review meeting. This meeting aims to identify potential issues in the national EMFAF programme and corrective actions, if necessary.
By 30 June 2029, each Member State will evaluate its EMFAF programme to assess its impact.
By the end of 2024 and also by the end of 2031, the Commission will evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value of the EMFAF as a whole.

Management, conservation and control measures in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention area
Management, conservation and control measures in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention area
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2021/56 laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention area and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The regulation transposes into EU law the management, conservation and control measures adopted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) concerning stocks of tunas, and other species of fish in the same ecosystem.
The Convention covers a defined area of the eastern Pacific Ocean.
KEY POINTS
Conservation and management
Time closures: fishing is closed to purse seine* vessels for tropical tunas (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and skipjack tuna) for 2 periods each year. Each EU Member State involved in the fishery stipulates by 15 June which of the two closure periods — from 29 July to 8 October, or from 9 November to 19 January — will apply to their vessels.
Area closures: fishing for tropical tunas within the area of 96° and 110°W and between 4°N and 3°S is closed from 9 October to 8 November.
Deploying fishing gear within 1 nautical mile of, or interacting with, an anchored data buoy* in the Convention area is prohibited.
Active fish-aggregating devices* (FADs) are limited to 450 per purse seine vessel. Member Statesshall report daily information on all active FADs to the European Commission submitted with a time delay of at least 60 days, but with not more than 90 days between each report. Operators of EU fishing vessels must collect and report any interaction with FADs.
All transhipments of IATTC species in the Convention area shall take place in port.
Protecting marine species
The following species shall not be retained on board, transhipped, landed, stored, or sold, and must be safely released: oceanic whitetip sharks;mobulid rays (which includes Manta rays and Mobula rays);silky sharks (where caught by purse seine).
EU fishing vessels shall not set a purse seine net on a school of tunas where a whale shark is present, and incidents should be reported. They shall promptly release sharks (whether alive or dead) as soon as possible without compromising human safety.
EU longline fishing vessels shall not use shark lines.
Catch data for silky and hammerhead sharks shall be reported to the IATTC.
Sea turtles shall be promptly released, in a way that causes the least harm and without compromising human safety of any persons. At least one crew member must be trained in techniques for handling and release of sea turtles to improve survival after release.
There are also measures aimed at protecting seabirds (restrictions on using longlines), and dolphins (authorised vessels only, and restrictions on using purse seines when fishing for yellowfin tunas).
Scientific observers on long-liners
Member States must ensure that longline vessels carry a scientific observer on board, to cover at least 5% of the fishing effort made by vessels longer than 20 metres, who records catches of targeted fish species, species composition and any other available biological information as well as any interactions with non-target species such as sea turtles, seabirds and sharks. The regulation includes detailed rules to assure observer safety.
Vessel requirements
Member States shall provide detailed information on each fishing vessel under their jurisdiction fishing in the Convention area for the IATTC Regional Vessel Register.
A well (as space on board a vessel to carry live fish) that is sealed must be physically sealed in a tamper-proof manner so that it is not connected with any other space on the vessel and cannot be used for any other storage. Observers must report to the IATTC any instances of sealed wells being used for storing fish.
Catch data
Catch data must be reported by Member States to the Commission annually for species covered by the Convention, with special rules for reporting on bigeye tuna caught by purse seiners and bait boats.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 15 February 2021.
BACKGROUND
              
The EU concluded the Convention in 2006 as a contracting party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (see summary).
See also:
Regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Purse seine: any encircling net, the bottom of which is drawn together by a purse line at the bottom of the net, which passes through a series of rings along the ground rope, enabling the net to be pursed and closed.
Data buoys: floating devices, either drifting or anchored, that are deployed by governmental or recognised scientific organisations or entities to electronically collect environmental data, not in support of fishing activities, and which have been notified to the IATTC Secretariat.
Fish-aggregating device (FAD): anchored, drifting, floating or submerged objects deployed or tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio or satellite buoys, for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purse seine fishing operations.

Summary 92:
Better Law-Making — Agreement between EU institutions
Better Law-Making — Agreement between EU institutions
SUMMARY OF:
Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS AGREEMENT?
It aims to improve the way the EU makes laws by ensuring that the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission (‘the 3 Institutions’) are committed to sincere and transparent cooperation throughout the entire legislative cycle.
The agreement replaces the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2003 without prejudice to the Framework Agreement on relations between the Parliament and the Commission of 20 October 2010.
KEY POINTS
Annual and multiannual programming
At the beginning of each legislature, the 3 Institutions will agree on multiannual priorities. In addition, they will each year adopt a joint declaration on annual interinstitutional priorities based on the Commission’s annual work programme. The first such Joint Declaration was adopted for 2017.
Impact assessments
The agreement establishes that the Commission should carry out impact assessments for all its major legislative and non-legislative proposals. The elements that should be covered by impact assessments include:
economic, environmental and social impacts;
subsidiarity and proportionality;
impacts on competitiveness and SMEs in particular;
digital aspects;
territorial impacts.
The Commission will rely on a Regulatory Scrutiny Board, partly made up of external experts, to carry out an objective quality check of the Commission’s impact assessment.
The Parliament and the Council may carry out impact assessments on their substantial amendments when they consider this appropriate and necessary. In addition, the agreement sets rules for public and stakeholder consultations and ex post evaluation of EU legislation.
TransparencyThe Agreement stresses the importance of enhancing the transparency of legislative procedures, including:
agreeing improved practical arrangements between the 3 Institutions for cooperation and information-sharing on international agreements;
an appropriate handling of trilogues*;
joint public announcements of the successful outcome of the legislative process;
a joint database on legislative files allowing clear traceability of the various steps of the legislative process.
Delegated and implementing acts
The Agreement sets rules to clarify and facilitate the use of delegated and implementing acts in accordance with Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and contains an annex with standard clauses to this effect. In particular, it was agreed that:
the Commission will consult EU countries’ experts in the preparation of delegated acts, and Parliament and Council experts will have equal access to all related meetings and documents;
there will be a prompt alignment of all pre-Lisbon Treaty files;
a further negotiation will take place to specify non-binding delineation criteria for delegated and implementing acts (i.e. non-binding criteria for the application of Articles 290 and 291 TFEU); and
a public register for delegated acts will be set up (the Interinstitutional Register of Delegated Acts ‘DelReg’ has been in operation since the end of 2017).
Implementing and applying EU lawThe agreement includes 3 innovations to help improve and clarify the implementation and application of EU law:
1.EU countries must clearly inform the public of measures taken in EU countries that incorporate EU law into national law or implement EU law, in line with the Joint Declarations of 2011 regarding explanatory documents which accompany the notification of such measures;
2.EU countries are asked to clearly identify in the transposing act (i.e. the act that incorporates the EU legislation into national law) or associated document when they add aspects to their national law which are in no way related to what the EU act contains (‘gold plating’);
3.the Commission should include any instances of gold plating in its annual report to the Parliament and the Council.
SimplificationThe Agreement requires the 3 institutions to cooperate to simplify legislation and reduce burdens whilst ensuring that the objectives of the legislation are met. The 3 Institutions confirm:
their commitment to using the technique of recasting to modify existing legislation more frequently and, where recasting is not appropriate, codifying legislative texts as soon as possible after the adoption of an amending act;
their will to promote the most efficient regulatory instruments, such as harmonisation and mutual recognition, to avoid over-regulation and reduce administrative burdens.
The Commission presents an annual burden survey of the results of the EU’s efforts to simplify legislation and reduce administrative burdens, making use of its Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT).
Implementation of the Agreement
Paragraph 50 of the Agreement envisages that the 3 Institutions regularly take stock of its implementation via the Interinstitutional Coordination Group and that they meet annually at political level to evaluate progress.
FROM WHEN DOES THE AGREEMENT APPLY?
              
It has applied since 13 April 2016.

Summary 93:
The citizens’ initiative
The citizens’ initiative
European Union citizens have the right of initiative under which they may invite the European Commission to propose a legal act in any field within its competence. It is the first example of transnational participatory democracy.
ACT
                  
Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens’ initiative.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
                     
The Regulation establishes the rules and procedures governing the citizens’ initiative.
KEY POINTS
                     
To ensure that support is sufficiently broad, a citizens’ initiative must be supported by 1 million citizens from at least a quarter of EU countries, which currently means seven countries. There is also a requirement for a minimum number of signatories from each of these countries, roughly proportionate to their respective populations (degressive proportionality).
Organising a citizens’ initiative
To launch an initiative, citizens must form a ‘citizens' committee’ comprising at least seven members residing in at least seven EU countries. All must be old enough to vote in European Parliament elections. The initiative must be registered on the European Commission's website. If the registration criteria set out in the regulation are fulfilled, the registration is confirmed by the Commission and the organisers have 1 year to collect signatures (statements of support).
Signing a citizens’ initiative
The same voting age requirement applies to those signing the statements of support. These statements can be completed either on paper or online if organisers have set up an online collection system.
One million signatures. What’s next?
The Commission has 3 months to examine the initiative. During this time, the Commission meets with the organisers who also have the opportunity to present the initiative at a public hearing in the European Parliament. The Commission presents a formal response explaining what it intends to do and the reasons for that decision. It is not obliged to propose legislation.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
                     
This regulation applies from 1 April 2012.
Further information is available from the European Commission’s European Citizens’ Initiative website.

Summary 95:
Pesticide safety on the EU market
Pesticide safety on the EU market
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 – the placing of plant protection products on the EU market
SUMMARY
            
The EU attaches great importance to protecting human and animal health and the environment. Standardising rules on the sale of plant protection products helps to achieve this, ensures the smooth working of the single market and improves agricultural production.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
              
It lays down rules for authorising the sale, use and control of plant protection products in the EU. It recognises the precautionary principle which EU countries may apply if there is scientific uncertainty about the risks a plant protection product might pose to human or animal health or the environment.
KEY POINTS
              
—
              The legislation applies to products used to protect or preserve plants, influence their growth or destroy and stunt undesired plants.
            
—
              To secure approval, an active substance (any chemical, plant extract or micro-organism that acts against pests or on plants) must not have any harmful effects on human health, including vulnerable groups, or any unacceptable effect on the environment.
            
—
              Plant protection products must be effective, have no immediate or delayed harmful effect on human health, no unacceptable effects on plants or the environment and not cause unnecessary suffering or pain to vertebrates.
            
—
              The competent national authority in each EU country may attach criteria and restrictions such as minimum degree of purity, type of preparation and manner and conditions of use, when approving a pesticide*.
            
—
              The authority gives its first approval for a period not exceeding 10 years. Approval of a renewal request may be for no more than 15 years.
            
—
              Applications for approval of an active substance, accompanied by the necessary scientific information, must be submitted to national authorities. They have a maximum of 12 months to examine the request.
            
—
              Holders of an authorisation in one EU country may use the mutual recognition procedure to request its use in another.
KEY TERM
*Pesticide: something that prevents, destroys or controls a harmful organism (pest) or disease, or protects plants or plant products during production, storage and transport. Pesticide is a broader term than plant protection product since it covers non-plant/crop uses like biocides.
BACKGROUND

Summary 96:
The EU’s Internal Market Information System (IMI)
The EU’s Internal Market Information System (IMI)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It lays down rules on the use of the Internal Market Information (IMI) system for administrative cooperation between EU countries’ competent authorities in Single Market related policy areas.
KEY POINTS
The IMI system is a secure Internet application that allows national, regional and local authorities to communicate quickly and easily with their counterparts in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway about EU internal market law (i.e. the laws relating to the single market that exists between the EU countries and in which the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons is assured, and where citizens are free to live, work, study and do business).
It helps these authorities to overcome practical difficulties related in particular to differences in administrative culture, the use of different languages and the identification of partners in other EU countries.
It is a free public service, developed by the Commission available in all EU languages and running since 2008.
Major benefits for the publicBy speeding up procedures and improving the communication between public authorities, IMI reduces costs caused by delays and enables authorities to provide a better service to individuals and businesses. As such, IMI is a tool that indirectly helps individuals and businesses to make the most of the opportunities offered by the EU's internal market.
Areas where the IMI is used
Two examples of directives for which the IMI is used are Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications and Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.
Under professional qualifications, the IMI system can be used by an EU country to check the validity of qualifications for professionals wanting to practise in that country.
In addition to professional qualifications and services, the following are examples of other areas covered by the IMI: posting of workers: IMI supports the cooperation under the Posting of Workers and the Enforcement directives allowing EU countries to exchange information in the field of labour mobility,Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network: IMI supports 11 administrative procedures under the new CPC Regulation, helping consumer protection authorities and other stakeholders to cooperate in an efficient and user-friendly way (see summary),cross-border healthcare,Solvit (to which individuals and businesses can submit complaints about national authorities).
Thanks to its flexibility, the system can easily be expanded to new areas.
A list of areas in which IMI is used is available online.
Main functions
IMI offers the following main functions:
bilateral information exchanges (one-to-one workflow) secure exchanges of information between two competent authorities;
multilateral information exchanges (one-to-many workflows) allowing authorities to send out information to multiple recipients;
repositories searchable multilingual databases to share information among IMI actors;
SOLVIT case handling workflow to support the resolution of complaints from citizens and businesses concerning the application of EU law by public authorities;
a public interface, allowing external actors to interact with IMI.
Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012
Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 has been amended to enable IMI to be used in the context of:
processing applications for a European professional card (Directive 2013/55/EU amending Directive 2005/36/EC — see summary);
the posting of workers providing services (Directive 2014/67/EU — see summary);
the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of an EU country (Directive 2014/60/EU — see summary);
the requirements for presenting certain public documents (Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 — see summary);
EU type-approvals for non-road mobile machinery (Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 — see summary);
the single digital gateway which allows online access to procedures and assistance for individuals and businesses (Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 — see summary); and
the posting of drivers in the road transport sector (Directive (EU) 2020/1057).
Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 amends the annex to Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012, adding Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on operating rules for road haulage and passenger transport companies (see summary) to the list of EU acts implemented by means of IMI.
Implementing acts
The Commission has adopted the following implementing acts:
Implementing Decision 2014/89/EU on a pilot project concerning train driving licences (implementing Directive 2007/59/EC — see summary)
Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/743 on a pilot project to implement the administrative cooperation rules relating to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of personal data — see summary;

Summary 98:
Single EU patent boosts intellectual property protection and cuts related costs
Single EU patent boosts intellectual property protection and cuts related costs
Under the new EU Patent (unitary patent protection), inventors may submit a single application to protect their invention in 25 Member States. The scheme also makes access to patent protection easier, less costly and legally secure.
ACT
1257/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2012 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection.
SUMMARY
The EU Regulation 1257/2012 on unitary patent protection (UPP) extends the European patent system, enabling an invention to be protected in all of the 25 participating Member States with just one application. The new patent could reduce patent translation and related costs by up to 80%, with a single annual renewal fee to the European Patent Office (EPO).
Patents to date in Europe have either been granted nationally or by the EPO. However, if a European patent is to be effective in a Member State, the patent holder must request validation in each country where patent protection is sought. Translation and annual renewal fees for these patents can be costly and are an overall burden for the EU.
As outlined in this regulation, the EU Patent aims to end the complexity and expense of the current European patent system. For example:
Holders of European patents can apply for the EU Patent for the territory of 25 Member States at the EPO. This patent will offer the same level of protection for their inventions in all those countries.
Patent applications can be submitted to the EPO in any language. However applicants will also have to provide a translation in one of the EPO's three official languages (English, French or German). Applicants can claim compensation if they are EU-based businesses, individuals, non-profit organisations, universities and public research bodies. The patent claims defining the scope of protection must be translated into the other two official languages of the EPO.
Lastly, for a transitional period of no more than 12 years, European patents with a unitary effect that were granted in French or German will need to be translated to English; those granted in English will need to be translated to another official language of the EU. These translations will be required until high-quality machine translations into all EU languages become available.
Enhanced cooperation
Both this regulation and EU Regulation 1260/2012 on translation arrangements for UPP were adopted by 25 Member States under the enhanced cooperation* procedure. Non-participating Member States can join later.
Unified Patent Court
The patent reform package includes an Agreement on a Unified Patent Court. Established under an international agreement signed on 19 February 2013, this court will have specialised jurisdiction in patent disputes, thus avoiding costly multiple litigation in up to 28 different national courts.
* This allows EU Member States willing to work towards a common goal to do so outside of traditional Union collaboration, in this case through an intergovernmental treaty.

Intellectual property rights infringements
Intellectual property rights infringements
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 386/2012 on the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It entrusts the EU Intellectual Property Office, EUIPO (formerly the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, OHIM), with tasks supporting the activities of national authorities, the private sector and EU institutions in the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights (IPR) covered by Directive 2004/48/EC.
KEY POINTS
              
EUIPO is responsible for bringing together experts, authorities and stakeholders under the umbrella of the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights (the observatory), although its tasks do not extend to participation in individual operations or investigations carried out by the competent authorities.
It has the following tasks:
improving understanding of the value of intellectual property;
improving understanding of the scope and impact of IPR infringements;
enhancing knowledge of best public and private sector practices to protect IPR;
helping to raise citizens’ awareness of the impact of IPR infringements;
enhancing the expertise of persons involved in IPR enforcement;
enhancing knowledge of technical tools to prevent and tackle IPR infringements, including tracking and tracing systems which help to distinguish genuine products from counterfeit ones;
providing mechanisms which help to improve the online exchange, between EU countries working on IPR, of information relating to enforcement, and fostering cooperation;
working, in consultation with EU countries, to foster international cooperation with IPR bodies in non-EU countries to build strategies and develop techniques, skills and tools for IPR enforcement.
Observatory meetings
At least once a year, EUIPO will host meetings of representatives from public administrations and organisations from EU countries dealing with IPR and a broad, representative and balanced range of private-sector representatives most concerned by or most experienced in the fight against IPR infringements (rights holders, including authors and other creators) as well as internet intermediaries. Consumer organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises, authors and other creators must be properly represented.
Representatives of the European Parliament and from the European Commission are invited to participate or observe, as appropriate.
Private-sector representatives meeting as part of the observatory are expected to keep EUIPO informed of their IPR-enforcement policies and strategies and to provide statistical data on infringements in their field of activity.
Work programme
EUIPO will draw up an annual work programme prioritising the observatory’s activities set out in the regulation and for the observatory meetings, in line with the EU's IPR policies and priorities and in cooperation with representatives from the observatory.
Management report
The annual management report contains at least the following information concerning EUIPO’s tasks and activities under this regulation:
a review of the main activities carried out during the year;
the results achieved during the year, accompanied by reports analysing the situation in the different industry and product sectors;
an overall assessment of the fulfilment of EUIPO’s tasks;
an overview of future activities;
observations on the enforcement of IPR and potential future policies and strategies, including how to enhance effective cooperation with and between EU countries;
an overall assessment of representation in the observatory.
Evaluation
A report will evaluate the regulation’s application with particular regard to its impact on IPR enforcement in the EU’s single market.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It applies from 5 June 2012.

Summary 100:
EU rights to apply and enforce international trade rules
EU rights to apply and enforce international trade rules
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 654/2014 — the EU’s rights to apply and enforce international trade rules — amending Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 laying down procedures to ensure the EU’s rights under international trade rules
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It ensures that the EU is able to enforce and exercise its rights under international trade agreements by adopting trade policy measures.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation sets out rules and procedures for the EU to suspend or withdraw its obligations under an international trade agreement in order to:
respond to breaches of international trade rules by non-EU countries and enforce a judicial ruling in favour of the EU, to obtain a satisfactory solution that restores benefits for EU businesses;
rebalance obligations under and in line with a trade agreement, when non-EU countries alter the treatment of goods from the EU, either temporarily through a safeguard measure or long-term through modifying tariff concessions.
Action
To safeguard the EU’s interests, the European Commission can adopt implementing acts to adapt its trade policy in response to the actions of the non-EU country concerned. In urgent cases, the Commission can immediately adopt applicable implementing acts. The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, consults with relevant stakeholders before adopting these acts.
Available trade policy measures
These consist of:
suspending tariff concessions and imposing new or increased customs duties;
introducing or increasing quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports or exports of goods;
suspending concessions and introducing certain restrictions in the area of public procurement.
Determining appropriate measures
Trade policy measures are determined based on the following:
effectiveness of the measures in inducing the non-EU country to comply with international trade rules;
potential of the measures to provide relief to businesses within the EU affected by non-EU country measures;
availability of alternative sources of supply for the goods or services concerned;
avoiding disproportionate administrative complexity and costs in applying the measures;
measures must be proportionate to and must not exceed the harm that they are introduced to counteract.
Revision of the regulation
Because a current lack of new appointments to the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has meant that the second tier of its dispute settlement mechanism is not able to function, amending Regulation (EU) 2021/167 introduced some changes to Regulation (EU) No 654/2014.
The amending Regulation (EU) 2021/167:
allows enforcement action in situations where: the EU obtains a favourable ruling from a WTO dispute settlement panel,the process is then blocked because the non-EU country appeals to the non-functioning WTO Appellate Body, and does not agree to interim appeal arbitration under Article 25 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding;
allows enforcement action when: a trade partner under a bilateral or regional trade agreement imposes illegal trade measures,subsequently does not take the steps necessary for the dispute settlement process under that agreement to function;
extends the scope of possible countermeasures to trade in services and some trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. This extension is accompanied by safeguards to ensure that the most efficient and proportionate countermeasures are used and that EU Member States’ authorities and stakeholders are consulted.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) No 654/2014 has applied since 17 July 2014.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2021/167 has applied since 13 February 2021.

Summary 102:
The European Account Preservation Order for debt recovery between EU countries
The European Account Preservation Order for debt recovery between EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 655/2014 — European Account Preservation Order
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to facilitate debt recovery between EU countries in civil and commercial matters.
It establishes a new procedure allowing a court in one EU country to freeze funds in the bank account of a debtor in another EU country.
KEY POINTS
              
A European procedure is established whereby a creditor is able to obtain a European Account Preservation Order (EAPO) that blocks funds held by the debtor in a bank account or accounts in another EU country(ies).
Scope
The EAPO is available to citizens and businesses:
in cases between EU countries, i.e. when the account, at the date of application for an EAPO, is held in an EU country other than where the creditor is domiciled or the court seized is based;
as an alternative to national procedures, but does not replace them.
It applies to financial claims in civil and commercial matters, excluding the following matters:
revenue, customs or administrative matters and social security;
rights in property arising out of marriage or equivalent relationship, and wills and succession;
claims against a debtor who is the object of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, judicial arrangements, compositions or other similar proceedings.
Some categories of specially protected bank accounts are also excluded.
The EAPO is not available for creditors or bank accounts based in Denmark or the United Kingdom (1).
Procedure for obtaining an EAPO
The procedure is open before initiating proceedings on the substance of the matter against the debtor, during the proceedings or after obtaining a judgment, court settlement or authentic instrument requiring the debtor to pay.
The court competent to issue an EAPO is normally one that is competent to rule on the substance of the matter. Where the debtor is a consumer, the court competent to issue an EAPO to secure a claim relating to the consumer’s contract is the court of the EU country where the debtor is domiciled.
In all cases, the creditor must provide evidence to convince the court that there is a real risk that justifies the need to freeze the debtor’s account. If the creditor requests an EAPO before obtaining a judgment on the substance of the matter, sufficient evidence should also be given to the likely success of the substance of the claim.
A specific form is to be used in order to apply for an EAPO, together with all supporting documents.
Short time limits are set by which the different steps in the procedure must be completed; these vary depending on whether the creditor has already obtained a judgment or not.
The creditor has the right to appeal against a refusal to issue an EAPO.
In order to ensure the surprise effect and the usefulness of the EAPO, the debtor is not informed prior to its implementation.
The creditor who does not know the debtor’s account information can, under certain conditions, request the court to obtain account information from designated authorities in the EU country of enforcement.
Recognition, enforceability and enforcement of the EAPO
An EAPO issued in an EU country in accordance with the regulation should be recognised and enforceable in another EU country without any special procedure or declaration of enforceability.
There is an obligation on the bank to declare, by means of a specific form, whether the EAPO has led to the preservation of any of the debtor’s funds.
The creditor has a duty to request the release of any funds preserved that exceed the amount specified in the EAPO.
Some amounts may be exempt from seizure under the law of the country of enforcement, i.e. amounts necessary to ensure the livelihood of the debtor and of their family.
Safeguards for the debtor
In order to counterbalance the absence of a prior hearing, there are the following safeguards for the debtor against the abusive use of the EAPO:
remedies — including a right of appeal — to be able to challenge the EAPO as soon as the debtor is informed of the blocking of their accounts; and
rules on the provision of a security by the creditor — to ensure that the debtor can be compensated for any damage caused by the EAPO:
rules on the creditor’s liability for any damage caused to the debtor by the EAPO due to an error on the creditor’s behalf.
Forms
There are nine dedicated EAPO forms in total. Their content is set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1823.
General rules
The regulation also addresses various related matters, including legal representation, court fees, costs supported by the banks, fees charged by authorities, data protection and language of documents.
The regulation does not affect the application of a number of related acts, such as Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 (on the service of documents) and Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 (on the taking of evidence).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
The regulation has applied since 18 January 2017 with the exception of its Article 50, which has applied since 18 July 2016. Article 50 relates to the information to be supplied by EU countries, such as the courts that they designate to issue (Article 6(4)) and the authorities to enforce EAPOs.
BACKGROUND
              
The regulation follows a Green Paper on improving the efficiency of enforcing judgments in the EU. In it, the European Commission described how the fragmentation of national rules on enforcement negatively affected debt collection within the EU, and observed that in practice a creditor seeking to recover a monetary claim in Europe will most commonly try to do so by taking enforcement actions against the debtor’s bank account, and that such procedures exist in most EU countries.

Controlling the EU external maritime borders and saving immigrants’ lives in operations at sea
Controlling the EU external maritime borders and saving immigrants’ lives in operations at sea
This regulation sets out the rules for the monitoring of the European Union’s sea borders, the interception of vessels suspected of carrying irregular immigrants and the rescue of those in danger at sea in border surveillance operations under the coordination of Frontex.
ACT
Regulation (EU) No 656/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union.
SUMMARY
                  
The objective of the European Union's external maritime borders policy is to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing external borders so as to counter irregular immigration and cross-border crime, while protecting and saving lives at sea.
To this end, sea operations under the supervision of Frontex (the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union) are envisaged to:
detect unauthorised attempts to cross external borders;
intercept vessels suspected of trying to enter the European Union without submitting to border checks and carrying irregular immigrants;
address situations such as search and rescue that may arise during a border surveillance operation at sea;
guarantee the protection of immigrants’ fundamental rights and prevent their expulsion to a country where they might be subject to persecution or danger of death (the principle of non-refoulement).
INTERCEPTION OF VESSELS
                     
Specific rules are set out in case of detection of vessels with irregular immigrants on board depending on where the vessels are intercepted (in territorial sea, contiguous zones or high seas). EU countries are able to seize the vessel, apprehend the persons on board and lead the vessel to a coastal country, the host EU country or to a non EU- country provided that this does not put them in danger.
Other rules are set out to manage search and rescue situations to offer assistance to persons in distress at sea and disembark the people who are rescued.
During an operation at sea, assistance must be provided regardless of the nationality or status of the persons to be assisted and in accordance with the relevant international law.
FRONTEX OPERATIONAL PLAN
                     
Border surveillance operations are carried out by EU countries with the operational support of Frontex. The agency is responsible for:
coordinating operational cooperation between EU countries;
providing increased technical and operational assistance in case of humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea.
To this end, an operational plan is prepared containing details adapted to the circumstances of the planned operation at sea. In particular, operational plans must ensure that children and vulnerable persons are provided with appropriate assistance.
Solidarity mechanisms
EU countries subject to strong migratory pressure may request specific help and support from the European Asylum Support Office and the deployment of European Border Guard Teams, in case of an emergency situation.

FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
EU home affairs policies have been steadily growing in importance in recent years. Their aim is to help create a more open and secure Europe. They seek to achieve this by efficiently managing migration flows and preventing crime while enabling legitimate travel and ensuring the management of the EU’s external borders.
In late 2013, the EU agreed on a multiannual financial framework (the EU’s long-term budget) for the period from 2014 to 2020. In parallel, the structure of the EU’s spending instruments has been rationalised, resulting in two home affairs funds: an Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and an Internal Security Fund (which in turn comprises two funding instruments — ISF-Borders and ISF-Police).

Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF)
Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 on establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
This regulation establishes the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. This fund aims to contribute to the efficient management of migration flows and improve the implementation and development of the common policy on immigration and asylum of the European Union (EU).
The EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) has 4 main objectives:
strengthening and developing all aspects of the Common European Asylum System, including its external dimension;
supporting legal migration to the EU Member States in accordance with their economic and social needs, such as labour market needs, and promoting the effective integration of nationals from non-EU countries;
enhancing return strategies in the Member States, with an emphasis on the sustainability of return and effective readmission in the countries of origin;
enhancing solidarity and the sharing of responsibility between the Member States, in particular for those most affected by migration and asylum flows.
KEY POINTS
              
All Member States (except Denmark, which is not participating in this fund) prepare national programmes outlining the actions through which they intend to achieve the objectives set out in the AMIF regulation.
Examples of actions include measures to support:
reception and asylum systems (such as improved administrative structures, training of staff dealing with asylum procedures and developing alternatives to detention);
integration measures, with a focus on the local level (such as the provision of training and services to non-EU nationals and the sharing of best practices among EU Member States);
voluntary return programmes, reintegration measures, etc.
While most of the fund’s budget is allocated to the national programmes, part of it is used for EU-level actions (‘Union actions’), emergency assistance, the European Migration Network and technical assistance at the initiative of the European Commission.
Specific actions
In addition to their national programme allocation, Member States may receive an additional amount for the implementation of specific actions. These actions (listed in Annex II), require Member States to cooperate with each other and generate significant added value for the EU.
Union resettlement programme
Each Member State may also receive, every 2 years, an additional amount based on a lump sum of €6,000 for each resettled person, which will be increased to €10,000 for common priorities (such as regional protection programmes) and vulnerable groups of persons.
Budget
The financial envelope for the implementation of the fund for 2014-2020 was initially set at €3.137 billion, which has been more than doubled over the financial period 2014-2020, mainly due to the migration crisis in 2015-2016.
Details regarding the implementation of the fund are to be found in Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 (see summary).

A safer EU: police cooperation, and crisis management
Regulation (EU) No 513/2014 sets out the rules for a European Union financing instrument which, as part of the Internal Security Fund (ISF), concerns police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management.
ACT
Regulation (EU) No 513/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management and repealing Council Decision 2007/125/JHA.
SUMMARY
Known as the ISF-Police regulation, the instrument aims to contribute to a high level of security in the EU. To reach this objective, it will support actions related to crime prevention; combating cross-border, serious and organised crime, including terrorism; and strengthening cooperation between law enforcement authorities and other authorities in EU countries, with Europol and other EU bodies, and with relevant non-EU countries and international organisations.
It will also support actions to enhance the capacity of EU countries and the EU for managing security-related risks and crises effectively, and preparing for and protecting people and critical infrastructure (e.g. electricity, water, transport) against terrorist attacks and other security-related incidents.
Operational objectives
1.
Strengthen EU countries’ capability to prevent and combat cross-border crime.
2.
Promote cooperation among EU countries’ law enforcement authorities (police, customs, etc.) and between EU countries and Europol.
3.
Develop training schemes, including technical and professional skills and knowledge of obligations relating to respect of human rights.
4.
Develop measures, safeguards, mechanisms and best practices for early identification, protection and support of witnesses and victims of crime.
5.
Develop measures to strengthen EU countries’ administrative and operational capability to protect critical infrastructure.
6.
Enable the rapid production of comprehensive and accurate overviews in crisis situations, coordinate response measures and share secret or sensitive information.
7.
Develop integrated approaches based on common and shared appreciations in crisis situations and enhance mutual understanding of EU countries’ and partner countries’ various definitions of threat levels.
Examples of eligible actions include:
—
actions to improve police cooperation, including joint investigation teams;
—
communication activities;
—
maintenance of EU and national IT systems, notably on cybersecurity and cybercrime;
—

Conserving fish stocks in countries with unsustainable fishing
Conserving fish stocks in countries with unsustainable fishing
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 — measures for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It sets up a system allowing the EU to adopt measures in regard to the activities and policies of certain non-EU countries which allow non-sustainable fishing.
These measures are designed to help the conservation of fish stocks of common interest* both to the EU and the non-EU countries in question.
KEY POINTS
              
A country is identified as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing where:
it fails to cooperate in the management of a stock of common interest in full compliance with the rules agreed in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and in the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, or any other international agreement or norm of international law; and
either: it fails to adopt necessary fishery management measures; orit adopts fishery management measures without due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other countries and the EU which, when cumulated with the measures taken by other countries and the EU, lead to fishing which could result in unsustainable stocks.
Measures the EU can take
Examples of the measures that the European Commission can take in respect of a country allowing non-sustainable fishing include:
quotas on imports of fish from the stock of common interest that have been caught under the control of that country and on imports of fishery products containing such fish;
restrictions on the use of EU ports by vessels flying the flag of that country which fish or which transport fish or fish products derived from the stock of common interest and/or associated species,flying another flag that are authorised by that country;
bans on the purchase by EU fishing companies of a fishing vessel flying the flag of that country;
bans on the reflagging of fishing vessels flying the flag of an EU country to the flag of that country;
bans on the export to that country of fishing vessels flying the flag of an EU country or of fishing equipment and supplies needed to fish on the stock of common interest;
bans on making private trade arrangements between EU fishing operators and that country that enable a fishing vessel flying the flag of an EU country to use fishing opportunities of that country;
prohibiting joint fishing operations involving EU fishing vessels and fishing vessels flying the flag of that country.
All measures taken must be:
related to the conservation of the stock of common interest;
made effective in conjunction with restrictions on fishing by EU vessels, or on production or consumption within the EU, of fish and products containing fish of the species for which the measures have been adopted;
proportionate to the objectives pursued and compatible with the obligations imposed by international agreements to which the EU is a party and any other relevant norms of international law.
Prior to adopting measures, the Commission must notify the country concerned of the intention to identify it as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing. In such cases, it must immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 17 November 2012.
KEY TERMS
              
Stock of common interest: a fish stock whose geographical distribution makes it available to both EU and non-EU countries and the management of which requires the cooperation between such countries and the EU, in either bilateral or multilateral settings.

Bilateral investment agreements — EU and non-EU countries
Bilateral investment agreements — EU and non-EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 1219/2012 establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between EU countries and non-EU countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It aims to ensure a smooth transition from the current system of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) between EU countries and non-EU countries to a system under which BITs are negotiated by the European Commission.
This transition is required following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes foreign direct investment as an EU competence as part of the EU’s common commercial policy.
KEY POINTS
What are bilateral investment treaties?
They establish the terms and conditions for private investment by nationals and companies of one country in another one.
BITs between an EU country and a non-EU country:
BITs signed before 1 December 2009 can, upon authorisation by the Commission, be: maintained in force or enter into force under the conditions of the regulation until a BIT between the EU and a non-EU country comes into force,amended (including to address an inconsistency between the BIT and EU law) or a new agreement can be concluded subject to the conditions set out in the regulation;
BITs signed between 1 December 2009 and 9 January 2013 are maintained in force or enter into force if, in the view of the Commission, they do not conflict with other EU law, are not inconsistent with the EU’s principles and are not deemed superfluous in view of Commission negotiations with that non-EU country;
if the conditions of the regulation are fulfilled, the Commission may authorise an EU country to enter into negotiation with a non-EU country concerning a new BIT or to sign and conclude a new BIT if the negotiation result is in line with the requirements of the regulation.
Oversight
The Commission has been given implementing powers to ensure that the regulation is implemented uniformly and is assisted by the Committee for Investment Agreements.
The Commission has to present a report on the application of this regulation by 10 January 2020.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 9 January 2013.

Preferential European Union import tariffs for developing countries
Preferential European Union import tariffs for developing countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
In 2012, the European Union (EU) agreed on new rules to refocus this scheme, which has been in place since 1971. These rules make the system more transparent and predictable for beneficiary countries, especially in view of the changed global trade patterns over the past decade. The scheme is now directed at those countries in greatest need.
The regulation does not include countries that already enjoy preferences under free trade agreements with the EU, or under autonomous arrangements with the EU (usually temporary, pending the conclusion of more comprehensive, longer-term agreements with the EU).
KEY POINTS
              
The EU’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) allows developing countries to pay lower tariffs on their exports to the EU. This helps boost their economies.
Three strands of the scheme
Standard GSP. Tariffs for goods imported from a developing country are reduced or suspended. Exception: this does not apply if a country has been classified by the World Bank as a high or upper-middle income country for 3 consecutive years immediately before the EU updates the list of beneficiary countries.
GSP+ (incentive scheme). Even lower tariffs for countries that ratify and implement 27 specified international conventions covering human and labour rights, environment and good governance.
Everything but arms for least-developed countries. Full tariff and quota-free imports for all goods from the United Nations-defined least developed countries, except for arms.
Suspension of countries
The EU may temporarily suspend the lower tariffs for reasons such as:
violations of core principles in human and labour rights conventions;
unfair trading practices;
serious shortcomings in customs controls (e.g. export or transit of illegal drugs);
the national law of a GSP+ beneficiary country no longer incorporates the relevant conventions (or that law not being effectively implemented).
Discontinuation as countries develop
Some countries can be poor but still develop highly competitive export industries. Once this happens, they no longer need preferences to successfully penetrate EU markets.
The GSP scheme therefore withdraws preferences from countries with such competitive product sectors on the basis of a graduation mechanism.
More stable and predictable
The new GSP offers importers and exporters more stability and predictability, because it now lasts 10 years (as opposed to 3 years in the past).
Exporters know that – where changes are made in the beneficiary list – there are transition periods of at least 1 year. Countries now have the security of knowing that they can be removed from the beneficiary lists only if the United Nations lists them as high or upper-middle income countries 3 years in a row.
Temporary import restrictions
The EU may apply safeguard measures (temporary restrictions) if imports from beneficiary countries cause or threaten to cause serious difficulty to an EU producer. It may also apply surveillance measures for farm products. None of these measures have ever been taken in the history of the scheme.
List of beneficiary countries
Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 is being amended through implementing and delegated acts so as to update the list of the countries benefiting from tariff preferences under the GSP+. See latest consolidated version.

Firearms — combating illicit manufacture and trafficking
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 258/2012: implementing the United Nations’ Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
It lays down rules on exporting, importing and transporting firearms, their parts and components, and ammunition.
It therefore implements Article 10 (which deals with imports, exports and transit of firearms) of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition.
KEY POINTS
Annex I to this regulation contains a list of the firearms, their parts and ammunition that require export authorisation. The European Commission has the power to amend this list.
The relevant authority of the EU country where a prospective exporter is based may grant export authorisation upon receiving an export authorisation form from that exporter.
When exporting firearms, their parts and ammunition outside the EU, an exporter must provide the relevant authority in its own EU country with authorisation from the non-EU country receiving the shipment, and from any non-EU countries through which the shipment will pass. The authority must then process the export authorisation application within 60 days.
For traceability purposes, export and import authorisations and their accompanying documentation must contain information including, for example:
the place and date of issue,
the expiry date,
both the country of export and import,
transit countries,
the final recipient, and
a description of and quantity of the firearms, their parts and ammunition.
Simplified procedures exist for firearms, their parts and ammunition used for hunting and sports shooting.
When deciding whether to grant an export authorisation, EU countries must take into account considerations such as:
international treaties and
national foreign and security policy.
EU countries also need to take account of considerations covered by Council Common Position 2008/994/CFSP which defines EU rules on the control of exports of military technology and equipment. These include aspects such as:
risk that the intended recipient would use the military technology or equipment to be exported aggressively against another country or to assert by force a territorial claim, or
risk that the military technology or equipment would be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions.
EU countries must refuse to grant export authorisation if the applicant has a criminal record. In addition, they must annul, suspend, modify or revoke the authorisation if the conditions are no longer met.
The regulation does not apply to antique or deactivated firearms, or to firearms intended for military or police use.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 30 September 2013.
BACKGROUND
              
The UN’s Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition is the only legally binding instrument on small arms at global level. It establishes a set of rules for countries to control and regulate illicit firearms and arms trafficking, prevent their diversion into crime, and facilitate the investigation and prosecution of related offences without hampering legitimate trade.
The Protocol supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.

European border surveillance system (Eurosur)
European border surveillance system (Eurosur)
To improve integrated border management and to prevent cross-border crime and illegal immigration, the European Union (EU) created the European border surveillance system (Eurosur).
ACT
                  
Regulation (EU) No 1052/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 establishing the European border surveillance system (Eurosur).
SUMMARY
                  
In October 2013, the EU adopted a regulation establishing the European border surveillance system (Eurosur).
Multi-purpose system
Eurosur is a multi-purpose system to prevent illegal immigration and cross-border crime at the external borders. It will also contribute to ensuring the protection and saving the lives of migrants trying to reach European shores.
It provides a mechanism allowing border surveillance agencies to rapidly exchange information and work together. By means of national coordination centres, all EU countries’ national authorities responsible for border surveillance (e.g. border guards, police, coastguard, navy, etc.) must coordinate their activities with those of other EU countries and the EU border agency, Frontex.
Faster responses thanks to better information
Eurosur follows an intelligence-driven approach, allowing national and EU agencies to better understand what is happening at external borders and to respond faster to new routes and methods used by criminal networks.
Rapid reaction capability
Eurosur enables EU countries to react faster not only to single incidents, but also to critical situations occurring at EU external borders. For this purpose, the external land and sea borders have been divided into ‘border sections’ and they have each been assigned a low, medium or high ‘impact level’. This allows hotspots at the external borders to be identified, with a standardised reaction at national level and at EU level, if required.
Fundamental rights
EU countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement and Frontex must fully respect fundamental rights, in particular the non-refoulement principle (which forbids a true victim of persecution being returned to their persecutor) and personal data protection.
Entry into force
As of December 2013, Eurosur was operational in the 19 EU countries that signed the Schengen Agreement that have southern and eastern external borders. The remaining 11 Schengen countries joined Eurosur on 1 December 2014.
Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (1) did not take part in the adoption of this regulation. However, it was agreed that Ireland and the United Kingdom (1) could cooperate with Eurosur by means of regional networks. Denmark has since decided to participate in Eurosur.

WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It expands Eurodac, which is an EU-wide biometric database containing fingerprints of asylum applicants and non-EU/European Economic Area (EEA) nationals for comparison between EU countries.
The aim is to: make it easier for EU countries to determine responsibility for examining an asylum application by comparing the fingerprints of asylum applicants and non-EU/EEA nationals against a central database; andenable law-enforcement authorities, subject to strict conditions, to consult Eurodac for the investigation, detection and prevention of terrorist or serious criminal offences.

Each EU country must take the fingerprints of all asylum applicants and those apprehended while trying to cross a border irregularly (e.g. non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons entering without valid documents) over the age of 14 and, within 72 hours, transmit the data to Eurodac.
When an asylum applicant or non-EU/EEA national has been found to be present illegally in an EU country, then that EU country can consult Eurodac to determine whether the individual has previously applied for asylum in an EU country or has previously been apprehended when trying to unlawfully enter the EU.
Fingerprint data should be erased once asylum applicants, non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons obtain citizenship of an EU country.
This regulation helps apply the Dublin III Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 604/2013), which lays down rules for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application.
The original Eurodac legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) did not offer a means for law enforcement authorities to request data comparisons. This regulation, however, allows police forces and Europol to compare fingerprints linked to criminal investigations with those contained in Eurodac. However, due to the fundamental right to privacy, law-enforcement agencies are only allowed to use Eurodac for comparisons: where there are reasonable grounds that doing so will substantially assist them in preventing, detecting or investigating a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence; andonly as a last resort after several other checks have been carried out first.
No Eurodac data may be shared with non-EU countries (other than Iceland and Norway).
Some asylum applicants and non-EU/EEA nationals or stateless persons have refused to cooperate with EU countries’ attempts to fingerprint them for the Eurodac database. This led the European Commission to issue a document on possible best practice relating to fingerprinting.
The Protocol between the EU, Iceland and Norway, signed in 2020, extends the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Norway and Iceland.

Enhancing quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs
Enhancing quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It seeks to enhance Europe’s quality policy for agricultural products by increasing the coherence of various quality schemes.
It includes measures to support agricultural and processing activities, along with the farming systems associated with high-quality products, in line with EU rural development policy objectives. The regulation, does not, however, apply to spirit drinks, aromatised wines or grapevine products.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation’s main features are:
it groups in a single regulation rules for registering products as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG);
it lays down a single set of rules for PDO, PGI and TSG as regards procedures and the role of producers;
it strengthens and simplifies the PDO, PGI and TSG schemes;
it reinforces and clarifies the level of protection of registered names and the common EU symbols;
it shortens and simplifies the procedure to register names (PDO, PGI and TSG);
it requires EU products registered and marketed as PDO, PGI or TSG in line with this regulation to have labels showing the European Union symbol and the name of the product (since 4 January 2016);
it introduces a new framework to develop optional quality terms, providing consumers with extra information. This includes the new term mountain product.
Amending legislation
In 2017, Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (see summary).
The amended text requires that verification of compliance with product specifications before placing products on the market be carried out by:
the competent authorities designated in accordance with amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (Article 4); or
delegated bodies (as defined in Article 3(5) of amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625).
Delegated bodies performing controls in non-EU countries must be accredited to the relevant harmonised standard for ‘conformity assessment — requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services’. These bodies may be accredited either by a national accreditation body outside the EU, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 (see summary), or by an accreditation body outside the EU that is a signatory of a multilateral recognition arrangement under the auspices of the International Accreditation Forum.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 has applied since 3 January 2013, although Article 12(3) and Article 23(3) have applied since 4 January 2016, without prejudice to products already placed on the market before that date.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 has applied since 14 December 2019.

Maritime safety: accelerated phasing-in of double-hull oil tankers
Maritime safety: accelerated phasing-in of double-hull oil tankers
To reduce the risk of accidental oil pollution in European waters, this law forbids the transport of heavy grades of oil to or from European Union (EU) ports in single-hull oil tankers. It also ensures an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements single-hull oil tankers no later than 2015.
ACT
Regulation (EU) No 530/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers.
SUMMARY
The latest EU law on the phasing-in of double-hull oil tankers, adopted in 2012, retains the essence of its previous law of 2002. It merges all the amendments made to the previous law into one text to make it clearer and thus more user-friendly.
The law applies to oil tankers of 5 000 tonnes deadweight and above which fly the flag of an EU member country, or, irrespective of their flag, which enter or leave a port or offshore terminal or anchor in an area under the jurisdiction of an EU country.
It does not, however, apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship, owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.
The regulation:
prohibits the transport to or from EU ports of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers;
lays down an accelerated phasing-in scheme for the application of the double-hull or equivalent design requirements of the International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (also known as MARPOL) to single-hull oil tankers, with 2015 as the final deadline.
Background
In 2002, following a series of accidents involving oil tankers which resulted in serious pollution, the EU adopted a law requiring the phase-out of the more vulnerable single-hull oil tankers (where oil in the cargo tanks is separated from the seawater only by a bottom and a side plate) and their replacement by double-hull vessels (where the cargo tanks are surrounded by a second internal plate at a sufficient distance from the external plate).

European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)
European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 establishing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets up EIOPA, a European Union (EU) body that supports coordination between national authorities and ensures the consistent application of EU laws for the insurance and occupational pensions sectors in EU Member States.
Its aim is to promote financial stability and the public’s trust in the insurance and pensions markets.
It seeks to protect the rights of policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries.
KEY POINTS
Consistent application of law
EIOPA draws up regulatory and technical standards that accompany laws adopted by the Council and the European Parliament for: insurance and reinsurance companies;financial conglomerates (large financial companies active in various financial sectors);occupational pensions;insurance intermediaries (businesses selling pensions and insurance policies).
It also has the power to issue guidelines and recommendations on the application of relevant EU law.
Market trends
To ensure the stability of insurance markets and to protect policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries, EIOPA carries out a range of tasks. These include monitoring consumer trends and assessing potential market risks and vulnerabilities.
Under certain strict conditions, EIOPA can temporarily prohibit or restrict financial activities that cause a threat to the financial system’s stability or have the potential to cause significant financial damage to customers or consumers.
Breaches of law
EIOPA has the power to investigate a breach of law by a national authority, when a national authority fails to ensure that a financial institution complies with EU law.
Within 2 months, EIOPA can issue a recommendation to the national authority. The European Commission may then issue a formal opinion requiring the authority to take the necessary action to comply with the law. If the national authority still does not comply, EIOPA may directly address a decision to a financial institution under certain strict conditions. This decision prevails over previous decisions taken by the national authority on the same matter.
Supervisory convergence
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2175 enhanced the scope of EIOPA’s role and responsibilities. It ensures that EIOPA:
is able to assist national supervisors in the use and authorisation of internal models — used by insurance companies to calculate requirements on solvency capital — thus helping to achieve more convergent outcomes across the Member States;
can promote convergent supervisory practices within the EU’s internal market and assist competent authorities to protect insurance policyholders in cross-border disputes with the introduction of collaboration platforms — to be set up whenever competent authorities see the need for coordination in the light of specific market developments — and improved information exchange between the different supervisors of insurance firms operating cross-border;
with the other ESAs, assesses the work of the national supervisors (peer reviews) and publishes reports to encourage compliance and increase transparency;
in the event of money laundering or terrorist financing by financial sector operators or competent authorities within its remit, gives its prior agreement where a decision is to be taken by the European Banking Authority (which has overarching powers in this field with respect to all the European supervisory authorities).
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 has applied since 1 January 2011 (apart from its Article 76 on preparatory actions and Article 77(1) and (2) on transitional staff provisions which apply from 16 December 2010).

Free movement of workers
Free movement of workers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 on the right of EU workers to move within the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It updates (and codifies) earlier legislation on the ability of European Union citizens to move freely and to work in another EU country.
It also seeks to ensure that the principle of free movement enshrined in Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is respected in practice.
KEY POINTS
The free movement of labour benefits the individuals who choose to work elsewhere in the EU as well as the societies which receive them. It enables the former to exercise their right to free movement and to improve their personal and professional situation, and the latter to fill job vacancies and skills shortages.
Just as someone living in one EU country has the right to take up gainful employment in another, so can employers advertise job vacancies and agree contracts with potential employees from throughout the EU.
The legislation codifies and replaces Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, which was substantially amended several times. It ensures the system operates smoothly by outlawing any form of nationality discrimination between EU workers.
In particular, it bans: separate recruitment procedures for foreign nationals; andlimits on advertising vacancies or the imposition of specific conditions such as registering with employment offices for people coming from another EU country.
Similarly, it is illegal to discriminate between national and other EU workers on employment and work terms, covering: access to employment, including the jobseekers’ assistance by employment offices;working conditions, including pay, dismissal, reinstatement or re-employment;access to training, including in vocational schools and retraining centres.
The same principle of access to educational, apprenticeship and vocational training schemes applies to the children of someone who is or has been working in another EU country.
The legislation covers certain social rights. A worker working in another EU country is entitled to the same social and tax advantages as nationals of the host EU country. He also has the right to housing benefits in the same conditions as nationals and may register on a housing list, where these exist, in the area where they are working.
The legislation also covers equality of treatment as regards membership of trade unions and the exercise of related rights, such as the right to vote and to be eligible for administrative or management posts in a trade union.
A certain level of language knowledge may be required for a job, but any language requirement must be reasonable and necessary for the job in question.
The legislation sets up an Advisory Committee comprising 6 members from each EU country: 2 representing the government, 2 the trade unions and 2 the employers’ associations. This committee assists the European Commission in matters concerning free movement of workers. The European Labour Authority, established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1149 participates in the committee’s meetings as an observer, providing technical input and expertise.
One exceptionThe one exception to the non-discrimination principle concerns access to posts involving the exercise of public authority and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the state. EU countries may reserve such posts for their own nationals.
EURES regulation
In 2016, Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2016/589 on the European Employment Services (EURES). As a result, the rules on the exchange of information on job vacancies, job applications and CVs across EU countries now fall within the scope of the new regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 16 June 2011. Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 codified and replaced Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and its subsequent amendments.

Substances depleting the ozone layer
Substances depleting the ozone layer
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (Ozone Regulation)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down rules on the production, import, export, sale, use, recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of substances that damage the ozone layer.
It sets out reporting requirements and measures for products and equipment that use these substances.
It has been slightly amended four times.
KEY POINTS
As a general rule, the production and sale of controlled substances, such as halons (to extinguish fires), methyl bromide (to control pests) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (used in fridges and air conditioning systems), whose manufacture or use is regulated, are prohibited.
Some exemptions, under clear conditions, are allowed, for example if they are used as feedstock*, as process agents* or for laboratory or analytical use.
Use of methyl bromide has been banned since March 2010, except during emergency quarantines to prevent the spread of disease or pests. In each case, the Commission must give its temporary authorisation.
Fire protection systems and fire extinguishers containing halons may be used in certain circumstances. Alternatives are increasingly available and amending Regulation (EU) No 744/2010 sets out detailed cut-off dates. These range from 2013 to 2040 depending on the halon use.
Imports and exports of controlled substances and products containing them are essentially banned. Where they are allowed, a licence system operates. In 2013, the Commission made this more flexible for halons used in aircraft.
Recovery systems must be in place to destroy, recycle or reclaim controlled substances used in refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pump equipment, fire extinguishers and protection systems and items containing solvents.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2010.

Better environmental performance: European eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)
Better environmental performance: European eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes the eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), which is a voluntary premium environmental management tool for all kinds of organisations that are willing to evaluate, report on and improve their environmental performance.
KEY POINTS
The EMAS registration process
To receive EMAS registration, an organisation must:
conduct a review of all the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services;
adopt an environmental policy containing a commitment to comply with all the relevant legislation and to achieve continuous improvement of their environmental performance;
develop a programme with information on specific environmental objectives and targets;
establish an effective management system to achieve its environmental policy and ensure continuous improvement;
carry out an environmental audit assessing the management system in place and overall conformity with its policy and programme;
provide an environmental statement of its performance, set against its objectives, and the steps to be taken in the future.
Validation
The environmental review, management system, audit procedure and statement must be approved by an accredited environmental verifier.The validated statement is registered and made publicly available.
Use of the EMAS logo
An organisation successfully completing all these stages may use the EMAS logo on its letterheads and in reference to its activities and services, to demonstrate its commitment to improving its environmental performance.
European Commission decisions
The European Commission has adopted a series of decisions in relation to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009. They include:
Decision 2011/832/EU concerning a guide on European Union (EU) corporate registration, non-EU-country and global registration under Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009;
Decision (EU) 2016/1621 on a guidance document on notification to accreditation and licensing bodies by environmental verifiers active in an EU Member State other than that where the accreditation or licence was granted under Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009;
Decisions (EU) 2017/2285 and (EU) 2020/1802 amending the user’s guide setting out the steps needed to participate in EMAS.
The Commission has also adopted a further series of decisions on sectoral reference documents – concerning best environmental management practices, sector environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence for:
the retail trade sector (Decision (EU) 2015/801);
the tourism sector (Decision (EU) 2016/611);
the food and beverage manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2017/1508);
the agriculture sector (Decision (EU) 2018/813);
the electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2019/63);
the car manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2019/62);
the public administration sector (Decision (EU) 2019/61);
the waste management sector (Decision (EU) 2020/519);
the fabricated metal products manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2021/2053);
the telecommunications and information and communication technologies services sector (Decision (EU) 2021/2054).
Amendments to the legislation
Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 has been amended three times:
Regulation (EU) No 517/2013 amended the regulation, adapting it to take account of Croatia becoming a member of the EU in July 2013.
Regulation (EU) 2017/1505 amends Annexes I, II and III to take into account the requirements set out in the new version of the International Standard ISO 14001. Because organisations wishing to obtain or maintain both EMAS registration and ISO 14001 certification often conduct one integrated verification/certification process, coherence between the requirements of these two instruments should be kept.
Regulation (EU) 2018/2026 amends Annex IV to address improvements identified in the light of experience gained in the operation of EMAS. Given the number and nature of these amendments, in the interests of clarity it was considered appropriate to replace Annex IV in its entirety.
Repeal
Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 repeals Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC.

Summary 120:
Geographical origin of spirit drinks
Geographical origin of spirit drinks
In order to protect consumers and develop the spirit drinks* sector, the European Union has created a legal framework that ensures uniform EU-wide rules on the marketing of spirit drinks.
ACT
                  
Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
                     
It sets the rules regarding the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, and also the protection of geographical indications. It applies to all spirit drinks, whether produced in EU or non-EU countries.
KEY POINTS
Annex II of this regulation highlights 46 different categories for spirit drinks with different qualities the spirit drink must have in order to be included in any given category. If the spirit drink contains qualities from several categories, then it may be sold under one or more of the category denominations.
The general rules concerning the presentation and the labelling of foodstuffs apply to spirit drinks. However, specific labelling and presentation rules are laid down in this regulation, such as labelling the raw materials used, drawing the parameters of the term ‘blend’, indicating the maturation period, banning lead-based capsules from being used as closing devices and ensuring that labelling is given in one or more of the EU's official languages.
The geographical indication identifies a spirit drink as originating within the territory of a country where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic is attributable to its geographical origin.
In order to register a geographical indication, both EU countries and non-EU countries must submit an application to the European Commission. The application must include a technical file containing information such as the description of the spirit drink, the definition of the geographical area, a description of the method for obtaining the spirit drink, any requirements laid down by European, national or regional provisions, and the name and contact address of the applicant.
If the spirit drink no longer possesses the characteristics described in the technical file, the European Commission may cancel the registration of a geographical indication.
KEY TERMS
* Spirit drinks: alcoholic drinks intended for human consumption. By definition, they possess particular organoleptic qualities and have a minimum alcoholic strength of 15 %. They are produced by distillation, by maceration or by the addition of flavourings, or by mixing a spirit drink with another drink, ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin or certain distillates.

Summary 121:
Civil aviation security: EU-wide rules
Civil aviation security: EU-wide rules
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down common rules and basic standards on aviation security and on procedures to monitor their implementation.
It applies to all civil airports in the EU, as well as to air carriers and other persons or businesses providing goods or services to or through these airports.
It replaces Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 which was adopted in the wake of the 11 September 2001 events and which established common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
KEY POINTS
Common basic standards for protecting civil aviation
These standards include, for example:
screening of passengers and cabin baggage to stop prohibited articles, such as weapons and explosives, being carried on board aircraft;
the hold luggage (luggage that passengers check in) is also screened before loading;
airport security (e.g. controlled access to different areas of airports, staff screening and checking of vehicles, as well as surveillance and patrols to prevent unauthorised people from entering these areas);
protection of aircraft and aircraft security checks or searches before departure to ensure that no prohibited articles are on board;
security controls for cargo and mail before being loaded on to aircraft;
security controls for airport supplies (i.e. supplies intended to be sold in duty-free shops and restaurants) and in-flight supplies (e.g. food and drink for passengers);
staff recruitment and training;
security equipment performance (i.e. equipment used for screening and access controls complies with defined specifications and is capable of performing the security controls concerned).
In November 2015, the European Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998. It lays down detailed measures for the implementation of these security standards and repealed a previous regulation (Regulation (EU) No 185/2010) which had been amended more than 20 times. Since its adoption, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 has itself been amended several times.
The amendments modify the list of non-EU countries recognised as applying equivalent standards to those of the EU, and introduce new rules regarding:
airport security;
aircraft security;
screening of liquids, aerosols and gels, hold baggage, cargo and mail, in-flight supplies;
staff recruitment and training;
security equipment;
background checks to enhance security culture and resilience;
performance standards;
the use of shoe explosive detection equipment and explosive vapour detection equipment.
Obligations on EU countries and on airports and operators
EU countries must:
designate a single authority responsible for aviation security;
set up a national civil aviation security programme to define responsibilities for implementing the common basic standards;
set up a national quality control programme to check the quality of civil aviation security.
Airports, air carriers and entities must:
define and implement a security programme;
ensure internal quality control.
Commission inspections
The Commission carries out inspections in cooperation with national authorities including unannounced inspections of airports, air carriers and other relevant persons or businesses. Any shortcomings must be remedied by the national authority. National authorities are responsible for primary quality control and enforcement, and therefore must carry out audits and inspections of airports, air carriers and other relevant persons or businesses.
Recognition of equivalent aviation security standards with non-EU countries
The EU may recognise non-EU countries’ aviation security standards as equivalent to EU standards to allow a ‘one-stop security’ system. This means, for example, that passengers arriving at EU airports and transferring to other destinations would no longer need to be re-screened. This would result in faster connection times, lower costs and greater convenience for travellers. ‘One-stop security’ is one of the objectives of EU aviation security legislation.
Implementation reports
Every year, the Commission publishes a report on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008. The latest report, relating to 2017, was published in 2019.
COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic severely limits the capability of EU countries and the EU as a whole to maintain an effective and efficient in-bound supply chain. Continued and uninterrupted cargo services are of essential strategic importance for the Union and play a fundamental role in the delivery of essential goods, including medicines, medical equipment, other substances and commodities.
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/910 therefore amends Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 as regards re-designating airlines, operators and entities providing security controls for cargo and mail arriving from non-EU countries, as well as postponing certain regulatory requirements.
The Annex to Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 is amended to take account of factors such as the pandemic’s impact on the performance of on-site installations, checks and visits, and the need to adopt urgent measures establishing the appropriate legal basis to implement an alternative and expedite process for the EU aviation security validations of EU-bound supply chain operators affected.

A European Union military operation in the Mediterranean (European Union Naval Force Mediterranean operation IRINI)
SUMMARY OF:
Decision (CFSP) 2020/472 on a European Union military operation in the Mediterranean
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?
It sets up European Union Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) operation IRINI (Greek for ‘peace’), whose primary role is to implement the arms embargo on Libya established by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1970 (2011), 2292 (2016) and 2473 (2019) by using its military aerial, satellite and maritime resources.
Operation IRINI’s secondary tasks are to: prevent the illegal export of oil from Libya;train and develop the Libyan coast guard and navy in their law enforcement duties, particularly against human smuggling and trafficking;help clamp down on human smuggling and trafficking by gathering information and patrolling the high seas.
KEY POINTS
              
To implement the arms embargo, operation IRINI:
monitors and gathers information on illegal exports of arms and related material, petroleum, crude oil and refined petroleum products;
inspects vessels to and from Libya suspected of carrying arms;
seizes and disposes of any weapons found;
collects personal data of people found trafficking;
shares information it gathers with the relevant national, EU and international authorities;
may divert vessels breaking the arms embargo to a specified port;
establishes a crime information cell of national and EU law enforcement authorities to handle and process the information collected.
Decision (CFSP) 2021/542 amends Decision (CFSP) 2020/472 and specifies the arrangements for disposing of arms and related military equipment seized when implementing the United Nations (UN) arms embargo on Libya, including the storage, destruction and transfer of seized items to an EU Member State or to a third party.
The European Peace Facility, set up under Decision (CFSP) 2021/509 – see summary – bears the costs for storage and disposal of arms and related military equipment seized by operation IRINI within its area of operations, including costs related to the necessary port services. The facility also bears the costs for any financial liability resulting from the diversion of a vessel or from subsequent actions related to the transportation, storage and disposal of the seized items, except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct by the Member State assisting in the disposal or by any of its agents.
The political control and strategic direction of operation IRINI are provided by the following.
The Political and Security Committee, which reconfirms authorisation of the operation every 4 months and reports regularly to EU governments.
The EU Military Committee (set up by Decision 2001/79/CFSP), which monitors the operation.
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who: ensures IRINI is consistent with the EU’s overall foreign policy, including its development programmes and humanitarian assistance;acts as main contact point with the UN and other international and bilateral actors, including countries in the region;may share EU classified and non-classified information with non-EU countries and bodies, such as the International Criminal Court, the UN and Interpol.
Operation IRINI’s initial mandate ran until 31 March 2021. Amending Decision (CFSP) 2021/542 extended the mandate until 31 March 2023.
Operation IRINI’s operational headquarters are in Rome under the command of Rear Admiral Stefano Turchetto.

Combating Document Fraud: the False and Authentic Documents Online System
Combating Document Fraud: the False and Authentic Documents Online System
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2020/493 on the false and authentic documents online (FADO) system
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It repeals Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA (see summary) which originally established the European image archiving system on false and authentic documents online (FADO).
It sets out a new legal basis for the FADO system, updating its management system by adapting it to the new institutional base set out in Article 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
KEY POINTS
The false and authentic documents online system
The FADO system contains information on authentic documents issued by EU countries, the EU and third parties (such as non-EU countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law) and on false versions of those documents.
It aims to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by: sharing information on the security features of, and potential fraud characteristics in, authentic and false documents between the EU countries’ authorities competent in the area of document fraud;sharing information with other actors, including the general public.
Scope
The FADO system contains information on documents issued by EU countries or the EU. Documents include: travel, identity, residence and civil status documents;driving licences and vehicle licences.
It may also contain information on: equivalent documents issued by third parties;other related official documents, in particular those used in support of applications for official documents, issued by EU countries and, where applicable, third parties.
The information to be included in the system includes: information, including images, on authentic documents, specimens of those documents and their security features;information, including images, on false documents, whether forged, counterfeit or pseudo documents, and their fraud characteristics;summaries of forgery techniques;summaries of the security features of authentic documents;statistics on detected false documents.
The system may also contain handbooks, contact lists, information on valid travel documents and their recognition by EU countries, recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of falsification and other useful related information.
The EU countries, the EU and third parties must submit this information to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) set up by Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 — see summary. Technical support for Frontex can be provided by eu-LISA, which was set up by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 — see summary.
Access
The FADO system provides users with different levels of access to information:
The European Commission and Frontex, to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks, and relevant national authorities, such as police, border guard and other law enforcement authorities, have secure access to the FADO system on a need-to-know basis.
The general public has access to specimens of authentic documents or authentic documents with pseudonymous data.
Other actors can gain access to information stored in the FADO system in a limited manner: other EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, including Europol, which was set up by Regulation (EU) 2016/794 — see summary;third parties, such as non-EU countries, territorial entities, international organisations and other entities subject to international law;private entities, such as airlines and other carriers.
Personal data is protected by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — see summary: use of data by police and judicial authorities is specifically protected by Directive (EU) 2016/680 — see summary.Frontex must apply the rules set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 — see summary.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 26 April 2020.
BACKGROUND
              
The regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis which, on the basis of protocols attached to the Lisbon Treaty, certain EU countries can opt in or out of.
Denmark did not take part in the adoption of the regulation and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application. It can however decide to opt in within a period of 6 months after the regulation takes effect.
Ireland, a non-member of the Schengen-zone, has chosen to take part.
The agreement applies additionally to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

Proportionality test for new regulation of professions
Proportionality test for new regulation of professions
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2018/958 — proportionality test before adoption of new regulation of professions
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
              
It establishes rules for proportionality assessments to be conducted by EU countries before adopting new professional regulations or amending existing regulations.
It aims to:
prevent undue restrictions on access to or the pursuit of professional activities;
ensure: transparency;the proper functioning of the internal market.
KEY POINTS
Regulated professions
The directive applies to new rules in EU countries which restrict access to or the pursuit of regulated professions.
A regulated profession means that the access to or the pursuit of a professional activity or group of professional activities is restricted, by regulation, to people having specific professional qualifications. This also covers the use of professional titles which are restricted to holders of specific qualifications.
Public interest
EU countries must ensure that any new or amending rules are justified and proportionate with regard to public interest objectives recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union, such as:
public policy, public security or public health;
protecting consumers, the recipients of services, and workers;
safeguarding the effectiveness of fiscal supervision;
combating fraud and preventing tax evasion and avoidance;
protection of the environment.
Assessment of new measures beforehand and monitoring afterwards
EU countries must:
assess the proportionality of a measure before introducing new, or amending existing, legislative, regulatory or administrative rules; and
monitor the compliance of such measures with the principle of proportionality after their adoption.
Assessment
The assessment must be:
accompanied by a sufficiently detailed explanation which allows for an assessment of whether it complies with the principle of proportionality;
undertaken on the basis of qualitative, and where possible, quantitative evidence;
carried out in an open and objective manner.
Proportionality
In assessing the proportionality of new or amending rules, EU countries must consider a number of proportionality criteria established by the Court of Justice, including:
whether the measure can achieve the public interest objective, and whether that objective is being pursued in a consistent and systematic manner for comparable activities;
whether existing rules, such as product safety law or consumer protection law, are not able to achieve the objective;
the impact on the free movement of persons and services within the EU, on consumer choice and on the quality of the service provided;
whether less restrictive means could achieve the public interest objective;
the effect of new rules when combined with other requirements.
Transparency
Before introducing new regulations, EU countries must:
make information available to the relevant people concerned; and
must give them the opportunity to make their views known.
The reasons for proportionality need to be recorded in the Regulated Professions Database and made publicly available.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has applied since 29 July 2018 and has to become law in the EU countries from 30 July 2020.
BACKGROUND
              
This directive is a part of the ‘Services package’ which aims to make it easier for companies and professionals to provide services to EU consumers. The package, published on 10 January 2017, contains two additional legislative proposals:
Proposal for a services e-card (European Commission)
Proposal for a services notification procedure (European Commission).

BACKGROUND
The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (European Commission)
KEY TERMS
              
Transshipping: the transfer of a catch from a smaller fishing boat to a larger one, which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.
Vulnerable marine ecosystems: any marine ecosystem the integrity (i.e. ecosystem structure or function) of which is, according to the best scientific information available and to the precautionary principle, threatened by significant adverse impacts resulting from physical contact with bottom gears in the normal course of fishing operations, including reefs, seamounts, cold water corals or cold water sponge beds.
Bottom fishing: fishing by any fishing vessel using any gear which is likely to come in contact with the seafloor or benthic organisms (i.e. those found in the ecological region at the lowest level of the ocean) during the normal course of operations.
Exploratory fishing: fishing in an area that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique in the previous 10 years.
Deepwater gillnets: single or, less commonly, double- or triple-netting mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear. Those nets can be used either alone or, as is more usual, in large numbers placed in line (‘fleets’ of nets). The gear can be set, anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected with the vessel.

Governance of the energy union
Governance of the energy union
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the governance of the energy union and climate action
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure that the European Union’s (EU) energy union strategy is implemented in a coordinated and coherent manner across its five dimensions.
More broadly, it also aims to ensure that the EU achieves its objectives, in particular the targets of the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy and of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
KEY POINTS
              
The energy union strategy has five dimensions:
decarbonisation,
energy efficiency,
energy security,
the internal energy market,
research, innovation and competitiveness.
The regulation has a number of key features.
It requires EU Member States: to produce national integrated energy and climate plans for 2021 to 2030 by 31 December 2019, and subsequently by 1 January 2029 and every ten years thereafter;to prepare long-term low-emission strategies with a 50-year perspective and report them to the European Commission, in view of contributing to broader sustainable development goals and the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement;to produce biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans, from 15 March 2023 onwards, to track progress across the five dimensions of the energy union.
It establishes a repeated consultation process between the Commission and Member States and fosters regional cooperation between Member States, especially before the plans are finalised, and then every 10 years for the following 10-year periods. For 2021–2030, the plans need to be updated by 30 June 2024.
It requires the Commission to monitor and assess Member States’ progress towards the targets, objectives and contributions set in their national plans.
It sets out the requirements for national and EU inventory systems for greenhouse gas emissions, policies, measures and projections.
Amending legislation
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, known as the European climate law, amends Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. It sets a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% (compared with 1990 levels) by 2030, and undertakes to set a climate target for 2040 within 6 months of the first global stocktaking under the Paris Agreement.
Delegated acts
The Commission has the power to adopt delegated acts to adapt the national energy and climate plans template to amendments to the EU’s energy and climate policy framework that are directly and specifically related to the EU’s contributions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.
It also has the power to adopt delegated acts to take account of changes in the global warming potentials and internationally agreed inventory guidelines, to set substantive requirements for the EU inventory system and to set up the registries.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1044 supplements Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 with regard to values for global warming potentials and the greenhouse gas inventory guidelines, and with regard to the EU’s inventory system: it repeals Delegated Regulation (EU) No 666/2014 from 1 January 2021;it applies to reports submitted by Member States from 2021 onwards;Member States and the Commission will use the global warming potentials listed in its Annex I for the purpose of determining and reporting greenhouse gas inventories data.
Implementing acts
The Commission has adopted two implementing acts:
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1208 on the structure, format, submission processes and review of information that Member States report in line with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999; and
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 on the EU’s renewable energy financing mechanism.
Repeal
The regulation repeals Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 on the monitoring and reporting mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions.

Summary 130:
Protecting health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants
Protecting health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 on persistent organic pollutants
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to protect human health and the environment by eliminating, or restricting the production and use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as defined in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants or the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
It seeks to minimise, or eliminate where possible, releases of such substances, and regulate waste containing or contaminated by them. The regulation particularly takes into account the precautionary principle.
KEY POINTS
              
POPs are potentially dangerous chemical substances which may cross international boundaries, are found often far from their emission sources, persist in the environment, bioaccumulate*, and consequently pose a threat to human health and the environment.
Controls on manufacture, placing on the market*, and use
The production and placing on the market of POPs listed in Annex I, whether on their own, in mixtures or in an article*, is banned. The production, placing on the market and use of POPs listed in Annex II is restricted to uses where locally safe, effective and affordable alternatives are not available to the country in question.
EU countries and the European Commission must apply appropriate controls to existing substances (such as through listing) and prevent the production, placing on the market and use of any new substances which exhibit characteristics of POPs.
EU countries may forward suggestions for listing to the Commission which, supported by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), decides whether to propose additional substances for listing. The ECHA also has a general advisory and informational role in the processes described in the regulation.
Exemptions
Exemptions from these controls are allowed for substances used for laboratory-scale research or as a reference standard, or which are present as an unintentional trace contaminant in mixtures or articles.
Other exemptions apply to articles containing POPs manufactured prior to the regulation taking effect, subject to specific assurances and conditions, including requirements for notification to the Commission and the Stockholm Convention Secretariat.
Release reduction, minimisation and elimination
EU countries must:
keep inventories of substances listed in Annex III released into air, water and land;
communicate their action plans on measures to identify, characterise and minimise the release of substances, including the use of substitute or modified substances;
give priority to alternative processes which avoid the formation and release of POPs when constructing or modifying facilities.
Waste
Those who produce or hold waste must avoid the waste being contaminated, as far as possible, with substances listed in Annex IV.
In most cases, contaminated waste must be disposed of or recovered* quickly to ensure that the POP content is destroyed or transformed.
EU countries must ensure that the production, collection and transportation of contaminated waste, as well as its storage and treatment, are traceable and carried out in conditions providing protection for the environment and human health.
Planning, monitoring and reporting
EU countries must give the public the opportunity to participate in this process and their implementation plans must be publicly available and shared with the Commission and the ECHA, including information on measures taken at national level to identify and assess sites contaminated by POPs, as appropriate. The Commission must also maintain an implementation plan which is to be reviewed and updated as appropriate.
A monitoring mechanism must be established to gather comparable monitoring data on the presence of substances as listed in Part A of Annex III of the regulation in the environment. EU countries will also report on the implementation of the regulation.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend the list of substances in Annexes I, II and III of this regulation to adapt them to changes to the list of substances set out in the annexes to the Stockholm Convention or the 1979 Protocol.
The regulation repeals and recasts Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 15 July 2019.

Summary 131:
Single-use plastics ban
Single-use plastics ban
SUMMARY OF:
Directive (EU) 2019/904 — on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?
It aims to prevent and reduce the impact on the environment of certain plastic products and to promote a transition to a circular economy by introducing a mix of measures tailored to the products covered by the directive, including an EU-wide ban on single-use plastic products whenever alternatives are available.
The directive delivers on the EU’s plastic strategy, an important element in the EU’s move towards a circular economy.
KEY POINTS
Scope
Single-use plastics are made wholly or partly of plastic and are typically intended to be used just once or for a short period of time before they are thrown away.
Market restrictions (bans)
The plastic products to be banned under the directive include:
cutlery (forks, knives, spoons, chopsticks);
plates;
straws;
cotton bud sticks;
beverage stirrers;
sticks to be attached to and to support balloons;
food containers made of expanded polystyrene;
products made from oxo-degradable plastic.
Consumption reductions
In line with the EU’s waste policy, EU countries are required to: take measures to reduce the consumption of certain single-use plastics for which there is no alternative (drinking cups including covers and lids, and containers of prepared food for immediate consumption);monitor consumption of these single-use products as well as the measures taken and report the progress made to the European Commission.
The directive requires an ambitious and sustained quantitative reduction in consumption of these products by 2026 (compared to a 2022 baseline).
Separate collection and design requirements for plastic bottles
The directive sets a collection target of 90% recycling for plastic bottles by 2029 (with an interim target of 77% by 2025).
These bottles should contain at least 25% recycled plastic in their manufacture by 2025 (for PET bottles), and 30% by 2030 (for all bottles).
Compulsory marking
Certain disposable plastic products placed on the market must carry a visible, clearly legible and indelible marking affixed to its packaging or to the product itself:
sanitary items;
wet wipes;
tobacco products with filters; and
drinking cups.
These labels should inform consumers about:
appropriate waste management options for the product or what type of waste disposal should be avoided for the product; and
the presence of plastics in the product as well as the negative environmental impact of littering.
Extended producer responsibility
The directive incorporates the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Producers will have to cover the costs of:
waste management clean-up;
data-gathering; as well as
awareness raising for the following products: food and beverage containers,bottles,cups,packets and wrappers,light-weight carrier bags, andtobacco products with filters.
For wet wipes and balloons, these obligations will apply with the exception of the collection costs.
EU countries are also required to:
ensure rules on extended producer responsibility (EPR) for fishing gear containing plastic are in place; and
monitor and assess plastic fishing gear with a view to establishing EU-wide collection targets.
Awareness raising
EU countries must also take measures to:
inform consumers and to encourage responsible consumer behavior in order to reduce litter from such products;
make consumers aware of reusable alternative products and the impact of inappropriate disposal of single-use plastic waste on the sewage system.
FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?
              
It has to become law in the EU countries by 3 July 2021. The market restrictions and marking of product rules apply from 3 July 2021, while the product design requirements for bottles apply from 3 July 2024. The Extended producer responsibility measures apply from 31 December 2024.

Notice concerning the entry into force of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and of the Agreement concerning security procedures for exchanging and protecting classified information
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISIONS, THE AGREEMENTS AND THE DECLARATIONS?
The decisions cover the signing and application of the free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU and the EU Member States.
The agreement is designed to go further than a traditional free trade agreement and provide a solid basis to preserve friendship and cooperation in the future. It reflects the fact that the UK is leaving the EU’s system of common rules, supervision and enforcement mechanisms, and will no longer enjoy the benefits of the EU’s single market.
The declarations set out political decisions agreed between the 2 parties on a number of specific issues and policy areas.
KEY POINTS
              
The agreement is divided into 7 parts followed by 3 protocols and more than 600 pages of annexes.
Part 1: Common and institutional rules
This part lays out the aims of the agreement, rules for supplementary agreements between the parties and sets out the institutional structure, including the Partnership Council committees and working groups designed to ensure the proper functioning of the agreement.
Part 2: Trade, transport, fisheries and other arrangements
This part is subdivided into several headings:
1.Trade — this heading covers a number of areas including:
trade in goods — including an agreement for zero tariffs or quotas on goods traded, mutual recognition of trusted traders programmes, and rules of origin;
services and investments — includes an agreement for equal treatment for EU service suppliers and investors in the UK and vice versa;
digital trade — includes the removal of unjustified barriers to digital trade, including prohibition of data localisation requirements, while respecting data protection rules;
energy — includes guarantees on security of energy supply, offshore energy cooperation in the North Sea, enforceable commitments towards the Paris Agreement and non-regression on climate change and carbon pricing;
a level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development.
2. Aviation — the agreement includes:
unlimited point-to-point traffic between EU and UK airports;
cooperation on aviation safety, security and air traffic management;
rules on ground-handling and slots (non-discrimination and access), and passenger rights.
3. Road transport — the agreement includes:
unlimited point-to-point access for hauliers carrying loads between the EU and the UK and full transit rights across each other’s territories;
rules on working conditions, road safety, fair competition, and a level playing field regarding the environment, social issues and competition.
4. Social security coordination and visas for short term visits — the agreement includes:
coordination of some social security benefits (old-age and survivors’ pensions, pre-retirement, healthcare, maternity and paternity, accidents at work) making it easier to work abroad and not lose rights;
non-discrimination clause ensures equal treatment of EU citizens for short-term visas.
5. Fisheries — the agreement includes:
new arrangements ensure sustainable management of shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters, respecting both parties’ rights and obligations as independent coastal states;
a transition period of five and a half years during which reciprocal access rights to fish in each other’s waters remain unchanged, with a gradual transfer of EU quotas to the UK.
Part 3: Law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters
The agreement ensures that the parties will work together in a number of ways including:
continued cooperation between UK, Europol and Eurojust;
arrangements for close cooperation between national police and judicial authorities of the UK and EU Member States, including on surrender;
mechanisms for swift exchanges of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, of DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration data (Prüm), and of criminal record information;
cooperation on money-laundering and terrorist financing.
Part 4: Thematic cooperation
The agreement ensures cooperation on certain other issues including:
cross-border health security threats;
sharing classified information and best practice in the field of cyber security, including the opportunity for the UK to take part in the EU Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA).
Part 5: Participation in EU programmes, sound financial management and financial provisions
The UK will take part in 5 EU programmes open to non-EU country participation (subject to its financial contribution):
Horizon Europe (research and innovation);
Euratom Research and Training programme;
ITER (fusion test facility);
Copernicus (Earth monitoring system);
Access to EU satellite surveillance & tracking (SST) services.
Part 6: Dispute settlement and horizontal rules
If a solution to a disagreement cannot be found between the parties, an independent arbitration tribunal can be set up to settle the matter through a binding ruling. This dispute settlement mechanism covers most areas of the agreement, including the level playing field and fisheries.
The mechanism is accompanied by enforcement and safeguard mechanisms including the possibility to suspend market access commitments, e.g. by reintroducing tariffs and/or quotas in the affected area.
Both parties will also be able to cross-retaliate* if the other does not comply with a ruling of an independent arbitration tribunal.
Any substantial breach of obligations deemed ‘essential elements’ (fighting climate change, respecting democratic values and fundamental rights, or non-proliferation) can trigger the suspension or termination of all or part of the entire agreement.
Part 7: Final provisions
The agreement does not apply to Gibraltar nor to British overseas territories.
The agreement and any supplementary agreements will be reviewed every 5 years.
Annexes and protocols
There are numerous annexes to the agreement covering issues such as:
rules of procedure of the Partnership Council and committees;
rules of origin;
motor vehicles, equipment and parts;
medical products;
rules for authorised economic operators;
guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications.
The are 3 protocols attached to the agreement:
Protocol on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax and for mutual assistance for the recovery of claims related to tax and duties — this protocol sets out the rules and procedures for cooperation in this field.
Protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters — this protocol is designed to enable the two parties to assist each other in ensuring the correct application of customs legislation, in particular by preventing, investigating and combating operations in breach of that legislation.
Protocol on social security coordination — this protocol sets out the rules for coordination on: sickness benefits;maternity and paternity benefits;invalidity benefits;old-age benefits.

Summary 133:
European Union trade mark
European Union trade mark
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 on the European Union trade mark
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes EU-wide rules and conditions for the granting of an EU trade mark.
It codifies and replaces Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and its numerous successive amendments.
KEY POINTS
EU trade mark
Any person or company, including authorities established under public law, may obtain an EU trade mark through registration.
It may consist of any signs, in particular words (including personal names), designs, letters, numerals and the shape of goods or of their packaging, provided that such signs are capable of:
distinguishing the goods or services of one business from those of another; and
being represented on the register of trade marks in such a way that the public and the authorities know exactly the subject matter that is being protected.
Owner’s rights
It grants the owner exclusive rights, which prohibit third parties from using any of the following for commercial purposes:
any sign which is identical with the EU trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered;
any sign where there is a likelihood of confusion with another trade mark;
any sign which is identical with, or similar to, the EU trade mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the EU trade mark is registered, where use of that sign takes advantage of the reputation and distinctive character of the trade mark.
However, the owner of the EU trade mark may not prohibit third parties from using the following for commercial purposes:
the owner’s own name or address;
indications concerning characteristics of goods or services such as the kind, quality or quantity;
the trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, as accessories or spare parts.
Application
Applicants must file an application for an EU trade mark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).
The application must contain the following information:
a request for the registration of a EU trade mark,
information identifying the applicant,
a list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested,
a representation of the trade mark.
Applicants must also pay an application fee. The application fee must be paid within 1 month of the filing date — the date on which the documents are filed with the EUIPO.
Registration
Once the application has been filed, EUIPO will examine whether it meets all the conditions for the granting of an EU trade mark.
Publication of the application will allow third parties opposed to the granting of the trade mark to do so, on the basis of earlier rights, in opposition proceedings.
If the application meets all the required criteria and no opposition is either entered or accepted, then the trade mark registration is published.
Duration and renewal
EU trade marks are registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the application.
Registration may be renewed for further periods of 10 years. The renewal application must be filed 6 months before the end of the validity of the registration.
Surrender, revocation and invalidity
An EU trade mark may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered. The rights of the owner may also be revoked if:
the trade mark has not been subject to genuine use* in the EU for 5 years;
the trade mark has become the common name for a product or service;
the trade mark could deceive the public as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of the goods or services.
The regulation also establishes grounds for invalidity of the trade mark. These grounds include, for example, cases where the applicant acted in bad faith when filing the application for the trade mark.
EU collective marksWhen an application for registration is filed, it is possible to designate an EU trade mark as being collective. The following are authorised to file EU collective marks — associations of:
manufacturers
producers
suppliers of services
traders
legal persons governed by public law.
EU certification marksIt is also possible to designate an EU trade mark as a certification mark. The owner of such a mark certifies the material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics (excluding geographical origin) of the certified goods and services.
Legal action
Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 applies to proceedings relating to EU trade marks and applications for EU trade marks, as well as to simultaneous and successive actions on the basis of EU and national trade marks.EU countries must designate ‘EU trade mark courts’. These courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all disputes concerning the infringement and validity of EU trade marks.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 October 2017.
BACKGROUND
              
EUIPO replaces the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market from 23 March 2016 in line with Regulation (EU) 2015/2424 which amended Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 both of which were replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 .
For more information, see:
EUIPO — trade marks.
KEY TERMS
              
Genuine use: if a company registers an EU trade mark, uses it for a period and then stops using it for a continuous period of 5 years, the trade mark may be revoked. This is because there is no value in giving protection to trade marks if they are not being used and there is no interest in preventing another company, that might legitimately wish to use the mark, from using it.

Regulation implementing the Marrakesh Treaty in the EU
Regulation implementing the Marrakesh Treaty in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1563 on the cross-border exchange between EU and non-EU countries of accessible format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It sets out the rules for how works or other subject matter* in accessible format copies* are shared between the EU and non-EU countries that are party to the Marrakesh Treaty, for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, and without needing copyright holder permission.
KEY POINTS
The Marrakesh Treaty
The Marrakesh Treaty requires countries who sign up to it to adopt national laws encouraging books to be produced in accessible formats, such as braille, e-text, audio or large print, aimed at people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled. These laws should also make it easier to share these items across national boundaries without needing authorisation by the copyright holder. The treaty was signed in 2013 and was ratified by the EU on 1 October 2018. The EU became a party to the treaty on 1 January 2019.
This regulation
An EU country authorised entity* is permitted to make available to beneficiary persons*, or to any authorised entities in non-EU countries which are party to the treaty, accessible versions of books or other written materials allowed by Directive (EU) 2017/1564, the directive implementing the Marrakesh Treaty in the EU, and these items may also be imported and used by such persons or entities.

Cooperation between national authorities on consumer protection laws
Cooperation between national authorities on consumer protection laws
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 — cooperation between national authorities for the enforcement of consumer protection laws
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to protect consumers against cross-border infringements to EU consumer law by modernising the cooperation of the relevant national authorities in EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries among themselves and with the European Commission.
The new rules help increase consumers’ and businesses’ trust in e-commerce within the EU.
It repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 as of 17 January 2020.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation covers 26 EU laws that protect consumers’ interests listed in its annex (new ones may be added in the future to extend the scope of the Regulation to new legislative areas) and it applies in case of any infringement of those laws.
These infringements can be:
intra-EU infringements: where consumers live in an EU country other than that in which the infringement took placethe trader responsible is based orwhere the relevant evidence or assets are to be found;
widespread infringements: an act or an omission contrary to EU consumer protection law that harms or is likely to harm the collective interests of consumers in at least 2 EU countries other than the country in which it originated or took placethe trader responsible for it is basedwhere the evidence or assets of the trader involved are to be found; or
any acts or omissions contrary to EU consumer protection laws that harm or are likely to harm the collective interests of consumers and that have common features, including the same unlawful practicethe same interest being infringed andthat are occurring concurrentlycommitted by the same trader, in at least 3 EU countries;
widespread infringements with an EU dimension: the consumers affected reside in at least two thirds of the EU countries, representing at least two thirds of the EU population.
The infringement can be an act or an omission, and may have ceased before enforcement starts or is completed.
Competent authorities
Each EU country must designate and provide resources for:
a single liaison office responsible for coordinating investigation and enforcement activities and for ensuring effective cooperation;
one or more competent authorities responsible for the application of the regulation.
EU countries may also involve designated bodies, where necessary, to gather information regarding an infringement or to take enforcement measures, under certain conditions of the regulation.
The regulation lists the minimum investigative and enforcement powers of the competent authorities, including the power to obtain commitments from a trader to cease an infringement or to provide remedies to the affected consumers .
Moreover, authorities will also be able to:
request information from domain registrars and banks to detect the identity of the responsible trader;
carry out test purchases (‘mystery shopping’) to check geographical discrimination or after-sales conditions (e.g. withdrawal rights); and
order the removal of online content if necessary.
Mutual assistance
For intra-EU infringements, the regulation lays out the procedure for requests for information and for enforcement measures from one EU country to another.
Authorities must respond to requests for information within 30 days unless otherwise agreed, and must apply appropriate enforcement measures without delay and normally within 6 months. The regulation also covers the conditions under which such a request may be turned down.
Coordinated action
Where there is a reasonable suspicion of a widespread infringement, the authorities concerned must alert without delay the Commission, other competent authorities and liaison offices, and launch coordinated action where agreed, with a designated coordinator.
The Commission must report any suspected infringements of which it has become aware to the national authorities. If there is a suspicion of a wide-scale EU-wide infringement, national authorities must conduct appropriate investigations and start a coordinated action if such investigations confirm that an infringement might be taking place. Coordinated actions to address widespread infringements with an EU dimension must always be coordinated by the Commission.
EU countries may refuse to participate in a coordinated action, for example if there are already judicial proceedings or if an investigation has shown that the actual or potential effects of the alleged infringement are negligible in that country.
EU-wide activities
The regulation also introduces a new EU-wide market alert system, so that emerging threats are detected more rapidly. This new alert system combines the system already existing under the consumer protection cooperation regulation (Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004) with a wider exchange of relevant and necessary information.
In addition, certain external bodies (such as consumer and trade associations, the European Consumer Centres and designated bodies given this power by the EU countries or by the Commission) will also be able to send alerts (‘external alerts’). This increases the role of stakeholders in the enforcement of consumer protection law.
The authorities may also decide to conduct sweeps* to detect infringements, but these must normally be coordinated by the Commission.
Data protection
Authorities may directly request relevant data from third parties in accordance with Directive 2000/31/EC (on e-commerce) and respecting data protection legislation (Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 on European Data Protection Supervisor, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — general data protection regulation (GDPR) and Directive (EU) 2016/680 — Protecting personal data when being used by police and criminal justice authorities).

Summary 136:
Ensuring the safety and performance of in vitro diagnostic medical devices
Ensuring the safety and performance of in vitro diagnostic medical devices
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It updates the rules on placing on the EU market, making available and putting into service in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices
*
for human use and their accessories.
It also contains rules on the conduct of performance studies
* that are carried out in the EU concerning IVD medical devices (or accessories).
It aims to improve patient safety by introducing stricter procedures for conformity assessment (to ensure that unsafe or non-compliant devices do not end up on the market) and post-market surveillance.
KEY POINTS
Scope
It covers IVD medical devices for human use and their accessories. However, devices manufactured and used in the same healthcare centre are exempted from the rules laid down by this regulation, other than the relevant general safety and performance requirements, so long as a number of conditions are fulfilled.
Classification system
The classification system for IVD medical devices has been adapted to the rapid scientific progress in the field and to the international guidance. They are classified according to their intended purpose and their inherent risks (classes A, B, C and D — for more details, see the regulation’s Annex VIII).
Notified bodies
The regulation tightens the rules concerning how the independent notified bodies — which assess the conformity of medium- and high-risk medical devices before they are placed on the market — are designated, organised and monitored.
These bodies have to meet the same high-quality standards throughout the EU and must have the required staff to successfully perform their conformity assessment tasks.
On-site inspections of manufacturers, of which some are unannounced, must be carried out.
Clinical data
The regulation specifies what is required in the data collection of performance studies on IVD medical devices. These have been aligned with those applicable for clinical trials on medicinal products. These include rules on informed consent and protecting vulnerable subjects (e.g. people under the age of 18, pregnant women or the incapacitated).
Performance studies conducted in more than one EU country will be subject to a coordinated assessment.
Manufacturers’ obligations
Manufacturers have clearer and more stringent obligations to monitor the quality, performance and safety of devices.
They are required to have measures in place that correspond to the level of risk, type of device and size of company. They must ensure they have sufficient financial coverage with respect to their potential liability under the product liability directive as well as quality management and post-market surveillance systems.
In the event of damages due to defective devices, a manufacturer’s authorised representative is jointly and severally liable.
Traceability
The regulation introduces a system for registering devices and manufacturers, importers and authorised representatives to ensure the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain by means of a unique device identification system. This will ensure that, should problems arise, measures can be taken rapidly.
High-risk devices
In the event of the first certification for class D IVD devices, and when common specifications are not available, designated reference laboratories will check the performance claimed by their manufacturers and an expert panel will be consulted on innovative devices of the same class. Although the notified body is not bound by the panel’s opinion, it has to provide a justification for not following it. Nevertheless, the notified body shall not deliver this first certificate if the scientific opinion of the EU reference laboratory is negative.
Genetic counselling
Patients tested with a genetic test must be provided with all relevant information on its nature, significance and implications. They must be given appropriate access to counselling in cases where a test provides information on the genetic predisposition for medical conditions and/or diseases which are generally considered to be untreatable.
Incident reporting
In addition to the obligation for manufacturers to report serious incidents (resulting in death or a serious deterioration in a person’s health) and trends in non-serious incidents (for example, side-effects from the use of a device), the regulation introduces the obligation for EU countries to encourage and enable healthcare professionals, users and patients to report suspected incidents at national level.
Market surveillance
Competent EU authorities are responsible for ensuring that any unsafe device is withdrawn from the market.
Eudamed
A centralised database, called the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) will be developed to provide EU countries, businesses, patients, healthcare professionals and the public with information on medical devices available in the EU.
Repeal of existing legislation — Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU
The regulation repeals Directive 98/79/EC and Decision 2010/227/EU from 26 May 2022, with some exceptions laid down in Article 112.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
							
It entered into force on 25 May 2017 and applies from 26 May 2022. Dates of application for some of the regulation’s articles vary and are detailed in Articles 110 and 113.
BACKGROUND
							
This regulation is one of 2 adopted by the EU to overhaul its laws on medical devices. The second regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) concerns medical devices.

Summary 137:
Ensuring accuracy and integrity of benchmarks
Ensuring accuracy and integrity of benchmarks
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 on indices used as financial benchmarks
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It sets common European Union (EU) standards to prevent manipulation of benchmarks* that could affect the price of financial instruments, or financial contracts such as loans or mortgages.
KEY POINTS
Administrators* responsible for the provision of financial benchmarks must: apply robust governance arrangements and clear organisational structures;identify, prevent or manage any potential conflicts of interest;ensure their staff have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience, and are effectively managed and supervised;maintain permanent and effective oversight of all aspects of the benchmarks under their responsibility;operate controls to ensure benchmarks comply with the legislation;have a system in place to record input data, phone or electronic communications and complaints received and investigated;subject any outsourcing to strict conditions;publish clear guidelines for different types of input data and the methodology used for calculating benchmarks;develop a code of conduct stipulating the responsibilities of contributors providing input data to the administrator.
The regulation establishes three separate regimes, progressively increasing the level of regulation and supervision depending on a benchmark’s importance: non-significant benchmarks do not fall into either of the two categories below and are subject to less onerous rules;significant benchmarks are used as a reference for financial instruments, financial contracts or investment funds with a total average value of at least €50 billion, or fulfil certain other criteria;critical benchmarks are used as a reference for financial instruments, financial contracts or investment funds with a total value of at least €500 billion, or fulfil certain other criteria.
Specific arrangements exist for commodity benchmarks*, interest rate benchmarks and regulated data benchmarks*.
Two types of EU climate benchmarks that are underpinned by a methodology linked to the commitments laid down in the Paris agreement were introduced into the regulation by amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2089.
The regulation also lays down environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements for all benchmarks, with the exception of interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) establishes and maintains a public register of all authorised or registered administrators.
Various schemes exist to provide access to the EU market for financial benchmarks and administrators from outside the EU.
EU Member States’ competent authorities have the power to apply appropriate administrative sanctions and other measures for an infringement.
The European Commission had to report on the system’s operation to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union by 1 January 2020.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2021/168 lays down rules enabling the Commission to designate a statutory replacement benchmark where a critical benchmark or a non-EU country benchmark that is of particular relevance in the EU ceases to be provided. This aims to reduce legal uncertainty regarding existing contracts and avoid risks to financial stability, and was prompted by the fact that, from January 2022, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) interest rate benchmark will cease to be published.
Delegated acts
Delegated acts adopted by the Commission include:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1637 with regard to technical standards in relation to the oversight function;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1642 with regard to technical standards specifying further the criteria to be taken into account by competent authorities when assessing whether administrators of significant benchmarks should apply certain requirements;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1816 as regards the explanation in the benchmark statement of how environmental, social and governance factors are reflected in each benchmark provided and published;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1817 as regards the minimum content of the explanation on how environmental, social and governance factors are reflected in the benchmark methodology;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 as regards minimum standards for EU climate transition benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned benchmarks;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1348 with regard to technical standards specifying the criteria under which competent authorities may require changes to the compliance statement of non-significant benchmarks;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1349 with regard to technical standards specifying the criteria for the competent authorities’ compliance assessment regarding the mandatory administration of a critical benchmark;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1350 with regard to technical standards specifying the requirements to ensure that an administrator’s governance arrangements are sufficiently robust;
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1351 with regard to technical standards specifying the characteristics of the systems and controls for the identification and reporting of any conduct that may involve manipulation or attempted manipulation of a benchmark; and
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1352 with regard to technical standards specifying the conditions to ensure that the methodology for determining a benchmark complies with the quality requirements.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 has applied since 1 January 2018, except for certain articles which have already applied since 30 June 2016. These articles largely involve preparatory work, such as the development by ESMA of regulatory technical standards, but also the identification and supervision of critical benchmarks. The regime applicable to the use of non-EU benchmarks in the EU will start to apply as of 31 December 2023.
Regulation (EU) 2021/168 has applied since 13 February 2021.
BACKGROUND
Benchmarks are used to price financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds. A well-known example of a benchmark is the euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), used for interbank interest rates. Benchmarks are also used for oil price assessments, stock market indexes and the level of personal mortgage payments.
For more information, see: Benchmarks — Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (European Commission)EU climate benchmarks and benchmarks’ ESG disclosures (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Benchmark. A figure which is made public and used to price payments under financial instruments or financial contracts, or to measure the performance of an investment fund.
Administrator. An individual or company/organisation that has control over a benchmark.
Commodity benchmark. A benchmark that measures the price of a commodity.
Regulated data benchmark. Benchmarks determined from input data that is provided by regulated venues, energy exchanges and emission allowance auctions.

Appliances burning gaseous fuels (from 2018)
Appliances burning gaseous fuels (from 2018)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2016/426 on appliances burning gaseous fuels
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It modifies and updates rules set out in earlier legislation (Directive 2009/142/EC).
It establishes the rules for the placing on the market and putting into service of appliances burning gaseous fuels and their fittings.
It provides access to the European Union (EU) market for the appliances and fittings covered as far as their gas safety is concerned.
It deals with the energy efficiency of these products, unless other more specific EU legislation applies.
KEY POINTS
Scope

Cross-border transportation of euro cash by road
Cross-border transportation of euro cash by road
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 — rules on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area countries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
The aim is twofold:
to ensure a more level-playing field for cash-intransit (CIT) companies providing transportation of euro cash by road in the euro area;
to ensure that the professional transport of euro cash by road between countries belonging to the euro area is competitive, secure and safe for both the staff concerned and the general public.
KEY POINTS
Rationale and scope
The introduction of the euro has increased the need for the cross-border transport of cash by road in euro area countries. Banks, the retail sector and other professional cash handlers should be able to contract with CIT companies offering the best price and/or service. They should also be entitled to take advantage of the cash services of the nearest national central bank branch or CIT cash centre, even if it is located in another euro-area country. Euro-area countries (‘participating countries’) also have the right to arrange for euro banknotes and coins to be produced abroad. Retailers and banks located in border areas may wish to obtain their supplies from the cash centre nearest to them, which is not necessarily in the same EU country. The very principle of a single currency implies the freedom to move cash between participating euro-area countries.
A full harmonisation of CIT transport in participating EU countries was not considered feasible, nor was a system considered appropriate where authorisation in one EU country would be valid in all EU countries (‘mutual recognition’). Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 lays down a set of common rules valid in all EU countries, without prejudice to national rules for certain aspects explicitly indicated in the regulation. It does not involve full harmonisation, as the common rules only apply to cross-border transport.
Cross-border CIT licence
Given the potential threats, associated with the activity of transporting cash, to the security of the staff of CIT companies and the general public, the cross-border transport of euro cash is subject to holding a specific cross-border CIT licence. National authorities grant this licence for a period of 5 years if CIT companies meet certain conditions, such as requirements for security staff or for vehicles.
The CIT licences are registered in the EU’s Internal Market Information System to allow public authorities to easily access them.
Staff carrying out cross-border CIT are entitled to the minimum rates of pay that apply in the host countries.
Cross-border transport of euro cash
The cross-border CIT licence grants the holder the right to transport euro banknotes and coins across borders by road, during daylight hours and only if both the majority of the pick-up or of the delivery is in the host country and the value of euro cash is at least 80 % of the total cash value transported in the vehicle. Some specific transport arrangements are explicitly exempted from the scope of the regulation, such as point-to-point transports to and from national central banks or cash production sites.
Transport arrangements
The regulation provides for 5 types of transport arrangements for euro banknotes and 2 types for euro coins. It defines the conditions of each, such as:
vehicle armouring;
the use of intelligent banknote neutralisation systems (IBNS);
the presence of CIT security staff.
The participating countries decide which transport arrangements apply in their territory.
Role of IBNS and removal of neutralised banknotes
The regulation seeks to facilitate the use of IBNS so as to improve the security of CIT security staff and the public. CIT companies must remove neutralised banknotes (banknotes rendered unusable to protect them against unauthorised access) from circulation so that they are no longer used for payment.
Host country rules applying to transport: national police force, public security and carrying of firearms
CIT aspects not covered by the common rules of the regulation are governed by national law, subject to the general rules of the treaty (such as the principle of non-discrimination), and must be respected in the host country by the CIT company carrying out the cross-border transport. These national rules concern:
the role of the police force (such as prior notification, escorting or distant remote tracking);
security rules on cash delivery or pick-up at locations; and
rules on firearms.
Notification and information
Licence holders must inform the participating country of the intended start of cross-border transport.
Participating countries must inform each other of cross-border business notified by the CIT companies.
On the Europa website, the European Commission publishes all information on: IBNS approved by participating countries;national rules on the role of police forces and on the security of locations where the cash is delivered or picked up from;national CIT training requirements;the credentials of the national granting authority; andthe host administration that has to be notified about the start of cross-border transport.
The Commission publishes the applicable transport arrangements as chosen by the participating countries in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Compliance checks, penalties and emergency security measures
Participating countries carry out compliance checks on CIT companies acting in their territory. Penalties can be applied in cases of non-compliance.
Competent authorities may introduce temporary security measures in the event of an urgent problem significantly affecting the security of CIT operations.
Review
Every 5 years, the Commission reports to the European Parliament and the Council on the regulation’s implementation.

Summary 140:
Labelling of foodstuffs
Labelling of foodstuffs
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on providing food information to consumers
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It seeks to guarantee consumers their right to information by establishing the general principles, requirements and responsibilities for the labelling of foodstuffs they consume.
It provides sufficient flexibility to respond to future developments in the food sector.
It merges the previous legislation, Directives 2000/13/EC on the labelling of foodstuffs and 90/496/EEC on nutritional labelling.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The legislation applies to businesses at all stages of the food chain and to all foods intended for final consumption. This includes food delivered by or supplied to mass caterers.
Responsibility to provide information
Responsibility for providing the necessary information, and ensuring it is accurate, lies with the manufacturer marketing the food under their name. If they are based outside the European Union (EU), it lies with the importer.
Mandatory information
Certain information is mandatory. This includes: the food’s namea list of ingredientsnet quantitya use-by dateinstructions for use, if necessarythe operator’s name and addressa nutrition declaration.
The general rule is that the indication of the country of origin or place of provenance is mandatory where failure to indicate this might mislead the consumer as to the true country of origin or place of provenance of the food. This is particularly the case if the information accompanying the food or the label as a whole would otherwise imply that the food has a different country of origin or place of provenance.
Origin labelling must be provided for fresh, chilled and frozen meat of swine, sheep, goats and poultry. Separate EU-level mandatory origin rules exist for foods such as honey (Directive 2001/110/EC), fruit and vegetables and olive oil (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), fish (Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013) and beef and beef products (Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000).
The mandatory information must be available at no extra cost to consumers who use distance selling to buy food, before they make their purchase.
The actual alcoholic strength must be given for any drinks with more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol.
Additional mandatory information must be given for certain types of foods, such as those containing sweeteners, ammonium salt or with a high caffeine count.
The net quantity of food and liquids must be expressed in litres, centilitres, millilitres, kilograms or grams.
Certain foods are exempt from the mandatory nutrition declaration, such as herbs and spices, flavourings and herbal teas.
Other foods — notably fresh fruit and vegetables, carbonated water, vinegars, and dairy items like cheese, butter, cream and fermented milk — do not need a list of ingredients.
Food information should not mislead the public, particularly by suggesting it possesses special characteristics or effects it does not have. It should be accurate, clear and easy for the consumer to understand.
The European Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/775, which builds on Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011’s Article 26(3) by laying down detailed rules for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food. In force since 1 April 2020, this regulation requires that the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient be indicated on the label if it is not the same as the given country of origin or the given place of provenance of the food. It also sets rules regarding the minimum font size and the positioning of this label.
In 2018, the Commission issued a notice on questions and answers on the application of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 to assist food business operators and national authorities in applying the regulation.
In 2020, the Commission issued a notice providing guidelines for food business operators and national authorities on applying the rules regarding labelling when the country of origin or place of provenance of a food is given and it is not the same as that of its primary ingredient, the country of origin or place of provenance.
FROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 13 December 2014, with the exception of the introduction of a nutrition declaration (from 13 December 2016) and the specific requirements concerning the designation of ‘minced meat’ (1 January 2014), and the indication of the primary ingredient (1 April 2020).
BACKGROUND
              
The free movement of safe and wholesome food in the EU is of major benefit to the public’s health and well-being and is an essential feature of the single market. In addition to guaranteeing a high level of health protection, EU law ensures that consumers have appropriate information to make informed choices in the food they buy and eat.

Issue of euro coins
Issue of euro coins
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 on the issuance of euro coins
Regulation (EU) No 729/2014 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 defines the types of euro coins and lays down the conditions to be respected at coin issue.
Regulation (EU) No 729/2014 sets the technical requirements of the euro coins and provides for general rules on their design including design approval.
KEY POINTS
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 states:
governments of euro area countries (countries that have the euro as their currency) may issue circulation coins* and collector coins*;
circulation coins are made available at their face value, except for a maximum of 5% which may be put on the market at a higher price because of their special qualities or packaging;
national commemorative coins*
may only be issued twice a year (unless the design is common to all euro area countries);
the total number issued must not be above one of two possible limits, whichever is higher, as a percentage of all 2-euro coins in circulation;
collector coins
are only legal tender* in the issuing euro area country;
must be clearly distinguishable from circulation coins in face value, images and in two of the following: colour, diameter and weight;
governments of euro area countries must consult each other before destroying damaged euro coins;
the Commission carries out an impact assessment, analysing the real production costs of 1- and 2-cent coins against their value and benefits.
Further to Regulation (EU) No 729/2014:
there are eight euro coins (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 and 2 euro);
each coin has a distinctive national and a common European side;
national sides must:
bear a circle of 12 stars fully surrounding the national design;
remain unchanged for 15 years, unless the country’s head of state changes;
not show the coin’s value, unless using a different alphabet;
comply fully with the regulation by 20 June 2062;
commemorative coins must:
only have a face value of 2 euros;
have a different national design from regular* 2-euro coins;
only commemorate subjects of major national or European relevance or
commemorate subjects of the highest European relevance if issued collectively throughout the euro area;
euro area countries must inform each other and the Commission of any proposed changes to their national designs and submit this to an approval procedure. This allows for objections from
a government that believes the design would upset its own public;
the Commission, if it considers the design does not respect the legislation’s technical requirements.
FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
Regulation (EU) No 651/2012 has applied since 16 August 2012.
Regulation (EU) No 729/2014 consolidates former rules regarding coins set when the euro was introduced in 2002 by the Regulation (EC) No 975/98 and successive amendments. It has applied since 22 July 2014.
Both Regulations have integrated the elements of the Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation.
BACKGROUND
Euro coins came into general use in 2002. The eight denominations vary in size, colour and thickness depending on their value and are designed to make any illegal reproduction extremely difficult.
For more information, see:
‘Euro notes and coins’ (European Commission).
* KEY TERMS
              
Circulation coins: coins for general public use which are legal tender in all euro area countries.
Collector coins: coins not intended for circulation, which are legal tender only in the euro area country where they are issued.
Commemorative coins: 2-euro circulation coins to commemorate a specific subject of national or European importance.
Legal tender: coins or banknotes that must be accepted in a country if offered in payment of a debt.
Regular coins: circulation coins excluding commemorative coins.

European Social Fund
European Social Fund
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 1304/2013 — the European Social Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets down principles, rules and standards for the implementation of the European Social Fund (ESF).
In 2014-2020, the ESF covers 4 main areas of investment: employment and in particular youth employment;social inclusion;education; andgood governance (i.e. improved quality of public administration).
KEY POINTS
              
Overall aimsThe ESF invests in people with the aim of improving employment and education opportunities across the EU. Over the 2014-2020 period, it aims to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups, including youth. The regulation describes the scope of the ESF and its relationship with the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI).
Key themes
The ESF focuses on a number of key themes including:
promoting employment and supporting labour mobility;
promoting social inclusion and combating poverty;
investing in education, skills and lifelong learning;
enhancing institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administration.
Eligible regionsAll EU countries are eligible for funding from the ESF. A wide range of organisations, from both the public and private sectors, can apply through the EU countries.
Budget priorities
For the first time, a minimum share has been introduced for the ESF, set at 23.1% of cohesion policy which corresponds to more than €80 billion earmarked for ESF programming during the 2014-2020 programming period.In each EU country, at least 20% of the ESF must be earmarked for social inclusion and combating poverty. This means helping vulnerable people and disadvantaged groups to get the skills and jobs they need to integrate in the labour market.The ESF must provide targeted help for young people by topping up the YEI with at least €3.2 billion. This initiative must exclusively support young people not in employment, education or training in regions experiencing youth unemployment rates above 25%.In light of the need to address the persistently high levels of youth unemployment in the EU, Regulation (EU) 2015/779 amends Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013. It increases the level of the initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015 from 1% to 30%.
Focus on resultsThe programmes must be results-oriented and based on the additionality principle*. The concentration mechanism (i.e. very focused measures on a given target group) is important in order to make a real impact on the ground.ImplementationPartnership Agreements and operational programmes, agreed between the EU countries and the European Commission, set the framework for strategic investments at national and regional level.
Public Private Partnerships
Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 stipulates that in relation to a Public Private Partnership (‘PPP’) operation a beneficiary may be a body governed by private law of an EU country (‘private partner’). The private partner (selected to implement the operation) may be replaced as beneficiary during implementation — where this is required — under the terms and conditions of the PPP or of the underlying financing agreement between the private partner and the financial institution co-financing the operation.
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/1076 lays down additional rules on the replacement of the beneficiary and on the related responsibilities. In the case of the replacement of a beneficiary in a PPP operation funded by European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs), it is necessary to ensure that after the replacement, the new partner or body provides at least the same service and with the same minimum quality standards, which was required by the initial PPP contract. This regulation also sets out procedures with regard to proposals to replace the private partner and confirmation of the private partner, as well as minimum requirements to be included in PPP agreements funded by ESIFs.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 21 December 2013.
BACKGROUND

Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 on European demographic statistics
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It seeks to regulate the harmonisation and provision of data on population and on vital events (i.e. births and deaths) linked to the population.
It lays down common definitions, subjects covered and characteristics of the required information, coverage, quality criteria and reporting deadlines and results although EU countries will compile the data using their own national sources and practices.
KEY POINTS
Why are these statistics important?
1.High-quality population estimates are vital for the EU’s democratic process, i.e. they are important in the calculation of the weighting of votes as in the case of qualified majority voting in the Council. Since 1 November 2014, a qualified majority is defined as at least 55 % of the members of the Council, comprising at least 15 of them and representing countries comprising at least 65 % of the population of the EU (double majority).
2.The long-term assessment of the sustainability of EU countries’ public finances is, among other things, conducted on the basis of Eurostat population projections; these, in turn, require timely, accurate, reliable and consistent time series on population, births and deaths, together with sound assumptions concerning the future development of fertility, life expectancy and migration flows.
3.Progress of the EU’s sustainable development strategy is assessed via the Eurostat monitoring report which uses time series on old-age dependency ratios, fertility rates and life expectancy in the EU.
4.Trends in achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion are assessed on the basis of regional demographic data.
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 205/2014 lays down uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 as regards the breakdown (i.e. disaggregation) of data, deadlines and data revisions.

Textile products: textile fibre names and labelling
Textile products: textile fibre names and labelling
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1007/2011 – fibre names labelling and the marking of the fibre composition of textile products
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
              
It seeks to ensure that EU consumers are properly informed and that the EU clothing and textile market operates smoothly.
It lays down rules on
textile fibre names with regard to their definition and use when indicating the fibre composition of textile products;
the labelling of textile products containing non-textile parts of animal origin;
methods of analysis to check information indicated on labels or markings.
KEY POINTS
              
The law covers:
products exclusively composed of textile fibres and
products treated in the same way as textile products, for example products containing at least 80 % by weight of textile fibres.
Exclusion: products contracted out to persons working at home, to independent firms or to self-employed tailors.
Fibre names
The description of fibre composition of textile products must use the textile fibres listed in the regulation’s Annex I.
Manufacturers may apply to the European Commission to include a new fibre name in Annex I to the regulation. They must submit a technical file drawn up in line with Annex II which lists minimum requirements.
Indication of the composition
The use of the terms ‘100 %’, ‘pure’ or ‘all’ is limited to textile products composed of a single textile fibre.
The terms ‘virgin wool’ or ‘fleece wool’ (and the terms listed in Annex III) may be used on labels only when the product is composed exclusively of a wool fibre which has not previously been incorporated in a finished product, and which has not been subjected to any spinning.
Products composed of  several fibres must be labelled with the name and percentage by weight of all constituent fibres, in descending order.
The presence of non-textile parts of animal origin (for example, a leather strap on a bag made of fabric) in textile products must be indicated by the phrase ‘Contains non-textile parts of animal origin’.
Labelling and marking of textile products
If they are to be sold to the consumer, they must be labelled and marked in a durable, legible, visible and accessible way, to indicate their fibre composition. Labelling or marking is the responsibility of those selling the products.
For products consisting of two or more textile components not having the same fibre composition, each component’s composition must appear.
Labelling must be offered in the official language(s) of the country where the product is sold.
Labelling is not required for products listed in Annex V.
Market surveillance
EU countries’ market surveillance authorities must check the fibre composition of textiles according to the methods in Annex VIII.

European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (2014-2020)
European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (2014-2020)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 — the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) aims to help coastal populations and those working in the fishing and aquaculture sectors to adapt to the newly reformed EU common fisheries policy (CFP) for the period 2014-2020.
KEY POINTS
Budget and priorities
With a budget of €6.5 billion for the 2014-2020 period, the EMFF aims to:
rebuild fish stocks, reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment and gradually eliminate discards — the dumping at sea of unwanted catches — returning fish to the sea either dead or alive because they are too small, because the fisherman has no quota to catch them or because of certain catch composition rules;
support small-scale, local fishing and young fishermen;
help communities to diversify their local economy;
fund projects that will create jobs and improve the quality of life on Europe’s coasts;
support European aquaculture (fish and shellfish farming);
finance the improvement of scientific knowledge of the marine environment and the collection of relevant data so that decisions are taken based on reliable information;
strengthen fishery control programmes;
support innovative investments in fishing vessels, for example, to improve fishing gear selectivity (gear that targets and captures fish by size and species and allows other fish to be avoided or to be released unharmed);
support (under certain conditions) investments in equipment or on board aimed at reducing the emission of pollutants or greenhouse gases;
improve the marketing and processing in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors;
support the EU’s integrated maritime policy by facilitating coordination across borders and between sectors (for example maritime spatial planning, integrated maritime surveillance and improving knowledge on the state of the marine environment).
Implementation
The EMFF co-finances projects with EU countries that provide national funding. EU countries draw up an operational programme stating how they intend to spend the money allocated. Once the European Commission approves these programmes, it is up to the national authorities to decide which projects will be funded.
Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the Commission has adopted rules mainly dealing with detailed technical aspects of its implementation. These include: how EU countries should present cumulative data on fishing operations and the information that they need to provide to the Commission;the contents and setting up of a system to monitor and evaluate the operations that receive funding;the format and presentation of annual reports of funded programmes;detailed conditions on interrupting and suspending of payments to EU countries that do not comply with the CFP rules.
A full list of implementing and delegated acts is available on the EMFF website.
COVID-19 pandemic — amendment to the regulation
Regulation (EU) 2020/560 amends Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 introducing specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a significant drop in demand for fishery and aquaculture products following the outbreak with serious socio-economic consequences in those communities where fishing and aquaculture play a major role.
The amended regulation allows the EMFF to provide support for: the temporary cessation of fishing activities, including for inland fishing and fishermen on foot;certain economic losses for aquaculture producers and processing enterprises and in the outermost regions, if they are due to the COVID‐19 outbreak.
The measures may also involve providing working capital to aquaculture producers and processing enterprises, and support for producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products.
This regulation also allows a more flexible reallocation of financial resources within the operational programme of each EU country and simplifies the procedure for amending operational programmes.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014. The temporary measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak apply retroactively as of 1 February 2020 and are available until 31 December 2020.
BACKGROUND
              
The EMFF is the financial instrument supporting the CFP for the 2014-2020 period. It is one of the 5 European Structural and Investment Funds that complement each other and aim to promote a recovery in Europe based on growth and jobs.

Key information about investment products
Key information about investment products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs)
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It obliges those who produce or sell investment products to provide retail investors with key information documents (KIDs) about the products.
The aim is to help investors to understand and compare the key features and risks of these products.
KEY POINTS
Key information for retail investors
The producer of an investment product intended to be sold to retail investors has to provide a KID concerning the product. Those selling or advising on these investment products have to provide the KID to an investor before any agreement is made.
KIDs should be a maximum of three pages long and provide clear information on a product, allowing the investor to take an informed investment decision.
KIDs should include the following information: the name of the product and the identity of the producer;the types of investors for whom the financial product is intended;the risk and reward profile of the financial product, which includes a summary risk indicator, the possible maximum loss of invested capital and appropriate performance scenarios of the product;the costs to be borne by the investor associated with the investment in the financial product;information about how and to whom an investor can make a complaint where there is a problem with the product or the person producing, advising on or selling the product.
‘Comprehension alert’ for investment products that are difficult to understand
When an investment product is very difficult to understand, the provider has to ensure the KID contains the following warning: ‘You are about to purchase a product that is not simple and may be difficult to understand’.
Investment products covered
The rules apply to packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (also known as PRIIPs). These are a standard range of investment products typically offered by a bank or financial advisers to consumers, for example, in order to save for a specific objective such as a house purchase or a child’s education.
They include investment funds, insurance-based investment products, retail-structured securities, structured deposits and structured products.
Delegated acts
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653, as amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2268, supplements Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014.
Its Annex I establishes a common template for the KID describing the purpose of the investment product to help investors understand the nature, risks, costs (entry/exit, ongoing and incidental costs), potential gains and losses of the product, and help them compare it with other products.
The KID must provide information such as: the name of the product and manufacturer, type of PRIIP, its investment objectives, intended retail investor;risks and return – a risk indicator including the risk and reward profile, a summary risk indicator, summary-risk-indicator-related narratives, including on possible maximum loss, and performance scenario templates and narratives;what happens if a PRIIP manufacturer is unable to pay out (information about the guarantee / compensation scheme, the risks covered and those not covered);costs over time and the composition of costs;the recommended holding period and information about disinvesting before maturity and applicable fees/penalties, if appropriate;how a retail investor can lodge a complaint.
Other aspects are addressed in subsequent annexes: Annex II – methodology for presenting risk;Annex III – presentation of the summary risk indicator;Annex IV – performance scenarios;Annex V – methodology for presenting performance scenarios;Annex VI – methodology for calculating costs;Annex VII – presentation of costs.

Summary 147:
Failing banks and investment firms: rules and procedures
Failing banks and investment firms: rules and procedures
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund
Regulation (EU) 2019/877 amending Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 sets out the structure of the Single Resolution Board (SRB). It is made up of a chair, a vice-chair, 4 permanent members and the authorities from all participating EU countries. It operates in: executive sessions: the chair, 4 further independent full-time members, 2 permanent observers appointed by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank (ECB) and, in specific cases, representatives of national resolution authorities of participating countries or other observers; andplenary sessions: the full board, as above, and representatives of all national resolution authorities of participating countries.
It introduces uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms through a single resolution mechanism and the use of a single resolution fund.
While the regulation applies to euro area countries, other EU countries are also allowed to participate.
Regulation (EU) 2019/877 amends the original regulation to incorporate in EU legislation international standards on loss-absorption and recapitalisation for banks set by the Financial Stability Board.
KEY POINTS
The Single Resolution Board
When a bank is deemed to be in a crisis situation, the board may put together a resolution scheme that is passed on to the Commission for formal approval. If the Commission has no objections, the scheme should be adopted within 24 hours. In some specific cases, the Commission can request the Council to approve its amendments to the scheme.
A resolution scheme of less than €5 billion from the single resolution fund is decided in executive session board meetings, which only include the national resolution authority from the EU country where the bank in crisis is located.
When more than €5 billion is needed, decisions are taken by the plenary session.
The single resolution fund
Funded by banks from 2016 onwards, the single resolution fund should amount to 1% of insured deposits in all participating EU countries (for a total of around €55 billion) in 2024. Along with Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, an intergovernmental agreement was signed between participating EU countries. This allows for: the transfer of banks’ contributions to national compartments of the fund; andthe progressive mutualisation* of those contributions in the fund.
Single resolution mechanism
Together, the SRB and the single resolution fund make up the single resolution mechanism. This system and the single supervisory mechanism, that gives supervisory powers to the ECB, are the foundations of the EU’s banking union, which applies to euro area countries. Other EU countries may also participate.
Banks covered
The SRB is responsible for the resolution of all banks that are supervised by the ECB. As in the case of the single supervisory mechanism, the SRB is directly responsible for the largest banks that are directly supervised by the ECB and for other cross-border banks.
Other banks remain under the direct responsibility of their national resolution authorities. However, they remain under the indirect responsibility of the SRB, and the SRB may step in if their resolution scheme requires the use of the single resolution fund.
Calculation of individual institutions’ contributions
Regulation (EU) 2015/81 lays down rules relating to the obligation of the SRB to calculate the contributions for individual institutions and the methodology for their calculation.
Loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms
In incorporating international standards on loss absorption and recapitalisation into EU law for global systemically important banks and amending the existing rules for other banks, Regulation (EU) 2019/877 provides for the rules for banks to deal with losses by ensuring that they hold enough capital and other liabilities to minimise as much as possible any taxpayer bail-outs.
WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 has applied since 1 January 2016. However, some rules, such as the start of the board’s activities, have applied since 1 January 2015.
Regulation (EU) 2019/877 applies from 28 December 2020.

Summary 148:
EU airport noise
EU airport noise
With increasing air traffic in prospect, the European Union has agreed new rules on how authorities take decisions setting noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports to limit nuisance from aircraft noise.
ACT
Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Union airports within a balanced approach and repealing Directive 2002/30/EC.
SUMMARY
Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 aims to improve the noise environment around EU airports in order to ensure greater compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular in the case of night flights. The rules are based on the principles of the Balanced approach to noise management agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations' body dealing with international civil aviation.
An operating restriction can take various forms, like setting a noise or a movement limit, introducing a non-addition rule (no additional movements or operations in general, or from a specific type of aircraft) or adopting a curfew for a period of night.
Scope
The rules apply only to larger airports with more than 50 000 civil aircraft movements per year. They cover civilian aircraft but exclude military, customs and police movements. The setting of specific noise thresholds, however, remains the preserve of national and local authorities.
Competent authorities
EU countries each appoint competent authorities which take charge of the procedures to be followed for the adoption of operating restrictions. These must be independent of any party that might have a conflict of interest.
Right of review
Before introducing operating restrictions, competent authorities have to give 6 months' notice to the other Member States, the European Commission and interested parties. The Commission may, within 3 months of receiving the notice, examine the case. If it considers the procedures do not respect the rules, it notifies the competent authority which must, in turn, inform it of the action it intends to take.
Health aspects
EU legislation regarding the impacts of noise on human health (Directive 2002/49/EC) must be taken into account when any decision is taken on noise reduction objectives.
Noise performance information
Decisions on operating restrictions must be taken based on individual aircraft noise performance data provided by the operators. This information will be centralised in a database and made available to competent authorities, airlines, air navigation service providers, airports and airport users.
Assessment of noise and information for residents
Competent authorities must ensure the regular monitoring of noise levels at airports for which they are responsible. If from their evaluation it emerges that operation restrictions could be a cost-effective measure to mitigate noise, a consultation process needs to be organised rapidly and interested parties have 3 months to submit their views before the adoption of restrictions.
Authorities must also ensure that information on operating restrictions is promptly and freely available to local residents and local authorities.
Phasing-out of noisy aircraft
Noise mitigation measures may include the withdrawal of, or extra restrictions upon, the noisier aircraft among those permitted by ICAO rules. Authorities will decide on the annual rate for reducing the number of movements by such aircraft for each operator at a given airport, up to a maximum of 25 %.
Regulation (EU) No 598/2014 repeals Directive 2002/30/EC with effect from 13 June 2016.

Summary 149:
More effective rules on insolvency proceedings across EU borders
More effective rules on insolvency proceedings across EU borders
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 — insolvency proceedings
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings involving an individual or business with business activities or financial interests in an European Union (EU) country other than the one in which they are usually based.
It recasts and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000.
KEY POINTS
The regulation sets out EU-wide rules to establish:which court has jurisdiction to open an insolvency case;the applicable national law;recognition of the court’s decision when a company, a trader or an individual becomes insolvent.
It does not apply to Denmark.
Applicable situations
The regulation applies to proceedings which include all or a significant part of a debtor’s creditors, are based on insolvency laws and in which, for the purpose of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganisation or liquidation:
1.a debtor has lost all or part of its assets and an insolvency specialist, such as a liquidator, has been appointed;
2.the assets and affairs of a debtor are under the control or supervision of a court; or
3.proceedings have been halted to allow for negotiations between the debtor and its creditors. This situation is only applicable if it takes place in the context of proceedings which aim at protecting the general body of creditors;the negotiations fail, in which case one of the 2 other types of proceedings listed above would follow.
The regulation covers ‘preventive’ insolvency proceedings available under national law which may be launched at an early stage in order to improve the chances of rescuing the business. These proceedings are listed in Annex A. It also covers a larger range of personal insolvency proceedings.
Jurisdiction
Proceedings take place in the courts of the EU country where the debtor’s main interests are centred. This is presumed to mean: the location of the registered office, in the case of a company or legal person;the principal place of business, in the case of an individual running a business or professional activity;where they usually live, in the case of any other individual.
These presumptions do not apply if the location has changed within a certain period prior to the start of insolvency proceedings.
If the debtor has a place of operation in an EU country other than the one where the debtor's main interests are centred, that EU country may also open insolvency proceedings against the debtor. However, these ‘secondary proceedings’ are limited to the assets held in that country.
The regulation improves the chances that companies will be rescued by avoiding the opening of parallel secondary proceedings, where interests of local creditors are otherwise guaranteed.
Applicable law
In general, the applicable law is that of the country in which the proceedings take place. That law governs the conditions for opening and closing the proceedings and their conduct. This includes determining:
the debtors against whom a case can be brought;
the assets which form part of the insolvency estate;
creditors’ rights after the case is closed;
who bears the costs and expenses of the proceedings.
Recognition and enforcement
Once a judgment opening insolvency proceedings in one EU country becomes effective, it must be recognised in all other EU countries with the same effect.
Insolvency registers
To better ensure creditors and courts receive relevant information and to prevent parallel proceedings being opened, EU countries are required to publish relevant information on cross-border insolvency cases in a publicly accessible online register. These registers will be interconnected via the European e-Justice portal, in line with EU data protection rules.
Group insolvency proceedings
The regulation creates a specific approach to deal with the insolvency of members of a group of companies. This includes:
rules requiring the various insolvency practitioners and the courts involved to cooperate and communicate with each other;
limited rights of standing for an insolvency practitioner in the proceedings concerning another member of the same group;
a specific system for the coordination of proceedings concerning the same company group (‘group coordination proceedings’).
Amendments to the Annexes
The regulation has been amended twice:
Regulation (EU) 2017/353 replaced Annex A (list of insolvency procedures) and Annex B (list of insolvency practitioners) to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking account of information provided by Poland.
Regulation (EU) 2018/946 replaces Annexes A and B following notifications of changes received from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia and Portugal.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 26 June 2017. Regulation (EU) 2015/848 revised and replaced Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 (and its subsequent amendments).

Liability of ship owners in the event of accidents
Liability of ship owners in the event of accidents
Passengers involved in maritime accidents must have an adequate level of compensation for any loss or damage they suffer. To ensure this, ship owners must have appropriate insurance arrangements in place.
ACT
                  
Regulation (EC) No 392/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
                     
It lays down harmonised rules on liability and insurance for shipping companies carrying passengers by sea. It introduces into European law the provisions of the 1974 Athens Convention on the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea and guidelines from the International Maritime Organisation.
KEY POINTS
The legislation applies to all ships flying an EU country flag, travelling to or from a European port, or under a European contract of carriage (i.e. a contract between the carrier and its passengers defining rights, duties and liabilities).
The legislation currently applies to both international and domestic voyages, but it does not apply to domestic voyages in the course of which the ship is less than 5 miles from the coastline.
The operators’ liability covers passengers and their luggage and vehicles, as well as mobility equipment for persons with reduced mobility.
For any injury or damage caused by a shipping incident (i.e. shipwreck, capsizing, collision or stranding, fire or explosion, or other defect of the ship), victims do not need to prove fault on the part of the carrier in order to be compensated.
Ship operators must make an advance payment to cover the immediate economic needs of a passenger who is killed or injured in a shipping incident. This payment does not imply the shipping company acknowledges liability.
The minimum advance payment for the death of a passenger is €21,000.
Shipping companies must provide passengers with understandable information on their rights.
This information must be available at all points of sale, including by phone and the internet, and provided before, or at the latest on, departure.
The European Commission, no later than 3 years after the legislation takes effect (31 December 2012), must produce a report on how it is being applied.
EU governments may postpone application of the legislation for ships involved in purely domestic voyages covered by the regulation. For vessels which travel less than 20 miles from the shore, the deadline is 31 December 2018 at the latest. For all others, the deadline is 31 December 2016.
SINCE WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
                     
From 29 May 2009.

A European rail network for competitive freight
A European rail network for competitive freight
This regulation sets out rules for the establishment and organisation of international rail corridors for competitive rail freight in order to develop a European rail network for competitive freight.
ACT
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 concerning a European rail network for competitive freight.
SUMMARY
This regulation aims to develop a European rail network for competitive freight by establishing rules for the creation and organisation of international rail corridors for competitive rail freight. The annex to this regulation, as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, sets out 9 initial freight corridors which must be made operational by the concerned European Union (EU) countries by November 2013, November 2015 or November 2020.
For each freight corridor, EU countries must establish an executive board, made up of representatives of the EU countries’ authorities. For each freight corridor, the infrastructure managers concerned must establish a management board, made up of representatives of the infrastructure managers. This management board shall draw up an implementation plan which includes an investment plan, the measures foreseen to implement the corridor and the main elements of a market study. It will also set up an advisory group composed of managers and owners of the terminals of the freight corridor and another advisory group composed of railway undertakings interested in the use of the freight corridor.
The management board shall jointly define and arrange international prearranged train paths for freight trains to offer journey times corresponding to the needs of the freight operators.
The management board will establish or designate a joint body to provide authorised applicants with a single place to both request and receive answers relating to infrastructure capacity for freight trains crossing at least one border along the freight corridor. This one-stop shop will take decisions regarding applications for pre-arranged train paths and the reserve capacity for international freight trains. Any applications which cannot be met by the one-stop shop will be forwarded to the competent infrastructure managers, who will take a decision on the application and communicate this decision to the one-stop shop for further processing.
Priority rules between the different types of traffic shall be drawn up for the cases of traffic disturbances.
A document containing all the relevant information concerning the use of the corridor shall be published. Regulatory bodies shall cooperate and exchange information, notably in case of complaints.

Road haulage and passenger transport companies: operating rules
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 setting common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator
Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 amending Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to adapt it to developments in the road transport sector
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009:
sets out rules for companies wanting to enter and be active in the road haulage (i.e. transport of goods by road) and passenger transport business;
applies to all companies established in the EU that are active in (or intending to be active in) transporting goods or people in exchange for payment.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 updates the rules for pursuing the occupation of road transport operator in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies* and unfair competition.
KEY POINTS
              
Companies active in the road transport operator business must:
be effectively and stably established in an EU country;
be of good repute;
have appropriate financial standing; and
have the required professional competence.
Transport manager
Every road transport company must designate a transport manager who is responsible for continuously managing its transport activities. This manager must reside in the EU and have a genuine link to the undertaking, for example as an employee, administrator or shareholder.
How to become a road transport operator
A company wanting to be active in the road transport operator business must be established in an EU country with premises in that EU country where it can keep all of the documents (accounts, personnel management documents and data relating to driving time and rest, etc.) required for its business.
The company should have at least one vehicle registered in that EU country at its disposal (once an authorisation has been granted) and have an operating centre situated in that country with the appropriate technical equipment and facilities for the operation of the vehicle(s).
In addition: neither the company nor the manager can have been convicted for any infringement of certain national and EU rules relating to road transport;the company must be able to meet its financial obligations;the manager must have passed a compulsory written examination, which may be supplemented by an oral examination.
Authorisation and monitoring
EU countries must designate one or more competent authorities responsible for: examining applications made by companies;granting permits to set up as a road transport operator;declaring a person to be fit/unfit to manage a company’s transport activities;checking that the company fulfils all the relevant requirements.
The competent authorities are also responsible for following up companies’ applications for registration within 3 months. In addition, they can declare a company unfit to manage transport activities.
Simplification and administrative cooperation
Each EU country must keep a national electronic register of companies authorised to be active in the road transport operator business. The competent national authorities are responsible for supervising the data in that register.
The national registers are to be interconnected, allowing the competent authorities of any EU country to consult the national electronic register of any other EU country.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055
The main changes introduced to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 by amending Regulation (EU) 2020/1055 include the following.
Replacing the article on conditions relating to the requirement of a transport undertaking being established (Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009) in order to combat the phenomenon of letterbox companies. It thus tightens the link between the transport operator’s place of establishment and its activities.
Extending the rules to cover vans used in international transport (light commercial vehicles weighing over 2.5 tonnes).
Requiring the European Commission to adopt implementing acts laying down a list of categories, types and degrees of gravity of serious infringements of EU rules.
Introducing new administrative procedures where a transport manager or a company has seriously infringed EU rules.
Introducing new rules concerning a haulier’s good repute: the minimum period after which transport managers who have lost their good repute can have it restored is 1 year. Managers who have lost their good repute must prove that they have followed a minimum level of training or passed an examination demonstrating knowledge of the subjects listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.
Revising Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 clarifying the most serious infringements.

Quarterly statistics on job vacancies in EU countries
Quarterly statistics on job vacancies in EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 453/2008 on quarterly statistics on job vacancies in the EU
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down the requirements for the regular quarterly production of statistics on job vacancies* in the European Union (EU).
These quarterly data are intended for short-term business cycle analysis (i.e. monitoring the fluctuations in business activity in an economy over a period of time).
KEY POINTS
Since 2010, each EU country must submit to the European Commission (Eurostat) data on job vacancies for businesses with 1 employee or more.
EU countries must transmit these data broken down by economic activity, within 70 days from the end of the quarter concerned.
Scope
The data cover all economic activities defined by the common classification system for economic activities in the EU’s NACE* in force, except for the activities of households as employers and the activities of overseas organisations and bodies.
Although covering agriculture, forestryand fishing activities , as defined by the NACE in force, is optional, EU countries wishing to provide data for those sectors must do so in accordance with this regulation.
Owing to the growing importance of personal care services (residential care activities and social work activities without accommodation) for job creation, EU countries are also requested to transmit, on an optional basis, data on job vacancies in these areas. The data must be broken down by economic activity in accordance with the NACE in force at section level.
Data are collected in the EU countries, Norway, Switzerland and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Reference dates and specifications
EU countries must compile the quarterly data with reference to specific reference dates. These are determined by the European Statistical System Committee, made up of national experts, which assists and is chaired by the European Commission.
Countries must also provide data on occupied posts in order to standardise job vacancy data for comparative purposes. They must apply seasonal adjustments to the quarterly job vacancy data.
Data transmission
EU countries must transmit data to Eurostat in a format and within deadlines determined by the European Statistical System Committee.
Quality assessment
On receipt of the data from EU countries, Eurostat checks them for completeness and consistency.
Financing
EU countries were able to receive EU funding for the first three years of data collection as a contribution to the cost of the work involved.
Reports
Every 3 years, the Commission submits a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the regulation. This assesses the quality of the statistics provided by EU countries and that of European aggregates, as well as identifying potential areas for improvement.
Implementing acts
Regulation (EC) No 1062/2008 sets out the procedures for seasonal adjustment of data and for quality reports.
Regulation (EC) No 19/2009 defines a job vacancy, the reference dates for data collection, data transmission specifications and feasibility studies.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 24 June 2008.
BACKGROUND
              
EU policies in the area of job vacancies aim to improve the functioning of the labour market by trying to more closely match supply and demand. EURES, the European job mobility portal, seeks to make it easier to match jobseekers and employers.
For more information, see:
‘Job vacancy statistics’ on Eurostat's website

Natural gas transmission networks
Natural gas transmission networks
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It lays down rules for access to:
natural gas transmission* networks;
gas storage; and
liquefied natural gas facilities.
These rules aim to counteract barriers to competition in the EU’s market for natural gas and to ensure its smooth operation.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation determines:
how tariffs (solely for access to networks) are set;
the services to be offered;
the allocation of capacity to gas transmission system operators (TSOs)*;
transparency requirements (such as rules on publishing how they arrive at their tariffs and their tariff structure); and
balancing* rules and imbalance charges on the market.
Certification of transmission system operators
National regulatory authorities (NRAs) must notify the European Commission of decisions relating to certifying a TSO. The Commission has 2 months to deliver its opinion to an NRA . The authority then adopts the final decision concerning the TSO’s certification. This decision and the Commission’s opinion are published.
Creation of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG)
The gas TSOs had to submit to the Commission and to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) the draft statutes for the ENTSOG, a list of members and draft rules of procedure by 3 March 2011.
Tasks of the ENTSOG concerning network codes
The Commission must consult ACER and the ENTSOG in order to establish an annual list of the priorities for developing sets of rules (known as network codes). These codes are developed using a non-binding guideline submitted to the Commission by ACER. The codes relate in particular to:
capacity allocation and congestion management rules;
interoperability rules between transmission system operators;
balancing rules;
transparency of rules;
harmonised transmission tariff structures.
Tasks of the ENTSOG
The ENTSOG is responsible for adopting:
common network operation tools;
a 10-year network development plan;
recommendations for coordinated technical cooperation between EU TSOs;
an annual work programme;
an annual report;
annual summer and winter supply outlooks.
Costs and tariffs
The regulatory authorities determine tariffs or methodologies for their calculation. EU countries may take decisions relating to tariffs such as fixing auction arrangements.
Third-party access services
TSOs must offer their services in a non-discriminatory manner to all network users.Detailed allocation rules are established in the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanism.
Liquefied natural gas and storage facility operators must also offer their services on a non-discriminatory basis and make them compatible with the use of interconnected gas transport networks. EU countries may decide whether access for storage is to be regulated or negotiated.
Congestion management
All market participants must have access to maximum network capacity as well as to storage and LNG facilities.
TSOs must practise and publish transparent congestion-management* procedures which ensure that cross-border exchanges in gas are on a non-discriminatory basis.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 3 March 2011. It repealed Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 from 3 March 2011.
BACKGROUND
              
For more information, see:
Market legislation (European Commission)
European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas — ENTSOG (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Transmission: transport of gas from production areas to end consumers by underground pipelines.
Transmission system operator (TSO): a body that transports energy, such as natural gas, either nationally or regionally, using fixed infrastructure.
Balancing: making receipts and deliveries of gas into or withdrawals from a company equal. Balancing may be accomplished daily, monthly or seasonally, with penalties generally assessed for excessive imbalance.
Congestion management: congestion arises when the transmission system is not sufficient to transfer the power according to market desires. Congestion management ensures the use of the power available without violating the system constraints.

Civil judicial cooperation and agreements with non-EU countries
Civil judicial cooperation and agreements with non-EU countries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 662/2009 — negotiation and conclusion of agreements between EU and non-EU countries in regard to the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It aims at ensuring coherence in the EU’s external action in an area now falling within the exclusive competence of the EU.
It establishes a procedure of authorisation for an EU country to amend an existing agreement or –– to negotiate and conclude a new agreement with a non-EU country related to specific matters of applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations*. The procedure is subject to strict rules and has to be considered exceptional.
KEY POINTS
              
Scope: the regulation applies to agreements concerning particular matters falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II).
Notification: where an EU country intends to enter into negotiations in order to amend an existing agreement or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of the regulation, it must notify the European Commission in writing of its intention as soon as possible before the envisaged opening of formal negotiations.
Confidentiality: the Commission has to treat the information communicated by the EU country as confidential, if so requested.
Assessment: the Commission must:
firstly, check that no relevant negotiating mandate for concluding an EU-level agreement with the non-EU country concerned is envisaged within the next 24 months;
if not, verify that there is a genuine specific interest of the EU country for the agreement and that the envisaged agreement would not undermine the effectiveness of EU law and the object and purpose of the EU external relations policy; and
if necessary, request further information.
Authorisation of negotiations: if the conditions are met, the Commission authorises the EU country to open formal negotiations on the agreement. The Commission may propose negotiating guidelines as well as the inclusion of particular clauses in the envisaged agreement.
Participation: the Commission may participate as an observer in the negotiations, and otherwise should be kept informed of progress and results.
Clauses in the agreement: where is is authorised, the agreement will in any case have to stipulate
that the agreement is fully or partially terminated in the event of a subsequent agreement between the EU and the same non-EU country on the same subject matter; and
that a subsequent agreement between the EU and the non-EU country on the same subject matter direct replace the relevant clauses of the agreement.
Authorisation of conclusion: before signing the agreement, the EU country must notify the outcome of the negotiations and submit the text of the agreement to the Commission, for authorisation of conclusion after verifying that the conditions are met.
Refusal: the regulation sets out the procedure for and consequences of the Commission’s refusal to authorise negotiations or the conclusion of the agreement.
Review and expiry
The regulation expires 3 years after the submission by the Commission — no earlier than 7 July 2017 — of a report on its application. In that report, the Commission must indicate whether it recommends that this regulation be replaced at its expiry by a new regulation.
Any negotiation underway at the date of expiry may continue.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 20 August 2009.
BACKGROUND
              
This regulation should be seen in the context of the EU’s exclusive external competence for these areas of civil law. Before the adoption of the relevant internal EU Regulations (Rome I and Rome II), the EU countries themselves concluded agreements with non-EU countries in this area.
As part of the EU approach to judicial cooperation and agreements with non-EU countries in civil matters, this regulation comes along with Regulation (EC) No 664/2009 concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations which entered into force the same day and is based on a similar procedure.
For more information, see:
Civil and commercial matters (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Non-contractual obligation: where a person who is responsible for loss sustained by another person outside the performance of a contract – e.g. due to a tort or by unjust enrichment – is required to compensate the loss.

SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 — EU statistics on migration and international protection
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 sets out EU rules for collecting and compiling statistics on migration (emigration* and immigration*), international protection (asylum), regular and irregular migration* and returns by EU and EFTA countries.
To ensure reliable, relevant and timely statistics are available in the area of migration and international protection, and to support the European Agenda on Migration, amending Regulation (EU) 2020/851 introduces additional statistics to be collected by Eurostat and adds rules for introducing pilot studies to test the feasibility of new data collections or disaggregations within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007.
KEY POINTS
              
Statistical requirementsThe regulation sets out the statistical requirements for different categories of data:
For international migration, EU countries must provide Eurostat with statistics on: immigrants moving to their territories;emigrants moving from their territories;persons usually resident on their territories;persons having acquired national citizenship.
For residence permits and residence of non-EU citizens, EU countries must provide Eurostat with statistics on: residence permits issued, permits issued due to the change of immigration status or reason to stay; and long-term residence permits issued;the numbers of valid residence permits and long-term residence permits.
For international protection, EU countries must provide Eurostat with statistics on: persons applying for international protection including first-time and subsequent applications;unaccompanied children applying for international protection;pending applications for international protection;withdrawn asylum applications;applications processed under accelerated procedure;applicants benefiting from material reception conditions;rejected applications for international protection;grants of refugee, subsidiary protection, national humanitarian and temporary protection statuses;requests and re-examination requests, decisions and transfers under the Dublin III Regulation;beneficiaries of resettlement*.
For the prevention of irregular entry and stay, and for returns, EU countries must provide statistics on the number of: non-EU citizens who have been refused entry at their external borders;non-EU citizens who have been found illegally present on their territories;administrative or judicial decisions imposing an obligation to leave their territories;the number of non-EU citizens who are returned having been given an order to leave.
Data sources
The statistics are based on a number of sources including:
records of administrative and judicial actions;
registers of the population or relating to administrative actions;
censuses;
sample surveys.
In general, the statistics are broken down by age, sex and citizenship. However, data are also collected for other categories such as the reason for issuing a residence permit or country of birth and country of previous or next residence for migration data.
Pilot studies
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/851 introduces pilot studies to test the feasibility of new data collections or disaggregations within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007.
Financial contributions from the EU budget are available for national institutes to:
develop new methodologies for statistics on migration and international protection; and
develop or implement new data collections and disaggregations, including the upgrading of data sources and IT systems, for a period of up to 5 years.
Implementation
The European Commission submits a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the regulation every 3 years. The 2018 report found clear improvements in data availability, completeness, quality and timeliness.

Rules for statutory audit of public-interest entities
Rules for statutory audit of public-interest entities
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to improve transparency in the audit market to strengthen public confidence in the annual and consolidated financial statements of public-interest entities (PIEs)*.
It does so by laying down rules on: audits of public-interest entities;organisation and selection of statutory auditors and audit firms to guarantee their independence and avoid conflicts of interest;supervision of statutory auditors and audit firms.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation sets out:
Conditions for carrying out statutory audit of public interest entities, notably:
Fee structures:
payments for permitted non-audit services, if supplied for 3 or more consecutive years, should be limited to a maximum of 70% of the average of the statutory audit fees paid in the previous 3 years;
statutory auditors or firms must declare to the audit committee* if they receive from a single PIE more than 15% of their total income 3 years running to determine whether this is a threat to their independence and if safeguards are in place.
Ban on non-audit services:
auditors carrying out a statutory audit of a PIE may not provide a wide range of non-audit activities, such as tax and legal advice or preparation of accounts, to the company, or parent or subsidiaries, while conducting the audit or during the previous financial year;
EU governments may relax some of the restrictions or ban other services depending on their impact on an auditor’s independence;
auditors carrying out a statutory audit may provide non-audit services which are not specifically banned subject to the approval of the audit committee.
Preparation for statutory audits: auditors, before accepting or continuing an engagement for a statutory audit of a PIE: must ensure the independence requirements are met;confirm annually in writing to the audit committee that the firm, partners and senior managers are independent from the PIE;discuss with the audit committee any threats to their independence and the safeguards applied.
Irregularities:
Auditors must: inform the company if they suspect financial irregularities or fraud have taken place and ask it to take the necessary action. If it fails to do so, they inform the appropriate authorities;report promptly to the appropriate authorities if, during an audit, they uncover illegal behaviour, a threat or doubt about the PIE’s viability or decide to refuse to issue an audit opinion or to deliver an adverse or qualified one.
Audit reports:
statutory auditors produce an audit report and an additional report to the audit committee. Each is subject to a quality control review before publication;
the audit report, drafted in clear and unambiguous language, describes, among other things, the most significant risks identified and the auditor’s response to them and key observations;
the additional report provides more detailed information, such as scope and timing of the audit and methodology used, for the audit committee.
Additional requirements for statutory auditors:
publication of an annual transparency report, available on its website for at least 5 years, containing detailed information about the company and its activities;
submission annually to the relevant authority of income from PIEs broken down by revenue from statutory audit and various non-audit services;
retention for at least 5 years of documents and information specified in the regulation.
Appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities
a general meeting of shareholders or members of the PIE appoint the auditor on the basis of a recommendation from the audit committee. This contains at least 2 choices and explains why one is preferred;
a PIE is free to invite any auditor or firm to submit proposals and the tender should not exclude small firms which received less than 15% of their total audit fees from PIEs the previous calendar year;
a PIE appoints an auditor initially for 1 year and a maximum of 10 years. This can be raised to 20 years for a public tendering process and 24 years where a company is audited by at least 2 audit firms;
a gap of 4 years must occur before an auditor can audit the same company again;
auditors provide a hand-over file containing all relevant information and the most recent audit to their successor.
Surveillance of statutory auditors and audit firms
EU governments appoint an authority to supervise auditors and firms carrying out statutory audits of PIEs. The authorities: are independent of statutory auditors and audit firms;respect professional secrecy;may not interfere with the content of audit reports;have the necessary supervisory and investigative powers, including accessing data and inspecting firms, either on their own, working with other authorities or help of the judiciary;establish and implement an effective system of audit quality assurance;follow clear rules on the appointment of inspectors and their activities;monitor the market for the provision of statutory audit services to PIEs, especially the performance of audit committees, market concentration in specific sectors or any failings by firms;publish a report by 17/6/2016, and every 3 years thereafter, on market developments (based on these reports, the European Commission will publish a joint report on these developments at the EU level);publish annual activity reports, work programmes and assessments of the quality assurance system;cooperate with their counterparts in other EU countries, particularly on quality assurance reviews, investigations and on-site inspections;may exchange information with colleagues in non-EU countries subject to certain conditions.
The regulation establishes the Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB). This: contains one senior representative from each national authority and one from the European Securities and Markets Authority;provides advice to the European Commission and national authorities, contributes technical expertise, plays a coordinating role and encourages exchange of information, expertise and best practice;may establish permanent or ad hoc sub-groups on specific issues.
Transitional measures
From 17 June 2020, a PIE may not renew a contract with a statutory auditor or audit firm if the latter has been providing it with audit services for 20 or more consecutive years when the regulation came into force;
From 17 June 2023, the same restriction applies if the services have been provided for between 11 and 20 consecutive years.
The regulation repeals Commission Decision 2005/909/EC.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 17 June 2016.
BACKGROUND
The regulation complements Directive 2006/43/EC which applies to all statutory audits (see summary) with regard to public-interest entities.
In 2017, the Commission published a report on monitoring developments in the EU market for providing statutory audit services to public-interest entities
In addition to increasing transparency in the audit market, the regulation encourages a wider choice of audit providers in an area highly concentrated in a few big accounting firms.
For more information, see: Regulation on statutory audit of public-interest entities (Audit regulation) (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Public-interest entity: companies with a significant public interest because of the nature of their business, size or number of employees or corporate status, including banks, insurance firms and listed companies.
Audit committee: each PIE has an audit committee of non-executive members or members of its supervisory body.

Summary 161:
The EU’s common fisheries policy
The EU’s common fisheries policy
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the common fisheries policy
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
The regulation includes the basic rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP) in the European Union (EU).
The CFP aims to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities contribute to long-term environmental, economic and social sustainability. In line with the European Green Deal (see summary) and the biodiversity strategy 2030 (see summary), EU fisheries are governed by the precautionary principle in order to limit the impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem.
The CFP builds on four pillars: fisheries management;international policy;market and trade policy; andfinancial support, i.e. the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (see summary).
The CFP establishes rules for the management of fisheries, thus contributing to the conservation of marine biological resources, increased productivity, a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector, stable markets and the availability of food supplies at reasonable prices. Regarding market measures and financial support, the CFP also covers freshwater biological resources and aquaculture activities, along with the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products.
KEY POINTS
Fisheries management aims to enable fishers to maximise their catches without threatening the reproduction of fish stocks (their ‘maximum sustainable yield’*. To this end, total allowable catches (or ‘fishing opportunities’) are set for most commercial fish stocks. Fishing levels had to conform to maximum sustainable yield levels for all stocks by 2015, if possible, and no later than 2020.
The management of fish stocks is based on scientific advice. EU Member States must collect, manage and make available the data needed for scientific advice. This includes biological, environmental and socioeconomic data. Data collection activities are financially supported by the EU.
By introducing a landing obligation*, the CFP aims to end the wasteful practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea (discarding). The landing obligation was gradually phased in over the 2015–2019 period and is now fully in force, requiring fishers to land all catches of regulated commercial species.
Multiannual plans set targets for the management of fish stocks. Where the adoption of multiannual plans or management plans that include discard plans takes longer than envisaged, Regulation (EU) 2017/2092 (amending Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013) empowers the European Commission to adopt discard plans.
Technical measures are a broad set of rules that govern how, where and when fishers may fish. They are established for all European sea basins, but they differ considerably from one sea basin to another, reflecting regional circumstances.
The CFP decentralises decision-making by bringing it closer to the fishing grounds (a process known as regionalisation). It provides for the establishment of advisory councils for each of the geographical areas. Member States with a management interest in a given area can propose detailed measures, which the Commission can adopt into EU law.
A fisheries control system ensures compliance with the CFP rules, including the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 – see summary). Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 (see summary) lays down the rules that apply to conserving fish stocks in countries with unsustainable fishing.
New marketing standards with respect to labelling, quality and traceability allow consumers to be better informed about the origin of the fish they buy and its mode of production.
The sustainability principle also applies to EU vessels fishing outside EU waters. The Commission is granted the power to negotiate and conclude sustainable fisheries partnership agreements on behalf of the EU with certain non-EU partner countries. These agreements: allow EU vessels to fish for surplus stocks in the partner country’s exclusive economic zone* in a legally regulated environment in return for a financial contribution;focus on resource conservation and environmental sustainability, ensuring that all EU vessels are subject to the same rules of control and transparency.
Member States must support the development of sustainable aquaculture through multiannual national plans.
Review of the reformed CFP
Every year, the Commission publishes a communication outlining progress on the situation of fish stocks and launching a wide public consultation on the fixing of annual fishing opportunities for the following year. This communication assesses the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sector’s socio-economic performance and the implementation of the landing obligation. It also sets out the rationale for the proposal on fishing opportunities for the following year.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
The CFP was first launched in 1970. It has undergone several reforms, the most recent of which took effect on 1 January 2014.
For further information, see: Common fisheries policy (CFP) (European Commission).
KEY TERMS
              
Maximum sustainable yield. The highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken on average from a stock under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process.
Landing obligation. The requirement for EU vessels to land all catches to end the wasteful practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea.

Summary 162:
EU market for fishery and aquaculture products
EU market for fishery and aquaculture products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 — common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
As part of the reform of the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP), the regulation revises the aims and regulation of the common organisation of the markets of fishery and aquaculture (fish and shellfish farming) products.
KEY POINTS
              
The scheme covers 5 main areas:
professional organisations;
marketing standards;
consumer information;
competition rules;
market intelligence (collecting and analysing relevant market data to use as a basis for decision-making).
Professional organisations
The regulation sets out a number of specific aims for producer organisations including promoting sustainable fishing and reducing discards.
The reform also focuses on the collective management of activities through production and marketing plans. The rules and structure of these plans are set out in a subsequent implementing regulation, and the European Commission has set out recommendations to facilitate the role of competent national authorities in this respect.
Rules on the recognition of producer organisations and inter-branch organisations are set out in the text and in a further implementing regulation.
Marketing standards
Common marketing standards are established for fishery products regardless of whether their origin is from within or outside of the EU. Those fishery products that do not comply with these standards may still be used for purposes other than direct human consumption (for example, petfood, cosmetics).
Consumer information
Labelling for consumers must indicate:
the commercial name of the species (the name or names accepted or permitted locally or regionally in a country) and its scientific name;
the production method;
where the product was caught or farmed and the type of fishing gear used;
whether the product has been defrosted;
the expiry date, where appropriate.
Competition rules
The common organisation of the markets is subject to EU competition rules, but there are certain exceptions to ensure the proper functioning of the policy and the achievement of EU objectives (e.g. adjustment of members’ level of production).
Market intelligence
The Commission is to provide market intelligence for professional organisations, stakeholders and policymakers through the dissemination of economic knowledge, market analysis and price monitoring.
COVID-19 pandemic — amendment to the regulation
Regulation (EU) 2020/560 amends Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 introducing specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a significant drop in demand for fishery and aquaculture products following the COVID-19 pandemic with serious socio-economic consequences in those communities where fishing and aquaculture play a major role.
The amended regulation aims to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each EU country and to simplify the procedure for amending operational programmes when introducing new measures.
Given the important role of producer organisations in managing the crisis, the ceiling for financial support to production and marketing plans is substantially increased and EU countries are allowed to grant advances of up to 100% of that financial support. In addition, the possibility to use the storage aid mechanism was extended to aquaculture producer organisations,
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
              
This regulation is the second of 3 elements in the legislative package of CFP reform. It accompanies Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the CFP (see summary) and Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 on the European and Maritime Fisheries Fund (see summary).

Summary 163:
Improving securities settlement in the EU
Improving securities settlement in the EU
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to harmonise the timing and conduct of securities settlement in the European Union (EU) and the rules applicable to central securities depositories (CSDs)*.
It is designed to increase the safety and efficiency of the system, particularly for transactions within the EU.
KEY POINTS
The regulation notably introduces the following elements. Shorter settlement periods, which should in general take place no later than the second business day after the trading occurs.An obligation to record in book-entry form* all transferable securities admitted to trading or traded on the trading venues.Strict organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements for CSDs.A settlement discipline regime to deal with settlement failures. CSDs must operate a cash penalties system and are subject to reporting requirements regarding settlement failures. Participants are subject to mandatory buy-ins.A passport system allowing authorised CSDs to provide their services across the EU, subject to certain passporting requirements.Increased prudential and supervisory requirements for CSDs and other institutions providing banking-type services that support securities settlement.
EU Member States’ national authorities: authorise and supervise CSDs, and review and evaluate them on an annual basis at least;exchange information and cooperate with each other and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
CSDs must notably: have robust governance arrangements, a clear organisational structure, internal controls and sound administrative and accounting procedures;ensure senior management is of sufficiently good repute and experience;establish user committees for each securities settlement system they operate;maintain for at least 10 years all records of their services and activities;remain fully responsible for any work they outsource;display transparency by publicly disclosing the prices and fees involved in the core services they provide;have sufficient capital to be adequately protected against operational, legal, custody, investment and business risks;secure additional authorisations before providing any banking-type ancillary services.
CSDs in a non-EU country may operate in the EU, including through an EU-based branch, provided they meet certain requirements.
ESMA maintains a publicly available register of each authorised CSD.
Member States’ competent authorities have the power to apply appropriate administrative sanctions and other measures for an infringement.
Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014
To have a clear and coherent legislative framework for trading and settlement, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 relies on many of the definitions and concepts of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II – see summary). Regulation (EU) 2016/1033 amends Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to take into account the change in the date of application of MiFID II. To ensure legal certainty for the period between the previous date of application and the new date of application of MiFID II, Regulation (EU) 2016/1033 amends Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 clarifying that the rules set out in MiFID I (Directive 2004/39/EC) apply until the new date of entry into application of MiFID II.
The European Commission has also adopted several delegated acts supplementing Regulation (EU) No 909/2014: Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389 regarding the parameters for the calculation of cash penalties for settlement fails and the operations of CSDs in host Member States;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/390 with regard to regulatory technical standards on certain prudential requirements for central securities depositories and designated credit institutions offering banking-type ancillary services;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/391 with regard to regulatory technical standards further specifying the content of the reporting on internalised settlements;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/392 with regard to regulatory technical standards on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for central securities depositories;Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1229 with regard to regulatory technical standards on settlement discipline, which has in turn been amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1212 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/70.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
Book-entry form requirements (Article 3(1)) apply from 1 January 2023 to transferable securities issued after that date and from 1 January 2025 to all transferable securities.
The regulation’s settlement date rules (Article 5(2)) have applied since 1 January 2015.
The settlement discipline regime (Articles 6(1) to (4) and 7(1) to (13)) applies from 1 February 2022.
BACKGROUND
Traditionally, CSDs have been regulated nationally.
Settlement across borders presents higher risks and costs for investors than domestic operations. At the same time, this form of transaction is increasing.
The main objective of the regulation is to increase the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures in the EU. It does this by providing a common set of prudential, organisational and conduct of business standards for use across the EU, which should play a crucial role in financing the economy.
For further information, see: Central securities depositories (CSDs) (European Commission)Settlement (European Securities and Markets Authority).
KEY TERMS
              
Central securities depositories. A legal person that operates a securities settlement system and provides at least services for the initial recording of securities in a book-entry system and/or for the provision and maintenance of securities accounts at top tier level.
Book entry. Where the ownership of a security is recorded in electronic form rather than in certificate form.

European Regional Development Fund (2014-2020)
European Regional Development Fund (2014-2020)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 on the European Regional Development Fund and on specific rules about the investment for growth and jobs goal
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets up the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the period 2014-2020. The ERDF aims to promote the EU’s harmonious, balanced and sustainable development by correcting some of the differences in levels of development between its regions.
The regulation has been amended three times by: amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — the EU’s financial regulation (see summary) which sets out the rules for drawing up and implementing the EU budget; andamending Regulation (EU) 2020/460, adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, which contains specific measures to mobilise investments in EU countries’ healthcare systems and in other sectors of their economies (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative), andamending Regulation (EU) 2020/558, adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, and containing exceptional flexibility for the use of the European Structural and Investments Funds (ESI Funds).
KEY POINTS
Eligibility
All regions in EU countries are eligible but the aid granted depends on EU priorities and the type of region.
Key themes
The ERDF concentrates its investments on 4 key themes:
innovation and research;
information and communication technologies (ICT);
support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);
promoting a low-carbon economy.
Types of investment
in SMEs to create and safeguard sustainable jobs,
in all types of enterprise in the fields of innovation and research, the low-carbon economy, as well as ICT where SMEs are involved,
in infrastructure providing basic services in energy, environment, transport, and ICT, but also in social, health and educational infrastructure,
working capital in SMEs where necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a public health crisis (following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), and
in the development of endogenous potential.
Overall budget
The budget for 2014-2020 is over €185 billion.
Policy and budget priorities
The 4 key themes listed above are very significant for the allocation of ERDF funding which varies depending on the category of region.
The regions are defined in terms of their GDP expressed as a percentage of an EU average: more developed regions: GDP more than 90%transition regions: GDP 75%-90%less developed regions: GDP less than 75%
In more developed regions, (transition regions), (less developed regions), at least 80% (60%) (50%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be allocated to 2 or more of the 4 key themes, namely innovation and research, SMEs, ICT and a low-carbon economy; because of its importance, at least 20% (15%) (12%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be channelled specifically towards low-carbon economy projects.
A minimum of 5% of ERDF funding is earmarked for sustainable urban development. An urban development network is to be set up at EU level to promote networking and exchange of experience on sustainable urban development.
Implementation
ERDF is implemented at national level by means of 7-year programmes as part of a Partnership Agreement between the EU country and the EU which involves the 5 European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds): ERDF,European Social Fund (ESF),Cohesion Fund,European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) andEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
This agreement is prepared by each EU country with the involvement of partners representing regional and local public authorities, as well as a wide range of social, economic, environmental and other interests.
Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative
The Coronavirus Investment Initiative, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2020/460, offers EU countries access to €37 billion from the ESI Funds to strengthen health systems and support small and medium-sized enterprises, short-time working schemes and community-based services.
Coronavirus special measures: more flexibility in the use of ESI fund
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/558 allows EU countries to transfer resources between the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, between the different categories of regions and between the 3 funds’ specific priority areas.
From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, cohesion policy programmes related to COVID-19 can be financed exceptionally through 100% EU funding during the accounting year. The measures also simplify programme approval to speed up implementation, make financial instruments easier to use and simplify audits.

European territorial cooperation (ETC) is a core objective of EU regional policy and is financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The regulation describes the background and general principles of ETC and specifies the scope of the ERDF in achieving the objectives of territorial cooperation for the period 2014-20.
The aim of ETC is to encourage regions and cities from different EU countries to work together and learn from each other through joint programmes, projects and networks.
ETC programmes come in 3 types:
—
cross-border cooperation: financing joint projects implemented directly at EU borders, for example between neighbouring land or maritime border-regions, or a region in at least one EU country and non-EU country on the external borders of the EU. These regions in non-EU countries must not be covered by programmes under the EU's external financial instruments;
—
transnational cooperation programmes: involve national, regional and local partners over larger areas of cooperation, such as the Baltic Sea Region;
—
interregional cooperation: all EU countries are eligible to participate in projects of this type. It includes projects and networks for the exchange of experience and good practice between regional and local bodies in different countries. These projects aim to ensure that cohesion policy resources are applied effectively.
Management of programmes
As ETC programmes consist of a group of EU countries and sometimes non-EU countries, they are managed by a body jointly designated by the participating countries.
Reporting
Regulation (EU) 2015/207 lays down the detailed rules that managing authorities need to follow for drawing up the annual and final implementation reports.
Budget
The budget within the ERDF for ETC is €8.9 billion over the 2014-20 period. The contribution to the 3 main types of programme is broken down as follows:
—
cross-border cooperation: €6.6 billion;
—
transnational cooperation: €1.8 billion;
—
interregional cooperation: €500 million.
List of cooperation programmes
Commission Implementing Decision 2014/366/EU sets out the list of cooperation programmes and the amount of ERDF support for each programme.
BACKGROUND
The ERDF is 1 of 5 European Structural and Investment Funds that work together to support economic, social and territorial cohesion and deliver the objectives of the EU's Europe 2020 strategy to generate smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

Guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure
Guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure
This EU regulation lays down guidelines to develop priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure in a timely fashion.
SUMMARY
            
In April 2013, the EU guidelines for the development of European energy infrastructure were approved.
One of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is sustainable growth to be achieved by promoting a more resource-efficient, more sustainable and more competitive economy. That strategy put energy infrastructure at the forefront of this effort by underlining the need to urgently upgrade Europe’s networks, interconnecting them at the continental level, in particular to integrate renewable energy sources.
The essential background to this is that EU Member States agreed in 2011 that:
Europe’s energy infrastructure needs to be modernised and expanded;
networks across borders need to be interconnected;
there is a need to provide for alternative supply or transit routes;
there is a need for alternative sources of energy, including renewables;
no EU country should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections.
The guidelines established 12 regional groups for trans-European energy infrastructure (TEN-E), which selected projects.
In October 2013, the Commission adopted a list of 248 key energy infrastructure projects (projects of common interest), which will benefit from faster and more efficient permit granting procedures and improved regulatory treatment.
The projects may also have access to financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility(CEF), under which almost EUR 6 billion has been allocated to TEN-E up to 2020.
For a project to be included in the list, it has to:
have significant benefits for at leasttwoEU Member States ;
contribute to market integration and further competition;
enhance security of supply;
reduce CO2emissions.
A new EU list will be established every 2 years.
The guidelines state that projects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum.
It adds that the Commission should nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties.
ACT
            
Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009

Summary 168:
Solving consumer–trader disputes arising from online shopping
Solving consumer–trader disputes arising from online shopping
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It aims to create an online dispute resolution (ODR) platform (website) at EU level.
Consumers and traders will be able to use the platform to resolve disputes when they have a problem with a product or service that they have bought anywhere in the European Union (EU).
KEY POINTS
              
The complaint procedure involves both parties and the mediationbody (alternative dispute resolution (ADR)) they agree to use. These bodies — some of which operate online — offer a neutral party such as an ombudsman or mediator. Their job is to propose or impose a solution or to bring the parties together so they can find a solution.
The entire procedure can be handled quickly online, so most disputes should be settled within 90 days.
ODR platform
The European Commission will develop, operate and maintain the ODR platform. It will be launched in January 2016 and will be:
an interactive and user-friendly website;
open to any customer or trader in the EU;
available in all EU official languages;
free of charge.
The platform has several functions. These include offering an electronic complaint form, informing the respondent party about the complaint, identifying national mediation bodies and electronic case management.
Each EU country must designate one ODR contact point, hosting at least two ODR advisers. The Commission will also set up a network of ODR contact points.
Once the electronic complaint form has been submitted to the ODR platform, the platform will quickly contact and seek a response from the respondent party. It will also transmit the complaint to the mediation body that the parties agree to use. If the mediation body agrees to deal with the dispute, it will strive to resolve the dispute quickly and inform the ODR platform of the results of the procedure.
Alternative dispute resolution
The ODR platform can be accessed through the Your Europe portal. It will also be connected to all the national mediation bodies that have been set up and notified to the European Commission, in line with the EU alternative dispute resolution (ADR) directive.
The ODR regulation and ADR directive were both adopted in May 2013.
The ODR platform is accessible to consumers and traders since 15 February 2016.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 9 January 2016.

Rules for direct EU payments to farmers
Rules for direct EU payments to farmers
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 — rules for direct payments to farmers under the EU’s common agricultural policy
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for direct payments made to support farmers under the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP). These payments are made in full on the condition that farmers meet basic standards concerning the environment, climate change, good agricultural and environmental condition of land, public health, animal health, plant health and animal welfare — known as cross-compliance. Rules on cross-compliance are laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 (see summary).
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, which contained the previous rules governing direct payments to farmers that changed following the reform of the CAP in 2013. It also repeals Regulation (EC) No 637/2008, which related to the cotton sector.
In 2017, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/2393, which amends Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 and other legislation relating to the CAP: Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 setting up the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development,Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 laying down financing, managing and monitoring rules for the EU agricultural policy,Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 on the common organisation of agricultural markets in the EU, andRegulation (EU) No 652/2014 on the management of expenditure relating to the food chain, animal health and animal welfare.
In 2020, the EU adopted amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220, which lays down certain transitional rules for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the years 2021 and 2022.
KEY POINTS
              
Direct payments to farmers are paid through support schemes in each EU country.
EU countries must dedicate a certain proportion of their CAP funding allocation to compulsory support schemes, as described below.
Standard per-hectare payments. To distribute support more fairly, all EU countries had to move towards a uniform payment per hectare from 2015 (a ‘basic payment for farmers’).
Green payments per hectare. To be granted to farmers for observing practices beneficial for the climate and the environment (30% of national funding allocation).
Young farmer per-hectare payment. For farmers no more than 40 years old, setting up for the first time as head of their farm, up to 5 years before claiming support; this payment is available for up to 5 years.
There are also some optional support schemes. EU countries can choose to:
support smaller farms by paying a higher amount on the first hectares (‘redistributive payment’);
grant additional payments for areas with natural constraints;
grant limited amounts of production-related support ('coupled support' — payments linked to specific crops or types of livestock) to help agricultural sectors in their own country that are in difficulty;
offer a simplified scheme for small farmers — an annual payment of up to €1,250.
From 1 January 2018, the new rules contained in amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 came into force and include the following.
In principle, only active farmers (meaning those whose agricultural activity is not insignificant) could be granted direct support. However, in some EU countries, the administration became too burdensome. In particular, claimants operating airports, railway services, waterworks, real-estate services and permanent sport and recreational grounds were considered inactive except if they proved otherwise. The application of that clause has become voluntary for EU countries.
Some aspects of the rules applying to green payments have been simplified, especially for crop-diversification requirements.
An extension of the permanent grassland definition: EU countries may decide to include certain shrubs or trees that produce animal feed in permanent grassland where grasses and other herbaceous forage remain predominant, in the whole or part of their territory;they may consider land not ploughed up or used for crop rotation for 5 years or more as a criterion for the classification of permanent grassland.
Young farmers are able to more easily access all 5 years of payments.
EU countries’ responsibilities in regard to the production-limiting nature of coupled support are clarified.
The types of areas of ecological interest for green payments (ecological focus areas) are extended to cover areas on which plant varieties such as Miscanthus and Silphium perfoliatum are grown, and also to land lying fallow for plants that are beneficial for pollinators.
Transitional rules for the years 2021 and 2022
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220, adopted in December 2020, allows for the continued application of the rules under the 2014-2020 CAP framework and ensures the continuity of payments to farmers and other beneficiaries of support from the EAGF and the EAFRD in 2021 and 2022, until the date of application of the new framework. The aim of the transitional period is to facilitate a smooth transition for beneficiaries to a new programming period.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 has applied since 1 January 2015.
The rules introduced by amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 have applied since 1 January 2018.

European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 — support for rural development
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The regulation:
sets out how the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) contributes to the development of rural areas and the agricultural sector over the 2014-2020 period to be: resilient, competitive and innovative,climate-friendly and environmentally-balanced,socially inclusive;
lays down the rules governing the EU’s support for rural development, funded by the EAFRD;
explains the EAFRD’s objectives and how it works.
It was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/2393 which introduced a series of technical modifications to the 5 regulations relating to the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP):
Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013;
Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 on financing, management and monitoring of the CAP;
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 on rules for direct payments to farmers;
Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 on the common organisation of agricultural markets in agricultural products;
Regulation (EU) No 652/2014 on management of expenditure.
It was further amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 which, among other things, lays down transitional provisions for implementing the EAFRD, including specific resources to help the recovery of the EU’s agricultural sector and rural areas following the COVID-19 pandemic.
KEY POINTS
Objectives
The EAFRD aims to:
foster competitiveness in agriculture;
ensure that natural resources are managed sustainably and that measures to tackle climate change are implemented effectively;
achieve a balanced territorial development of rural areas across the EU, including creating and maintaining employment.
Priorities
The EU supports action to meet 6 priority objectives:
fostering knowledge transfer and innovation;
enhancing viability and competitiveness of all types of agriculture and the sustainable management of forests;
promoting food chain organisation, including processing and marketing of agricultural products, animal welfare and risk management;
restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to agriculture and forestry;
promoting resource efficiency and the transition to a low-carbon economy;
promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas.
EU countries and regions may also address issues of particular importance in their area such as:
young farmers;
small farms;
mountain areas;
women in rural areas;
climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity.
Budget
The EAFRD’s budget was set at €99.3 billion in 2015. At least 30% of this must be used for measures to take care of the environment and combat climate change and 5% is reserved for local development strategies.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/791 revises the budget breakdown of EU support for rural development programmes (Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013).
2017 amendment of the regulation
Regulation (EU) 2017/2393, which has applied since 1 January 2018, aims to simplify and improve farmers’ access to finance under the CAP. Among other things, it introduces:
a new sector-specific income stabilisation tool providing compensation to farmers affected by a severe drop in their income;
support for insurance contracts in cases where more than 20% of a farmer’s average annual production is destroyed, for example due to adverse weather conditions.
Implementation
The regulation requires rural development policy to be consistent with other policies in this area. EU-level rules and agreements are in place to ensure that EU funding is used effectively, minimising overlaps and inconsistencies.
COVID-19 pandemic
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/872 provides exceptional temporary emergency assistance to farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) active in processing, marketing or development of agricultural products and cotton under the EAFRD.
EU Member States must target the support to beneficiaries who are most affected by the COVID-19 crisis, based on available evidence and objective and non-discriminatory selection criteria.
The support must take the form of a lump sum payment to be paid by 30 June 2021, based on applications for support approved by the national competent authority by 31 December 2020.
The maximum amount of support must not exceed €7,000 per farmer and €50,000 per SME.
Transitional rules for the years 2021 and 2022
Amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220, adopted in December 2020, allows for the continued application of the rules under the 2014-2020 CAP framework, and ensures the continuity of payments to farmers and other beneficiaries of support from the EAFRD in 2021 and 2022, until the new framework applies from 1 January 2023.
In addition, exceptional temporary support to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis will tackle ongoing liquidity problems that threaten the continuity of farming and of small businesses active in the processing, marketing or development of agricultural products.
The total amount of EU support for rural development from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 will be a maximum of €26,896,831,880 in current prices, in accordance with the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027.
A further amount of €8,070,486,840 in current prices is to be made available as additional resources under the EAFRD for the recovery of the EU agricultural sector and rural areas for the years 2021 and 2022. The regulation lays down detailed rules on how these funds should be allocated to priorities such as economic and social development, climate action, animal welfare, etc.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2014.
BACKGROUND
              
The EAFRD is one of 2 EU funds providing money to implement the CAP (the other being the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund). It supports the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy by encouraging rural development throughout the EU, working alongside other initiatives in this area to ensure the effective use of EU funding.

Summary 171:
Farmers in the Aegean islands - EU support
Farmers in the Aegean islands - EU support
The European Union has special rules to assist agriculture in the smaller Aegean islands that are affected by geographical and economic factors.
ACT
                  
Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 March 2013 laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006.
SUMMARY
WHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?
                     
It allows for special arrangements that aim to compensate these islands for the difficulties they face due to their remote location. It has two aims:
1.to guarantee the supply to these smaller islands of products that are essential for human consumption or processing, as well as agricultural inputs, at a cost that compensates for their isolation;
2.to ensure, in the longer term, the continuity and development of local production.
KEY POINTS
Management and budget
Greece decides on the appropriate geographical level at which to establish the programme and submits it to the Commission for approval. Each year, an amount of €23.93 million (of which no more than €7.11 million can be used to finance special supply arrangements) is available from the EU budget, as laid down in Article 18(2) and (3) of the regulation.
Specific supply arrangements
Where these are agreed, they are granted on condition that the impact of the economic advantage is passed on to the end-user who, as appropriate, may be the consumer in the case of products meant for direct consumption, the end processor or packager in the case of products meant for the processing or packaging industries or farmers in the case of products used for animal feed or as agricultural inputs.
The advantage is calculated as being equal to the amount of the aid. The managing authority may require a security to be lodged equal to the amount of the advantage.
Measures to assist local agricultural products
The programme may include measures to support the production, processing or sale of agricultural products in the outermost regions.
Each measure may include a variety of actions. For each action, the programme must define at least the beneficiaries, the eligibility conditions and the unit amount of aid allocated to that action.
Checks and penalties
Products that are the subject of specific supply arrangements are checked when they enter the smaller Aegean islands, as well as when they are exported or dispatched. Where the rules are not respected, the authorities may recover the advantage granted to operators (i.e. farmers and companies that own farms) and temporarily suspend/revoke their registration.
Measures to assist local agricultural products are verified by means of both administrative and on-the-spot checks. In the event of a wrongful payment, the beneficiary concerned is obliged to reimburse the amount in question.
WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?
                     
From 21 March 2013. Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006.
For further information, see the section on POSEI programmes and specific measures in favour of the smaller Aegean islands on the European Commission’s website.

Summary 172:
Rules for the compilation of statistics regarding goods carried by road
Rules for the compilation of statistics regarding goods carried by road
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 70/2012 — road freight statistics
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
It sets out the rules for the production of comparable EU-wide statistics on goods transport by road.
It revises and repeals Regulation (EC) No 1172/98, which had been amended several times, and aligns the regulation with the Lisbon treaty with regard to the delegation of powers to the European Commission to adopt supplementary legislation.
KEY POINTS
Scope
EU countries must each compile and transmit to the Commission (Eurostat) data relating to freight transported by means of road transport vehicles registered on their territory.
The regulation does not apply to freight transported by:
goods road transport vehicles whose authorised weight or dimensions exceed the limits normally permitted in the EU countries concerned;
agricultural vehicles, military vehicles and vehicles belonging to central or local public administrations, with the exception of goods road transport vehicles belonging to public companies , and in particular railway companies.
EU countries may exclude goods road transport vehicles whose load capacity or maximum permissible weight is lower than a certain limit. That limit may not exceed a load capacity of 3.5 tonnes or a maximum permissible weight of 6 tonnes in the case of single motor vehicles.
The regulation does not apply to Malta so long as the number of Maltese-registered goods road transport vehicles licensed to engage in the international carriage of freight by road does not exceed 400 vehicles.
Data collection and transmission
Every quarter, by means of sample surveys, EU countries must compile and transmit data to Eurostat relating to 3 areas:
vehicles (see the regulation’s Annexes I and II);
journeys (see the regulation’s Annex III);
goods (see the regulation’s Annexes IV and V).
EU countries must transmit data within 5 months of the end of the quarter under observation.
Dissemination of results
Eurostat disseminates the data no later than 12 months after the end of the period to which they relate.
Reports
When they forward the data for the first quarter, EU countries send a report to Eurostat on the methods used to compile data. They must also inform Eurostat if they make any substantial changes to these methods. Every year, they must provide Eurostat with information on sample sizes, non-response rates and, in the form of standard error or confidence intervals, the reliability of the main statistical results.
The Commission (Eurostat) must report for the first time by December 2014, and thereafter every 3 years, to the European Parliament and the Council on the regulation’s implementation.
Committee
The Commission is advised and assisted by the European Statistical System Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.
Powers delegated to the Commission
The Commission has not yet exercised the power to adopt delegated acts that the regulation granted to it. In a report, published in 2016, the Commission explained that neither economic and technical developments in the field of road freight transport nor conclusions of the Commission’s Working Groups on road freight statistics involving experts from EU countries raised the need to use these delegated powers.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 23 February 2012.

Summary 173:
Transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents between EU countries (until 2022)
Transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents between EU countries (until 2022)
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in EU countries of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It aims to put in place a fast, secure and standardised transmission procedure for judicial* and extrajudicial documents* in civil or commercial matters between parties located in different European Union (EU) countries.
Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2020/1784 (see summary) as of 1 July 2022.
KEY POINTS
Scope
This regulation applies to civil or commercial matters where it is necessary to transmit judicial or extrajudicial documents for transmission from one EU country to another.
It does not apply to: revenue,customs,administrative affairs orcases of state liability for actions or omissions in the exercise of state authority.
The regulation does not apply where the address of the person to be served is unknown.
Further improving the service (transmission) of judicial and extrajudicial documents
The regulation introduces:
a rule stipulating that the receiving agency has to take all necessary steps to transmit the document as soon as possible, and in any event within 1 month of receipt;
a standard form to inform the addressee of their right to refuse to accept the document to be served — at the time that it has been served — or by returning the document to the receiving agency within a week;
a rule stipulating that costs which arise from recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the EU country addressed must correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that country in advance, respecting the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination;
uniform conditions for service by postal services (registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent).
Agencies within EU countries ensure transmission
EU countries designate the agencies that are responsible for transmitting and receiving documents. They must provide the European Commission with their names and addresses, the geographical areas to which they apply, and their accepted languages and means of receipt of documents.
Each EU country also has a central body that is responsible for supplying information to the agencies, resolving any difficulties that may arise and forwarding requests for service by the transmitting agency to the relevant receiving agency in exceptional circumstances.
A federal state, one where there are several legal systems or which has autonomous territorial units, may name more than one such agency or central body. The designation is valid 5 years and maybe be renewed at 5-year intervals.
Speeding up the serving of judicial and extrajudicial documents
The applicant forwards documents to the transmitting agency and bears any costs of translation prior to transmitting the document. The transmitting agency is required to advise the applicant that, in the event that the document is not in a language which the addressee understands or in the official language of the EU country where service is to be effected, the latter can refuse to accept the document.
Documents must be transmitted directly and as soon as possible between the agencies by any appropriate means of transmission, as long as they are legible and faithful to the original. A request using the standard form as annexed to the regulation must be attached in one of the accepted languages that the EU countries indicate. The documents are exempt from legalisation or any equivalent formality. A receipt must be sent within 7 days by the receiving agency. The latter has to contact the transmitting agency as soon as possible in case of missing information.
Serving documents according to the law of the receiving EU country within 1 month
The receiving agency should either serve the document itself or have it served within 1 month. If this is not possible, the receiving agency must inform the transmitting agency and continue to try to serve the document. Serving is done according to the law of the receiving EU country, or by a particular method, if this is requested by the transmitting agency and it conforms to the national law. When service has been carried out, a certificate of completion of the formalities involved must be completed in a language accepted by the EU country of origin and sent to the transmitting agency.
The date of service will be the date on which the document is served, according to the law of the EU country addressed, except where it must be addressed within a particular period according to the law of that country. The service must not incur costs or taxes in the EU country addressed, except if there has been a particular method of service or recourse to a judicial officer there. In that case, it is up to the applicant to bear the costs. EU countries have to fix a single fee in advance, and communicate it to the Commission.
Documents may also be served directly by using registered post with a receipt or via the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the EU country addressed, if this is permitted by the country in question. In exceptional circumstances, documents may be forwarded to agencies of another EU country via consular or diplomatic channels.
Informing the addressee about the right to refuse the document to be served
The receiving agency informs the addressee of their right to refuse the document, if it is not written in a language that he or she understands or in the official language of the EU country where service takes place. The refusal must take place at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within a week.
If the document is a writ of summons (an official order for someone to appear in a court of law) or equivalent and the defendant does not appear, a judgment may not be pronounced until it is sure that the document was served according to the EU country’s domestic law, it was delivered and the defendant had sufficient time to submit a defence. However, judgment may be delivered if the document was transmitted by one of the methods laid down in the regulation, and if more than 6 months have elapsed and no certificate of any kind has been obtained in spite of every reasonable effort by the competent authorities of the EU country addressed. If the defendant did not know about the document in time to appear, it is still possible to apply for relief within a reasonable time after finding out about the judgment.
The Commission should provide and regularly update a manual containing the information provided by the EU countries. By 2011, and every 5 years subsequently, it must present a report on the regulation’s application, focusing on the agencies’ effectiveness.
Repeal
Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 is repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2020/1784 as of 1 July 2022.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 13 November 2008, except for Article 23 (on EU countries’ communication and publication of certain information) which has applied since 13 August 2008.
BACKGROUND

Summary 174:
EU rules for new medical products based on genes and cells
EU rules for new medical products based on genes and cells
SUMMARY
            
Scientific advances bring new medicinal products based on gene or somatic-cell* therapy and tissue engineering* to treat human diseases. Since December 2008, legislation aims to ensure these are both safe for patients and can be available throughout the EU.
WHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?
              
It lays down rules for authorising, supervising and monitoring advanced therapy medicinal products, known in the jargon as ATMPs. These can be used, for instance, in correcting knee cartilage defects in adults. The legislation protects patients from scientifically unsound treatments.
KEY POINTS
              
—
              The legislation creates a Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) within the European Medicines Agency. Its role is to give scientific opinions on the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products.
            
—
              The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use bases its authorisation decisions on the CAT’s opinions.
            
—
              Once authorisation is granted, the item is considered safe for human use throughout Europe.
            
—
              Manufacturers must comply with detailed labelling and packaging rules.
            
—
              Manufacturers must ensure that each product, and its raw materials, can be traced from initial sourcing through packaging, storage and delivery to its final destination.
            
—
              Hospitals and other medical locations must maintain traceability systems for both patients and the products used.
            
—
              Manufacturers must specify the remedial measures they will take if an authorised product is found to cause adverse reactions.
            
—
              Where there is particular cause for concern, the European Commission may request a manufacturer to establish a risk management system to identify, prevent or minimise any possible risks.
            
—
              The Commission draws up detailed guidelines on good clinical and manufacturing practice specific to advanced therapy medicinal products.
            
A Commission report of March 2014 examined the status of advanced therapies in the EU and how the regulation had worked in practice. It noted that the legislation had established a recognised framework for assessing new advanced therapies.
BACKGROUND
              
Significant research takes place in the EU into advanced therapies. The EU’s clinical trials database, EudraCT, recorded up to 250 between 2004 and 2010. Almost 70 % of the entities involved were SMEs or not-for-profit organisations. Multinational pharmaceutical companies accounted for under 2 %.
KEY TERMS
* Somatic-cell therapy: experimental method of cloning genes and reintroducing them into cells to correct an inherited disease.
* Tissue engineering: manufacture of organs to be implanted and used in the human body.
ACT
            
Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products and amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004

Reducing pollution from light motor vehicles
Reducing pollution from light motor vehicles
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 — type-approval of light passenger and commercial vehicles with respect to emissions (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
Regulation (EC) No 715/2007:
sets harmonised rules for emission type-approval of  cars and light commercial vehicles, known collectively as light-duty vehicles;
covers replacement, pollution control devices*, and sets out rules for their type-approval;
has been amended several times, most recently by Regulation (EU) 2018/858.
Regulation (EU) 2018/858:
overhauls the EU’s rules on vehicle type-approval;
introduces more robust testing methods with respect to pollutant emissions; and
repeals Directive 2007/46/EC on EU type-approval for vehicles from 31 August 2020.
KEY POINTS
              
The legislation applies to light-duty vehicles less than 2.6 tonnes.
Manufacturers must:
design, construct and assemble components so that the vehicle complies with the legislation;
prove that all new vehicles and new pollution control devices comply with the legislation and can meet the emission limits during a vehicle’s normal life under normal conditions of use on the road;
ensure that pollution control devices can last 160,000 km;
vehicles emissions can be checked after 5 years or 100,000 km, whichever is sooner;
provide buyers with carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption figures;
not use defeat devices that reduce the effectiveness of emission control systems, except under strict conditions — such as to protect an engine against damage or accident;
(until 1 September 2020) make available on websites unrestricted and standardised access to vehicle repair and maintenance information for independent garages. This should include items like service handbooks and technical manuals. They may charge a reasonable fee. These requirements are replaced by those in Regulation (EU) 2018/858 on 1 September 2020.
National authorities must:
give EU type-approval* to new vehicles that comply with the legislation;
refuse to grant approval to vehicles that do not meet the emissions standards, within the authorised deadlines relating to each vehicle category;
allow the registration of vehicles complying with this regulation;
ban the sale or installation of pollution control devices that do not meet the EU standards;
ensure penalties exist for manufacturers that falsify declarations or results, withhold data, or make use of defeat devices.
The Commission keeps under regular review the procedures, tests, requirements and emission limits set out in the legislation and regularly updates them in implementing legislation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 3 January 2009.

Summary 176:
Authorisation procedure for additives, enzymes and flavourings
Authorisation procedure for additives, enzymes and flavourings
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings
Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?
Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 introduces a harmonised, effective, fast and transparent authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings in the EU, aiming to facilitate the free movement of food while assuring consumer health. It does not apply to smoke flavourings.
The procedure is based on a risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), set up under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, and leads to the updating of a Community (EU) list for each of the 3 categories of substance.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 introduces new rules on transparency and confidentiality in risk assessment.
KEY POINTS
Common procedure
Only substances authorised for the EU market are on the EU list, which is updated on the initiative of the European Commission, of an EU country or of another interested party through an official application.
The Commission forwards applications for substances to be included on the list to EFSA for risk assessment (mandatory where there could be an effect on human health). EFSA must normally respond within 9 months. In justified cases where EFSA requests additional information from applicants, the period may be extended. EFSA makes public, under the 2019 amendment, any additional information supplied by the applicant.
The Commission issues a draft regulation updating the EU list within 9 months of receiving EFSA’s opinion.
The process may be halted by the Commission at any time. In urgent cases, there are special arrangements for adding, removing or changing conditions for substances on the list.
The Commission is assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed in updating the EU list.
Implementation
The Commission had 2 years from the adoption of the regulations on additives, enzymes and flavourings, after consultation with EFSA on risk assessment, to finalise how it would deal with applications, including:
content, drafting and presentation;
checking the validity of applications;
the type of information to be included.
Transparency
Under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, EFSA ensures the transparency of its activities in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 introduces new rules on transparency requiring EFSA, where the Commission requests its opinion, to make the application public without delay, including relevant supporting information and additional information supplied by the applicant, as well as its scientific opinions. EFSA makes public any request for its opinion as well as any extension of time limits for its work.
Confidentiality
Under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, applicants may request certain parts of their applications to be treated as confidential, along with verifiable justification.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 allows EFSA to also grant confidentiality for the following, where applicable, if the applicant demonstrates that disclosure could significantly harm its interests (except for information relevant to the assessment of safety): information provided on material used to manufacture the substance concerned;information on the materials or products in which the applicant intends to use the substance;detailed analytical information on the variability and stability of individual production batches.
Emergencies
If there is an emergency connected with a substance on the list, the Commission initiates EFSA food safety procedures.
Companion legislation
The 2008 regulation was adopted at the same time as the following companion legislation, which goes into more detail on the 3 categories:
Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 on food enzymes (see summary);
Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives (see summary);
Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on flavourings (see summary).
FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
              
Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 has applied since 20 January 2009.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1381 applies from 27 March 2021.

Accreditation and market surveillance
Accreditation and market surveillance
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 — setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It lays down common rules for accrediting bodies that ensure non-food products in the European Union (EU) conform to certain requirements.
It establishes a surveillance system to guarantee a high level of safety of those products and in general their compliance with applicable requirements.
It also sets rules in regard to controls on imports from outside the EU; and establishes the general principles for CE marking*.
KEY POINTS
National accreditation bodies
EU countries must:
appoint a single not-for-profit national accreditation organisation;
ensure the organisation has sufficient finance and staff to carry out its duties;
monitor the organisation to ensure it fulfils the requirements given;
communicate the relevant details to the European Commission which draws up a publicly available list of the various national organisations.
National accreditation bodies must:
determine whether individual conformity assessment organisations* are competent to do their work and monitor their performance;
restrict, suspend or withdraw accreditation certificates for assessment organisations that become unable to carry out their duties;
be objective and impartial with efficient management and appropriate internal controls in place;
agree to peer evaluation;
inform other national accreditation bodies of their conformity assessment activities;
make regularly publicly available information on their work.
The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) manages the peer evaluations to ensure the quality of the services the national accreditation bodies provide.
EU market surveillance and import controls
EU countries must:
organise and carry out market surveillance to ensure the safety of products;
withdraw, restrict or ban products that could damage the health or safety of users and immediately inform the Commission of the action they have taken;
establish procedures for handling and dealing with complaints;
ensure national market surveillance authorities are appointed and provided with sufficient resources to carry out their tasks;
ensure national market surveillance authorities cooperate and exchange information with each other;
establish rules on penalties, which may include criminal sanctions, for serious breaches of the law.
Market surveillance authorities must:
carry out appropriate checks on a sufficient scale, taking account of risk assessments, complaints and other information;
alert users in their own country of any dangers they discover;
inform the EU’s rapid information system (RAPEX) of any serious risks;
exchange information on product compliance via a common EU database;
cooperate with authorities in other EU countries.
National customs authorities may prevent an imported product from being sold in the EU if they believe it poses a serious risk to health, safety, the environment or any other public interest.
CE marking may only be attached to a product by a manufacturer or someone mandated to operate on their behalf, provided it satisfies all the conformity standards.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2010.
BACKGROUND
It is essential that non-food products that can move freely between EU countries do not pose a danger to the public, the environment or general security.
Accreditation is part of an overall system that includes conformity assessment and market surveillance. Provisions in the regulation for the latter complement those set out in other pieces of EU legislation.
For more information, see:
‘Market surveillance for products’ on the European Commission's website.
* KEY TERMS
              
CE marking: a marking manufacturers use to indicate the item meets EU legal conformity standards.
Conformity assessment body: a body that performs activities which include calibration, testing, certification and inspection.

Judicial authorities will refuse to carry out an arrest warrant if:
the offence is covered by an amnesty;
the person has already been tried for the same offence and has served or is serving their sentence;
the person cannot be held criminally responsible because of their age.
Optional grounds for refusal:
Countries can refuse to carry out an arrest warrant if:
the acts are not an offence in the country being asked to carry out the arrest warrant, that is, the executing state (except in relation to taxes, duties, customs and exchange);
the person is being prosecuted in the executing state for the same offence;
the state has passed a final judgement in respect of the same offence, which prevents further proceedings;
the authorities in the executing state have decided not to prosecute the person or have halted proceedings;
the criminal prosecution or punishment of the requested person is barred by statute in the executing state;
the requested person is a national or resident of the executing state and that state undertakes to carry out the sentence;
the offences were committed outside the issuing state or its laws do not permit prosecution for those offences.
Fundamental rights
The agreement states that it respects fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, or Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
It also states it should not be interpreted as prohibiting the refusal to surrender a person:
where the arrest warrant may have been issued on the grounds of sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation;
where that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.
Political offence exception
The executing state may not refuse to carry out an arrest warrant on the grounds that it regards the offence as political. The parties can, however, limit this option to offences covered by Directive (EU) 2017/541 on combating terrorism and by Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, 1977.
Surrender procedure
The arrested person must be informed at the time of the arrest of the contents of the warrant, the possibility of consenting to surrender to the issuing authority, and the right to be assisted by legal counsel and an interpreter.
The person may remain in detention or be released provisionally, provided that measures are taken to prevent absconding.
The hearing is conducted under the laws of the executing state and in agreed conditions.
The person can choose to voluntarily consent to surrender, if this is with full knowledge of the consequences.
The person should be surrendered where possible within 10 days of the decision to execute the warrant or of the surrender date agreed between the authorities.
The executing authority seizes and hands over property that may serve as evidence or that has been acquired by the person as a result of the offence.
The parties will permit the transit through their territory of a person being surrendered, provided that they have full information about the warrant.
Expenses
All expenses are borne by the issuing state, except those incurred in the territory of the executing state in connection with carrying out an arrest warrant.
Disputes and review
Any disputes should be referred to a meeting of representatives of the governments of the parties and settled within 6 months.

Rail passenger rights
Rail passenger rights
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims at establishing rights and obligations for rail passengers in order to protect them particularly when travel is disrupted, and to improve the efficiency and attractiveness of rail passenger services.
KEY POINTS
Scope
The regulation concerns all rail journeys and services provided under licence by one or more rail undertakings under Directive 2012/34/EU (see summary on A single railway network for Europe).
It does not apply to journeys and services carried out on non-EU countries' territory.
An EU country can opt to grant an exemption from most articles of the regulation to domestic rail passenger services for a maximum period of 5 years, which may be renewed twice. It may also exempt urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services from this regulation.
Passengers’ rights
Rail passengers have the following basic rights:
Transport contract and information
Passengers should be given clear and accessible information:
before the journey, in particular concerning the relevant conditions applicable to the contract, timetables and the fares applied;
during the journey, in particular concerning any delays or interruptions to services;
concerning procedures for the submission of complaints;
The information provided to persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility shall be in an accessible format.
Delays and cancellations
In the case of a delay of more than 60 minutes in the arrival at final destination, passengers have the right to:
the reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket for the part of the journey not made; or
continuation or re-routing under comparable transport conditions at the earliest opportunity or at a later date at the passengers’ convenience.
If passengers do not opt for reimbursement but for continuation of the journey, they may claim a minimum compensation equivalent to:
25% of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes;
50% of the ticket price for a delay of 120 minutes or more.
In the case of a delay in arrival or departure of more than 60 minutes, passengers have the right to:
receive information on the situation and the estimated departure and arrival time;
meals and refreshments within reasonable limits;
accommodation where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary;
transport to the railway station or to the alternative departure point or to the final destination if the train is blocked on the track.
Persons with disability and reduced mobility
The EU rail passenger rights legislation will ensure that persons with disability and reduced mobility can travel in a way that is comparable to other citizens. Thus, the regulation gives them the following rights:
the right to non-discriminatory access to transport at no additional charge;
upon request, to be provided with information concerning the accessibility of rail services and stations;
an assistance free of charge on board trains and at staffed stations (passengers are requested to give 48 hours’ notice of their assistance needs before departure);
the right to compensation if the rail undertaking is responsible for the loss or damage of their mobility equipment.
Security, complaints and service quality
Passengers’ personal security is ensured in trains and stations in cooperation with the public authorities.
An effective complaints handling mechanism has to be put in place. Passengers may complain to any rail undertaking involved.
The minimum service quality standards for rail undertakings include: passenger information and tickets;punctuality of service and general principles to cope with disruptions;cancellation of services;cleanliness of rolling stock and station facilities;customer satisfaction surveys;complaint handling, refunds and compensation for non-compliance with service quality standards;assistance provided to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
Enforcement by EU countries
EU countries must designate an independent body or bodies in charge of the enforcement of the regulation. Passengers can submit a complaint to any of these bodies if they feel that their rights have not been respected.
EU countries must also set up effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for infringements of the regulation.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?

Statistics on education and lifelong learning
Statistics on education and lifelong learning
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 452/2008 — production and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning
Regulation (EU) 2019/1700 establishing a common framework for European statistics relating to persons and households and amending Regulation (EC) No 452/2008
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It establishes a common framework on statistical standards for the production of harmonised data in the area of education and lifelong learning.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation covers the following domains:
1.education and training systems;
2.other statistics on education and lifelong learning (such as statistics on human capital and on the social and economic benefits of education).
The production of statistics at European Union (EU) level is implemented by individual statistical actions including:
for the first domain, regular and timely delivery of statistics by EU countries;
within the scope of the second domain, the use of supplementary variables and indicators from other statistical information systems and surveys;
developing, improving and updating standards and manuals that define frameworks, concepts and methods;
improving data quality within the context of the quality framework.
The European Commission will take into consideration the available capacities of EU countries with regard to the above actions. For the collected data, consideration will be given to regional and gender aspects whenever possible.
The Commission (Eurostat) will also collaborate with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other international organisations to ensure the comparability and avoid the duplication of data at international level.
Education systems (UOE)

Common system for the production of energy statistics
Common system for the production of energy statistics
SUMMARY OF
Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on EU energy statistics
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It sets up a system to produce EU-wide statistics on energy products* and their aggregates*.
It also applies to European Economic Area countries.
It covers the entire process of collecting, transmitting, evaluating and disseminating the data.
KEY POINTS
Terminology
Technical terms are defined and clarified in the regulation’s Annex A.
Data sources
EU countries are required to compile statistics concerning energy products and their aggregates from the following sources:
specific surveys addressed to the primary* and transformed* energy producers and traders, distributors and transporters, importers and exporters of energy products;
other surveys addressed to final energy users in the sectors of manufacturing industry, transport, and other sectors, including households;
other estimation procedures or other sources, including administrative sources, such as regulators of the electricity and gas markets.
Transmission and dissemination of data
Reporting countries must transmit national statistics to the European Commission (Eurostat) as laid down in the regulation’s annexes:
annually for energy statistics in Annex B;
monthly for energy statistics in Annex C (data must be transmitted to Eurostat within 55 days following the reported month);
short-term monthly for the energy statistics in Annex D (data must be transmitted to Eurostat within one calendar month of the month reported).
The transmission arrangements, including the applicable time limits, and any exceptions and exemptions are set out in the annexes. Over time, these arrangements may be modified by the Commission.
Eurostat must disseminate annual statistics no later than 31 January of the second year after the reported period.
Quality assessment and reports
EU countries are responsible for the quality of the data they transmit to Eurostat. In particular, they must ensure that energy data they declare under this regulation matches data they declare with regard to the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation.
The Commission (Eurostat) assesses the quality of data from several perspectives including their relevance, punctuality, accessibility, clarity and comparability.
Every 5 years, EU countries must provide Eurostat with a report on the quality of the data transmitted, as well as on any changes in methodology that have been made.
Annual nuclear statistics
As of 2009, EU countries have been preparing statistics on the nuclear sector. The set of statistics collected concerns the civil use of nuclear energy.
Renewable energy and final energy consumption statistics
To ensure better quality and more comprehensive renewable energy and final energy consumption statistics, the Commission, with the EU countries, is reviewing and revising the methodologies used in their production. In particular, countries are required to transmit more disaggregated* data for final energy consumption in households as from reference year 2015 and more detailed data on renewable energies as from reference year 2017.
Implementing legislation
The Commission is granted the power to adopt supplementary legislation designed to implement this regulation.
Committee
The Commission (Eurostat) is assisted and advised by the European Statistical System Committee, a committee composed of representatives from EU countries and chaired by the Commission.

Aquaculture statistics
Aquaculture statistics
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 762/2008 on the submission by EU countries of statistics on aquaculture
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?
              
It sets up a common system for the production of EU statistics on the aquaculture* sector, to help review and assess the market for aquaculture products as part of sound management of the common fisheries policy.
The regulation repeals Council Regulation (EC) No 788/96.
KEY POINTS
              
EU countries must submit annual statistics on all the aquaculture carried out on their territory using surveys or other approved methods covering at least 90% of production, with the remaining part being estimated, unless an exemption is approved.
If total annual production is less than 1,000 tonnes the country can submit summary data estimating the total production.
Production must be identified by species, but species totalling less than 500 tonnes or 5% of total production can be estimated and aggregated. Hatchery and nursery* production of these species may be estimated.
Data are submitted within 12 months of the end of the calendar year, and include:
annual aquaculture production volume and value;
annual input to capture-based aquaculture*;
annual production of hatcheries and nurseries;
structure of the aquaculture sector (every 3 years).
Quality assessment
Each EU country provides a yearly report on the quality of the data submitted and a detailed methodological report. The latter describes how the data were collected and compiled, including:
sampling techniques,
estimation methods and sources used other than surveys, as well as
an evaluation of the quality of the estimates.
The European Commission (Eurostat) examines the reports and presents its conclusions to the Fisheries statistics Working Group.
Evaluation report
Every 3 years, the European Commission submits an evaluation report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the statistics compiled, and in particular on relevance and quality. The report also includes a cost-effectiveness analysis of the statistics collection system indicating best practice to reduce workload and to enhance the usefulness and quality of the data.

Future international cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries
Future international cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 control and enforcement system for the north-east Atlantic fisheries area
Convention on cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to promote international cooperation on the conservation, control and good management of the fisheries in the north-east Atlantic area.
It enacts the Convention on Multilateral Cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries which sets out rules for cooperation on the conservation and management of fisheries.
In particular, the regulation implements the NEAFC Scheme of Control and Enforcement, which provides for
control and enforcement measures for vessels flying the flag of its contracting parties;
arrangements for inspections at sea;
surveillance; and
infringement procedures.
KEY POINTS
              
The scheme creates a new port state control system which will effectively close European ports to landings and transhipments* of frozen fish which have not been verified to be legal.
EU countries must:
designate a competent authority which acts as the contact point to receive surveillance and inspection reports, available 24 hours a day;
send the European Commission a list of all vessels flying their flag registered in the EU that are authorised to fish in the area covered by the regulation;
undertake to retrieve on a regular basis lost fishing gear belonging to vessels flying their flag.
Vessel masters must:
log each entry and exit from the regulatory area*, the estimated cumulative catch, the amount of fish discarded, and the fishing depth;
send catch reports to their Fisheries Monitoring Centre*, which can then be accessed by the Commission.
Masters of vessels which process and/or freeze their catch must record the species and type of product and stow fish products in the hold in a way that allows each species to be identified from a stowage plan kept on board. When frozen, all fish must be identified with a clearly legible label or stamp.
When more than 10 EU fishing vessels are engaged in fishing activities* carried out in the regulatory area, an inspection vessel will be present.
Each EU country must inspect at least 5% of landings or transhipments of fresh fish and at least 7.5% of frozen fish in its ports during each reporting year.
When inspectors find that a fishing vessel has engaged in activity contrary to NEAFC conservation and management measures, they shall record and report the infringement.
Serious infringements include:
fishing without authorisation;
fishing without quota;
using prohibited fishing gear;
misrecording catches;
falsifying the marking or identity of vessels;
preventing an inspector from carrying out their duties.
EU countries’ inspectors must also report any unauthorised vessels they record to the Commission.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2011.
BACKGROUND
              
The north-east Atlantic is one of the most abundant fishing areas in the world. The Convention on Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries entered into force in November 1982. The contracting parties to the Convention are the EU, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and the Russian Federation, and the area covered stretches from the southern tip of Greenland, east to the Barents Sea and south to Portugal.
In 2006, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a recommendation establishing a scheme of control and enforcement on fishing vessels operating in the area covered by the Convention.
It also included rules for vessels flying the flag of a non-contracting party to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by the NEAFC.
The NEAFC has recommended removing a number of vessels that have been engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries.
Similar rules are in force in EU waters under the common fisheries policy.
KEY TERMS
              
Transhipment: the transfer of a catch from one fishing boat to another which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.
Regulatory area: the waters covered by the convention which lie beyond the jurisdiction of the contracting parties. See map.
Fisheries Monitoring Centre: an operational centre based in an EU country which can receive, process and transmit fisheries data.
Fishing activities: fishing, fish processing operations, the transhipment or landing of fish or fish products, and any other commercial activity in preparation for or related to fishing, including packaging, transporting, refuelling or resupplying.

Summary 185:
Ecolabel
Ecolabel
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 on the EU Ecolabel
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
It concerns the European Union (EU) Ecolabel which is a voluntary environmental labelling scheme.
By means of transparent ecological criteria, it enables consumers to make conscious choices without compromising on the quality of the products.
KEY POINTS
The EU Ecolabel may be awarded to products and services which have a lower environmental impact than other products in the same group. The label criteria were devised using scientific data on the whole of a product’s life cycle, from product development to disposal.
The label may be awarded to all goods or services distributed, consumed or used on the EU market whether in return for payment or free of charge, on condition that the ecological criteria have been clearly established. It does not apply to medicinal products for human or veterinary use, or to medical devices.
The system was introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 880/92 and amended by Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. This Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 aims to improve the rules on the award, use and operation of the label.
Award criteria
The label is awarded in consideration of European environmental and ethical objectives. It also promotes the EU’s transition to a circular economy, supporting both sustainable production and consumption. In particular:
the impact of goods and services on climate change, nature and biodiversity, energy and resource consumption, generation of waste, pollution, emissions and the release of hazardous substances into the environment;
the substitution of hazardous substances by safer substances;
durability and reusability of products;
ultimate impact on the environment, including on consumer health and safety;
compliance with social and ethical standards, such as international labour standards;
taking into account criteria established by other labels at national and regional levels;
reducing animal testing.
The label cannot be awarded to products containing substances classified by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as toxic, hazardous to the environment, carcinogenic or mutagenic, or substances subject to the regulatory framework for the management of chemicals.
Competent bodies
EU countries must designate one or more bodies responsible for the labelling process at national level. Their operations shall be transparent and their activities shall be open to the involvement of all interested parties.
They are specifically responsible for regularly checking that products comply with the label criteria. Their remit also includes receiving complaints, informing the public, monitoring false advertising and prohibiting products.
The procedure for award and use of the label
In order to be awarded the label, economic operators shall submit an application to:
one or more EU countries, which will send it to the competent national body;
a non-EU country, which will send it to the EU country where the product is marketed.
If the product complies with the label criteria, the competent body shall conclude a contract with the operator, establishing the terms of use and withdrawal of the label. The operator may then place the label on the product. The use of the label is subject to payment of a fee when the application is made, and an annual fee.
The European Commission has created a catalogue of products which have been awarded the label.
The European Union Ecolabelling Board (EUEB)
A 2010 Commission decision (Decision 2010/709/EU) establishes the EUEB. Its members are appointed by the Commission. It is composed of representatives from the EU countries and the European Economic Area, as well as from certain European organisations representing, for example, consumers, business and environmental concerns. The Commission consults the EUEB when developing or revising the award criteria and requirements of the label.
Ecological criteria
The Commission has adopted a series of decisions establishing ecological criteria for the awarding of the EU Ecolabel to different types of products; for several of these, the validity period expired by the end of December 2016.
The Commission also adopted Regulation (EU) No 782/2013 replacing Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 and amending the maximum fees allowed for financing the evaluation and processing of requests for the Ecolabel made by product manufacturers.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 19 February 2010.

Supplementary protection certificates for medicines and plant protection products
Supplementary protection certificates for medicines and plant protection products
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 — supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products
Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 — supplementary protection certificate for pharmaceutical products
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THESE REGULATIONS?
They provide additional protection for specific patented pharmaceutical and plant protection products that have been approved for sale.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/933 introduced a manufacturing waiver to the protection given by a supplementary protection certificate (SPC)* for pharmaceutical products that allows EU-based companies to manufacture a generic or similar version of an SPC-protected medicine during the term of the certificate:either for exporting to a non-EU market; orfor stockpiling during the final 6 months of an SPC, ahead of entry into the EU market.
This European Union protection is designed to even out any disparities and shortcomings in national pharmaceutical and plant protection product patent systems.
KEY POINTS
Any pharmaceutical or plant protection product may receive an SPC, where: it is protected by a national patent (the basic patent);it must have national or EU authorisation before it may be sold (marketing authorisation); andit does not already have a certificate.
The SPC confers the same rights as those provided by the basic patent, apart from the limitations of the manufacturing waiver explained above.
The SPC application must be lodged with the relevant national industrial property office: within 6 months of the marketing authorisation being granted; orwhere the marketing authorisation is granted before the basic patent is granted, within 6 months of the date on which the patent is granted.
The SPC takes effect when the basic patent expires, and is valid for up to 5 years. The overall protection a patent and an SPC can provide may not be more than 15 years from the granting of the first marketing authorisation.
The SPC may be extended once for 6 months for pharmaceutical products for children where a paediatric investigation plan has been prepared. The overall protection provided is then 15,5 years.
FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 has applied since 8 February 1997, except in those countries whose national law did not cover the patentability of plant protection products, where it has applied since 2 January 1998.
Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 codifies Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92. It has applied since 6 July 2009.
Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/933 has applied since 1 July 2019.
BACKGROUND
The time between applying for a patent for a new pharmaceutical or plant protection product and receiving authorisation to place it on the market reduces the effective period of patent protection. The SPC aims to offset that reduction in the effective patent protection in these fields of research to encourage innovation and prevent these industries moving away from EU countries.

KEY TERMS
              
Supplementary protection certificate: an intellectual property right for a specific product that acts as an extension of a patent.

Summary 187:
Strengthening cooperation with Switzerland, Norway and Iceland: the Lugano Convention
Strengthening cooperation with Switzerland, Norway and Iceland: the Lugano Convention
SUMMARY OF:
Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
Council Decision 2009/430/EC — conclusion of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION AND THE DECISION?
              
The Convention aims to achieve the same level of circulation of judgments between the EU countries and Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. Known as the new Lugano Convention, it replaces the Lugano Convention of 1988.
The decision concludes the convention on behalf of the European Community (now the EU). It also establishes the declarations to be made at the time of depositing the instrument of ratification (annexed to the decision).
KEY POINTS
Application
The convention applies to jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
It does not apply to:
tax, customs and administrative matters;
the status and legal capacity of natural persons;
rights in property arising from matrimonial relationships;
wills and succession;
bankruptcy or composition;
social security or arbitration.
Achieving a high level of circulation of judgmentsThe convention, signed by the European Community, along with Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, was to come into force once it is ratified by the signatories. Denmark was a separate contracting party to this convention, because it had opted out of the then Brussels I regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001) — subsequently replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on court jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
The contracting parties deposit their instruments of ratification with the Swiss Federal Council, which serves as depositary of the convention. On coming into force, the convention is open to:
future members of the European Free Trade Association;
EU countries acting on behalf of certain non-European territories that are part of their territory (for example French overseas territories such as Nouméa) or for whose external relations they are responsible;
any other state, subject to the unanimous agreement of all the contracting parties.
Based on the rules applicable between EU countries
The convention follows the present rules of the EU on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between EU countries. This means that the rules are similar in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. The convention also facilitates the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments handed down by the national courts of these countries.
The convention requires that, in general, persons domiciled (legally resident) in a state bound by the convention are sued in that state, whatever their nationality. However, it also provides for special rules of jurisdiction in certain matters, such as:
contracts: the courts of the country where the obligation is enforced have jurisdiction;
maintenance: jurisdiction resides with the courts of the place where the maintenance creditor (the person entitled to the payments for which the judgment provides) is domiciled or habitually resident;
tort (a wrongful act or an infringement of a right giving rise to injury or harm), delict (a wrongful act for which the person injured has the right to a civil remedy) or quasi-delict (a negligent act or omission which causes harm or damage to the person or property of another, and thus exposes a person to civil liability in civil law jurisdictions): jurisdiction resides with the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur.
The convention also provides for specific jurisdictions in matters relating to:
insurance;
consumer contracts; and
individual contracts of employment.
Jurisdiction in matters relating to tenancies (possession of land or property as a tenant) and real property rights resides exclusively with the courts of the contracting state in which the property is situated.A number of protocols are annexed to the convention, among other things to ensure that the convention is interpreted as uniformly as possible.
FROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE CONVENTION APPLY?
              
The decision has applied since 27 November 2009. The convention entered into force between the EU and Norway on 1 January 2010, between the EU and Switzerland on 1 January 2011 and between the EU and Iceland on 1 May 2011, in accordance with Article 69(5) of the convention.
BACKGROUND
              
The signing of the convention marked a major institutional development. In its Opinion 1/03, the Court of Justice confirmed that the European Community was exclusively competent to conclude the new Lugano Convention. Signed on 30 October 2007, the convention is a key part of EU law and runs for an unlimited period.
